"From Slash gear:

The sensors have also been positioned so as to avoid build-up of snow or water, Musk explained. Like the current sensors, they’re heated, too, which can shed a snow crust. Finally, there’ll be an on-screen warning, telling the driver to clean any impaired sensors before setting off."
"Musk says that by the end of next year they plan a demonstration drive from coast to coast with no human intervention, including charging.

Audio of the press conference. Bullet point notes of info not immediately visible on tesla.com

* Elon says this hardware is capable for Level 5.
* Close call, but went with Nvidia for processing hardware. AMD, and then Intel, were next in line
* Spent over a year in testing with this hardware
* Feature set will disabled for at least first few months, predicts December 2016
* Significant improvements will be released every ~3 months
* Demonstration of LA to NYC by the end of 2017 without any human touch, including charging
* Autopilot 1.0 will continue to get better, but it is fundamentally limited by hardware
* Upgrading Hardware 1 cars will not happen, akin to a spinal transplant
* 2.0 GPS is more accurate, minor sensor improvements on IMU and others
* System will always be operating in shadow mode to demonstrate to regulators when computer would or wouldn't have acted in accidents
* No way to turn it into a kit for other manufacturers, requires too much integration, not realistic
* Heater elements around all camera surfaces to prevent snow and ice
* Positioning of cameras is such that dust or ice accumulation is unlikely
* Initial testing on closed track with Tesla's engineers, then alpha tested by Elon and close group of others, then goes to Early Access Program, 1,000 technically savvy customers around the world, then rolled-out in shadow mode to whole fleet, then activated"
Who wants to buy a 2 week old Model X?
"From the Q&A

""Musk largely begged off talking about what the regulation would or should be but he did note that the computer will “always be running in ‘shadow mode,’” so that he can build the case that his self-driving software would have been safer than human drivers.""

I love this - it's surely the fastest way to change legislation when you have the data to say 'if this person wasn't driving they would not have died'

Powerful stuff"
"85D with autopilot 1.0 for sale.  Take over payments!
"
"From the [design studio.](https://www.tesla.com/models/design) (same for both Model S and Model X)

**Enhanced Autopilot**

> Enhanced Autopilot adds new capabilities to the Tesla Autopilot driving experience. The enhancements include going from one to four cameras for greater accuracy, redundancy, and to see fast-approaching vehicles in adjacent lanes. In addition, 12 ultrasonic sonar sensors provide 360 degree coverage around your car with almost twice the range and resolution of the prior version. The significantly increased sensor information is processed by a computer that is over 40 times more powerful than before. Your Tesla will match speed to traffic conditions, Keep within a lane, automatically change lanes without requiring driver input, transition from one freeway to another, exit the freeway when your destination is near, sen-park when near a parking spot and be summoned to and from your garage. That said, Enhanced Autopilot should still be considered a driver's assistance feature with the driver responsible for remaining in control of the car at all times. Tesla's Enhanced Autopilot software is expected to complete validation and be rolled out to your car via an over-the-air update in December 2016, subject to regulatory approval.

$5,000 *($6,000 upgrade after delivery)*


**Full Self-Driving Capability**

> This doubles the number of active cameras from four to eight, enabling full self-driving in almost all circumstances, at what we believe will be a probability of safety at least twice as good as the average human driver. The system is designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver's seat. For Superchargers that have automatic charge connection enabled, you will not even need to plug in your vehicle. All you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go. If you don't say anything, the car will look at your calendar and take you there as the assumed destination or just home if nothing is on the calendar. Your Tesla will figure out the optimal route, navigate urban streets (even without lane markings), manage complex intersections with traffic lights, stop signs and roundabouts, and handle densely packed freeways with cars moving at high speed. When you arrive at your destination, simply step out at the entrance and your car will enter park seek mode, automatically search for a spot and park itself. A tap on your phone summons it back to you. Please note that Self-Driving functionality is dependent upon extensive software validation and regulatory approval, which may vary widely by jurisdiction. It is not possible to Know exactly when each element of the functionality described above will be available, as this is highly dependent on local regulatory approval. Please note also that using a self-driving Tesla for car sharing and ride hailing for friends and family is fine, but doing so for revenue purposes will only be permissible on the Tesla Network, details of which will be released next year.

$3,000 *($4,000 after delivery)*

*Requires Enhanced Autopilot*"
"Musk started off the call with a testy answer - defending Tesla Autopilot and laying into media outlets that don’t put the accidents that have happened from it into the proper context. Autonomous driving is so much safer, Musk argues, that outlets that put too much emphasis on the crash are “killing people,” Musk argued. He then added: “next question.”

Musk also promised a demonstration of a fully autonomous drive from Los Angeles to New York by the end of 2017.

"My favorite part of this is the richer data collection this allows. Currently they've got a massive lead by number of miles, but it's hard to compare the importance of miles vs. data richness.

It's still possible they could show the new autonomous features in the final Model 3 (with the final interior) in the demo video they're going to be posting.

"> Most significantly, new Teslas won’t have access to some safety features that older Teslas have, including automatic emergency braking, collision warning, lane holding, and active cruise control. The company says that these features will be activated after they are “robustly validated.”

so at start the new cars will be worse than existing ones?"
"So they delayed the announcement for 2 days. Would that have been because there were vehicles in the factory that would not receive the autopilot hardware on time? Musk said they needed ""a few more days of refinement."" It almost sounds like full autopilot was supposed to be ready for demo or something?"
"Called it. You naysayers. A HUD wouldn't prompt a bunch of new people to buy a new Tesla Model 3. Autopilot would.

Only downside is the unknown timeline for software rollout, including the features we've come to know and love as standard options like lane assist, collision detection warning, emergency braking, and active cruise control. Buying a tesla now with the AP 2.0 hardware, but not being able to use basic AP 1.0 features seems like a bit of a lose for early adopters of the next generation."
"Did he just announced that we now have the tech for fully self driving car, a level 5 autonomy car?

"So any ideas how long it will take this ""AP 2.0"" system to rack up ""millions of miles""?  (Let's assume 3 million)"
I've been considering leasing my model 3 based on future hardware upgrades. Now I think I'm buying it.

"So why was this considered part 2 of the model 3 unveiling? Don't get me wrong autonomous driving is cool, but I was under the impression they were showing off the interior of the model 3 and how it drives and all of that stuff. This was really underwhelming by comparison. "
It is crazy how fast Telsa innovates. I wonder how long they have been working on Tesla vision? It seems only like the last 6 months. The new system seems incredible. Elon throwing a ton of great hardware on the car and tells the software team to make it happen. I love it.

"I'm as much of a Tesla fanboy as the rest of the crew here, but I got into an argument yesterday with someone that wasn't excited for self driving cars. One of his main points was the ability for hackers to get into the software and create a weapon with the car itself. I'm pretty sure that Tesla has figured this out and has good encryption, but I didn't have a great answer for my buddy. Can anyone point me to sources dealing with Tesla and ""the hacker issue?"""

"So does this mean that when no one is piloting the car, it can ride in the HOV/Carpool lanes in California? That is hilarious... the irony that you need 2 people and now you need 0 lol."

> Please note that using a self-driving Tesla for car sharing and ride hailing for friends and family is fine, but doing so for revenue purposes will only be available on the Tesla network, details of which will be released next year.

They're basically enforcing through end user agreement what consumers are allowed to do with their cars.  I understand that Tesla's depending on the revenue they'll generate by selling vehicles to ride sharing services, but just like consumers have the right to jailbreak their phones, we also have the right to use our vehicles for whatever purposes we want."
"Juts to confirm, is retro fitting older models possible or not possible? 

EDIT: Elon did address this, ""Should mention that retrofitting to full self-driving hardware is very difficult. Cost delta is more than buying a new car. Wish it weren't."""

Interesting to see they still have one forward facing radars instead of three that was speculated a while back. I guess they have enough confidence in the 8 cameras
Is there  live stream for the announcement? 
I'll say what I said in the pre-announce thread:  I hope everybody bought their stock while it was on sale.

How is it going to detect oncoming fast cars from behind in a lane change? i dont think you can do it reliably with just cameras and no rear facing radar. It says the cameras can see up to 250 meters but that doesnt mean they can measure a car speed right?

Wonder how many current owners are salty...... 
I guess the market didn't like the announcement that much.
"What are the implications of the relatively short range rearward looking sensors e.g. the Rearward Looking Side Cameras with their 100m range and especially the lack of a rearward facing radar. I'm having doubts that this will suffice in ~~high~~ higher speed situations like our German Autobahn.
There are plenty situations where you need to look at a tiny dot in your mirror for a view moments to get a hold of how fast a car is approaching.
Where are not talking about high resolution information but the ability to estimate the speed of vehicles approaching from as far behind you 300-500 meter and maybe even more."
"After reading this article -- [Reuters: Tesla, rivals joust over how to put self-driving cars on the road](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-selfdriving-analysis-idUSKCN12K2ND) -- could someone explain how the 8 cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and the forward facing radar (along with onboard supercomputer) are superior to an equivalently powerful setup utilizing lidar? Is it the sonar equipment that makes up for, or possibly improves on, a lidar system? Or the radar? Or are the cameras better? A combination?

This is the main quote that caught my attention: 
""'Lidars are becoming very inexpensive, and they will always add an additional safety layer. So in these early days of self-driving, I wonder why anyone wouldn't want to use lidars for added safety,' said Sebastian Thrun, former head of Google's self-driving car project.""
 I am no expert on this topic, but it is confusing to me why Google, Ford, and possibly other companies are convinced lidar is imperative to the safety of autonomous vehicles, and Tesla has decided not to use them. I would really appreciate a technical explanation behind possible reasons behind this decision.

Side note: I have full confidence that Elon and the team know exactly what they are doing and have plenty of reasons behind their decision. I am also well-aware that Tesla > Ford in every way. I just need to know things sometimes. "
Im convinced Elon is an extra terrestrial here to help advance humans.
"The important implication for all of this: The first model 3 is highly likely to be fully autonomous. Congras to all of those who reserved early, probably get the car in a year or so. Tesla is saying those who reserve now may get the car in mid 2018. But if you keep dragging your feet, wait another month, your earliest chance probably will be in mid 2019. No other company can offer anything similar until 2023~2025. Tesla will be demand constrained for years."
tesla.com/autopilot - using metric units in the US. Maybe one day the general public will accept it as a better system.
Elon tweeted the 100% self-driving demo video:  https://www.tesla.com/videos/full-self-driving-hardware-all-teslas
"Video is pretty cool. Idk what I expected. It almost seems mundane to watch a human not touch a steering wheel. It was just ""yup, he didn't have to do shit, impressive."" It still deserves to become viral af. Expect your mothers talking about it in 3-5 days. 

Edit: Elon just tweeted: tap summon in your phone and your car will eventually find you, even across country. Can I get the time lapse in that?"
"Is this the ""surprise announcement""?"
"But, this does nothin to address why there is no speedometer screen still.  He said that it would be clear after the second reveal..."

"the video is online!

I can't even literally. 
"So what happens if after 2-3 years, they realize that the car cannot meet the requirement for self driving, without adding additional hardware?

Do we get a refund if they can't retrofit it?  Do we get a refund bigger than the purchase price of the feature, since we only bought the car because of the claim?

Sounds like a big class action lawsuit waiting to happen if they physically can't deliver.


"
Niiice
Awesome.
"Full autonomy = level 5, right? So the hardware will be level 5 capable, as the software and regulations evolve? 

Well then."
Direct link to blog: https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware
I'm never walking again. 
"This is great, but the real question is when will the software be ready?  It was nearly a year from the original AP hardware launch to activation.  I can easily see it being a couple years before level 3 autonomy is ready.  I'm curious what others think."
could this be whats powering it? .... http://www.nvidia.com/object/drive-px.html
"I ordered last friday and checked the $2500 autopilot feature...  Now it says enhanced autopilot is $5000 along with full self driving capability is $3000...  I wonder which one I am getting?
"
cost is over 10k CAD...........
"You will need to ""tell"" your car where to go.. or it takes you home!

""All you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go. If you don’t say anything, the car will look at your calendar and take you there as the assumed destination or just home if nothing is on the calendar. """
Future proof cars.... I wonder what the resale will be.   Have they come firmed battery upgrades? 
Does anybody have any advice for someone who *just* purchased and took delivery of a Model X or am I SOL?

"Fair points. But if there is a long delay for new customers until they even get on par with current auto pilot things will get pretty antsy. This could be another case of jump out of the plane and then figure out how to make the parachute. There will be some people inside tesla software development under enormous pressure right now. And pressure can lead to mistakes. 
"
A free Chauffeur for everyone!
Wow this is incredible and happening so fast now... This technology makes me wonder what else will be possible in just 3-5 years from today -- amazing time in human history!
"So anyone else see this here: https://i.imgur.com/LflPP5v.png

Under the Full Self Driving option:

> Please note also that using a self driving Tesla for car sharing and ride hailing for friends and family is fine, but doing so for revenue purposes will only be permissible on the Tesla Network, details of which will be released next year.


So Tesla will cut out the Uber middleman and make its own rideshare service? Awesome!"
"Next up, Uber buys thousands of Model 3s that allow them to offer autonomous rides for 1/2 of the price they currently charge."
any videos on the q&a?
Retrofit?
I really wish I could afford a Tesla.
"I wonder if this is all powered by NVIDIA. From the demos of Drive PX, we can see the whole environment mapped on the screen. I really hope they add this feature now that they have all these cameras. Beats the hell out of a surround view."
"I'm kind of curious about carjacking an autonomous car that's empty. Say your car is going to pick up an uber passenger and someone smashes the window and jumps in. I know you'd initially have a GPS reading on where the car is but would there also be some kind of automatic shutoff? Sending my $110,000 ""taxi"" out autonomously seems like it could be a pretty big risk. 

Also, will there be a way to look though the cameras remotely? "
Is it cheaper for them to include the hardware on every car then to just include it on special order? If people don't pay to unlock the software aren't they losing all the money they spend on the system? Or is it still cheaper to just include it on every care because of economics of scale?
"This really is new tech directly from the labs, not powerpointware https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/789004268296544256"
"""Should mention that retrofitting to full self-driving hardware is very difficult. Cost delta is more than buying a new car. Wish it weren't."" - https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/789007996038721536"
What happens if it cannot find a space? Does it just return home? that would be fun on a long road trip lol.
The video is up on the Autopilot page.
"Well, I just got a boner..."
"A german court just said Tesla needs to stop to advertise their cars with ""Autopilot"" because it's only an assistant. I guess now they have a totally new case :P"
Is there a transcript of the Q&A?
What determines the speed that it goes and changing lanes on the highway? Does it just go the speed limit?
And all this hardware and software is available from Nvidia. 
"Just going by this:

http://www.sae.org/misc/pdfs/automated_driving.pdf

I know that Elon said the *hardware* will be Level 5 - but any ideas on what the software/total package will be? Safe to assume completely Level 5 by next year when they do the NYC to LA demo?"
Just in time for me to save enough to buy one in 8-10 years
"So, that means city driving as well, stopping at lights and stop signs and what not? Crazy. "
"So from the sounds of this, I gather the following things:

1. I will be able to summon my car from a parking space to me at any time and also send it to park from anywhere? 

2. I will be able to set a destination on my map and the car will drive there based on my selected option (Fastest, shortest, etc).  I may also be able to set a multiple destination (think roadtrip) schedule and the car will follow it?

3. This will work outside of California and be allowed by local governments?  What will happen if it is used in a place that the government has not given the ok on?  What if there is no driver if an accident occurs (say during a summon or park is requested)?

4. How will all of this be controlled when outside of the car?  Phone app, key fob?

5.  This makes me even more excited for 2018 when I plan to, hopefully, get into a 3!  All the bugs should be worked out, improvements made, and everything ready to go by that time.

6. I need to make my POS ICE last 2 more years!"
"What are some the the implications of the autonomous feature on the design of the Model 3 interior? 

With a car where perhaps most will choose and use fully autonomous, Tesla could design the cockpit less with optimal vehicle control in mind and more of a leisure based approach. Ideas?"
"If you were to buy a new S or X today, would you pay for the full package today? What does the extra 3k give you the next 6 months, or even the first year? I imagine it will take time to be able to use autonomous features. "
How will new autopilot handle 2 way roads that only have enough space for one car to pass at the time? (one of the cars must stop at the side of road to let other pass) 
"This data collection required to get the software up and running...do we know anything about what they are collecting? I was thinking about that yesterday as I drove though a weird intersection in Atlanta. It would be hard to teach software to ID all of the signs and signals needed to drive through a complicated intersection.
 
A shortcut to being able to navigate problem areas would be to put down markers after a number of human driven cars made it through a difficult street or intersection.  Do we know if that is the kind of data collected? "
"I think I'm a bit confused. Every Tesla will be equipped with 8 cameras, 12 sonars, 1 radar, and the onboard computer. All of these sensors will always be passively running.
However without the Enhanced Autopilot (non enhanced Version not an option?) none of these sensors can actively be used in any user facing feature. What about rearward looking camera for parking or the radar for emergency braking?


With the Enhanced Autopilot the radar, 4 of the cameras (I guess the two Rearward Looking Side Cameras, Wide Forward & Main Forward Camera) plus all of the 12 sonars will be used for what is essentially a very advanced driver assist system.


Full Self-Driving Capability will activate the remaining 4 cameras and enable Self-Driving once the software is ready. Will those 4 additional cameras then be utilized for the Enhanced Autopilot as well?

All of this hardware is always installed right away or is there anything that has to be retrofitted when you do an upgrade after delivery?"
So are we guessing like 2017? I'll probably wait until the feature set is enabled to purchase.
Is it just me or did it appear that the right reer wheel was about to hit the gutter in the reverse park before they cut away to the interior of the cabin...?
"OK, I'm sadly completely confused.  It's great that they have the technology for fully autonomous driving, but clearly there are tons of regulatory and software hurdles to overcome before this technology is ready for prime time.  I love the idea of installing the hardware first and gathering tons of data from that to perfect the software in the future.

So I guess my question is that as of today, what are you getting when you select the $3000 autonomous driving option?  Is this essentially some kickstarter style funding for the software development tacked onto a car purchase?  Why not gather the data, then present it as a purchase option on compatible vehicles once technical and regulatory hurdles have been cleared?"
I just came in my pants.
Is there a live stream? I can't find one.
Welp... there's goes the last vestige of any thoughts I had about buying a Bolt.
They're going to destroy the automotive market competition of this works out.
Talk about shipping before it's done... jeez.. TACC and autosteer not available on cars leaving the production line now?
announcement includes LA-NY demo drive date!
"Full autonomy is one of those things I won't believe until I see it.  Autopilot is believable, full autonomy is unbelievable "
"Will post video of a Tesla navigating a complex urban environment shortly. That was what took the extra couple of days.
-Elon"
I'm a little worried about redundancy. They mention the cameras have some redundancy but what about other parts of thr system? What if the computer shorts out during a drive? Wouldn't you need a backup computer in order to not die in that situation? 
"So if you cruise on over to the design studio, you can see that [superchargers will be getting autocharge capability!](https://twitter.com/teslatidbits/status/788906586676850689)"

"This is amazing but I'm very disappointed they misspelled ""emergency braking"" on the official Tesla site. That is my biggest grammar-nazi pet peeve. It's weird that younger people seem to think there is some connection between the words braking and breaking."
"I love the hardware news, but I have to call out Tesla for the pricing strategy.
  
If you want the full autonomy, you have to pay $8k right now ($5k for autopilot, plus $3k for the self-driving special sauce) with no real guarantee that the self-driving will ever work (I have faith, but let's be real - this isn't easy!), or be legal where you drive.  What if it is banned in your state after the AP is involved in a fatal accident?  I fully believe that AP will be safer than humans, but poop happens in the real world, and humans are notorious for overreacting.  I'm not knocking Tesla, but I'm pessimistic about the mob mentality after a tragic accident, even if it represents a great overall reduction in vehicular fatalities.
  
Ok, you say, ""don't buy it now, and just turn it on later.""  Sure, that's great, but it costs you $2000 more to do it later!  That seems pretty unfair to me, especially given that the hardware is obviously in the car.  I think the better move would be to waive the surcharge for anyone that buys now and wants AP enabled once Tesla has shown it works."
"Right on time. If everything goes right in the stock market, I'll have a Model S by late next year."
Why did this announcement need refining?
how was this announced? is there a stream?
"The first think I thought of when I saw ""neural net"". We're going to be driving a terminator!

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HUp4tRmfyWs"
HOLY SHIT!!!!
Think Apple had some insider information on Tesla and that's why they decided to pull out on making a car?  Their whole plan was going to be full autonomy... without being first on that front what's the point?
"ok, since no one is posting the link... http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/19/13341194/tesla-autopilot-shadow-mode-autonomous-regulations"
"I'm curious to know which aspects of the new system have redundant hardware.  I don't think you can honestly claim level 5 autonomy without redundant computers, power supplies, sensors, etc.  The only specific I've seen so far is that they have redundant cameras for the ""self driving"" package.  What about the rest of the stack?"
Feeling validated in my decision to lease.
"A friend of mine ordered a Tesla recently and mentioned that even though each car comes with the required hardware for autopilot, activating the technology is still an expensive optional extra. Is this the case?"
"It should be remembered that this will be great for individual car driver/the old, etc.  But the number 1 job in the U.S. by number of those employed is ""Truck driver""  The robots are coming for your jobs and this is going to have profound impact on our society.  Some say good, some say bad.  It will be very disruptive.  "
Is the codename for this JARVIS?
I wonder if the non-availability of ap for new cars is a protection for the company against regulatory action against existing cars with ap.
I predicted this in a post a while back and got down voted to pieces.  Oh well.  Is anyone else refreshing Elon's Twitter feed every three seconds?  Bring on the video!
I can't wait to have sex in a self-driving taxi. Please excuse the smell. 
I wonder how Autopilot 2.0 performs on icy roads.
"Perhaps the reason we haven't seen a nice steering wheel and interior setup for the model 3 is that it won't have a steering wheel at all. I know it's crazy, but Elon has big dreams. "

Interesting Fred seems to have beaten Tesla... still don't see it on the blog site...
"Wow....that's awesome!! I wished they did a live stream event, but I guess it's not necessary."
"So, what level of autonomy are we talking here??  This is insane!!!!  So glad I got on line that day!"
NOICE!!!!
THIS IS WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR WHEN I PRE-ORDERED. YES!!!!
This is nuts 
"It says all production vehicles from here on out will have full autonomy hardware, but it doesn't mention if we still need to pay to enable it. I'm guessing it's still an option that you will have to buy?"
"Should be interesting to see how autonomous develops between the lidar and non-lidar camps.  Can anyone knowledgeable explain why the solid-state lidar that's (becoming?) available, and what seems to be what any other camps are doing, is the 'wrong' path?  or is it just that lidar will be the right choice further down the road and radar+cameras are a better choice in the shorter term?

Regardless, now to see how the Model S sales start to spike as people can now start buying cars that will be fully autonomous once the right OTA update is pushed out :D"
"As awesome as this is, I don't think this was much of a surprise to anyone as a part of their long term goal.  I don't think we're any closer to knowing *when* autonomy will be available at all unless it comes up on the conference call, and those tend not to give out dates or definitive answers to much of anything.

Who would be responsible for an accident if no one is officially driving?  :-(  I was hoping for HUD 
"""A forward-facing radar with enhanced processing provides additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength, capable of seeing through heavy rain, fog, dust and even the car ahead.""

I've seen reports that the full self-driving price will be $8K. Can anyone confirm?
so will there be snakes on super charger stations?
"""Can I take your order?""
""Uh yeh, 2 rum and cokes, a vodka soda, and a pint of Guinness please""
""Sure, drive thru to first window please"""
This is bonkers. 
Anyone have link to video in urban environment AP? Elon said he was working on that last few days.
What hardware will the Model 3 have if you don't spend the $8K?  Will it still support the Model X's equivalent of autopilot and just not be fully autonomous?
Any mention of how much it is going to cost cars that are ordered but not into production yet to enable these features?
"This could be license to print money in the long term for Tesla. Unlocking the self drive features as they are rolled out and updated will no doubt cost money. And who wont want them! I guess it costs a lot to develop this stuff but it's pretty cool and puts them miles ahead of the competition. 
Big question marks though is will the Tesla developed software be any good? How much has severing ties with Mobile Eye set them back? When will the new cars be up to speed with driver assistance with existing cars?  These are big questions anyone have answers?"
"Do you think that when Elon said this was the model 3 part 2, a term he used to answer a question why there was no binnacle, he meant to say that full autonomous driving is the reason that there will be no binnacle? Also does this mean there wont be a HUD as most of us have speculated? "
"When looking at the configurator now, there are two options for the enhanced autopilot with different hardware and seemingly capabilities. Are both options the ""hardware needed for full self-driving capability?"""

"Can't wait to work for Tesla in a few years, will be the 1st in my family to have never bought a gasoline car."
I wonder how long it will be between buying one of the new cars and having access to the features that the cars currently have.
"Wait... so the Model S I get in December won't be able to use what is currently marketed as Autopilot at all? Seriously? 

I'm all for progress, but let me opt in to something please. "
"Awesome. But can someone explain to me what this part means?

>Before activating the features enabled by the new hardware, we will further calibrate the system using millions of miles of real-world driving to ensure significant improvements to safety and convenience. While this is occurring, Teslas with new hardware will temporarily lack certain features currently available on Teslas with first-generation Autopilot hardware, including some standard safety features such as automatic emergency breaking, collision warning, lane holding and active cruise control.

Uh, there's no time given for how long this takes. Does this mean new Teslas with the upgraded hardware won't have many basic auto pilot features that are currently available? And it doesn't even mention how long they might be out...isn't that weird not to mention? I don't own a Tesla, but wouldn't people interested in buying Teslas be clamoring to get this information? And wouldn't Tesla realize that and at least want to mention a potential time table?"
The hype train has left the fucking station kids! Choo choo!
"So this means that over time, maybe a year or 2, all new Teslas will have Level 4.0 Autopilot?

It seems premature, especially the bad press they get with every minor incident that occurs, but I guess that means that they've thoroughly tested their software already and know that it is on the level that it needs to be, and just needs the refinement which it will get from additional mileage data - which they should get quickly, and be able to handle given that they've already worked with huge amounts of data"
The future is now. I want one of these cars

"This is seriously, fucking amazing.  I love to think that I'm alive in times like these."
So crazy question? But where the heck can I watch the announcement video?? I've e looked everywhere! I had class during the livestream so I wasn't able to watch live. 😞
"If a cop pulls over one of these cars, can the owner blame the car for a moving violation since they weren't operating it?"
"So you get the new hardware, but lose features (in the short term) with the promise of more autonomy (in the long term). As a Model 3 reservation holder, this is good.

Would this include a Model S someone locked in to buy one week ago? Delivery late december/early next year"
"On a side note, hopefully much faster navigation and general screen responsiveness for all new cars!"
Sorry if this was asked but I tried to search a few key words and didn't find anything.  Has Musk said how this will affect the range the vehicles can go after using that extra processing power ?
I was hoping for more info on model 3.... It getting full autonomy is great but I want to see final design !
"Here's what always fascinates me:

The people most critical of (and expecting perfection from) Tesla and their driving automation plans always seem to be the technical/IT communities.  Slashdot, for example, can't post a Tesla Autopilot story without half of the posts painting a picture of some corner-of-a-corner-of-a-corner case where the technology will fail.  On the contrary I would expect the technical/IT communities to be the ones to recognize that the initial performance bar doesn't need to be ""perfection"" but rather ""as good as a human"" which statistically is a long, long way from perfection.  Once we're at that point, all improvements in the solution represent a net positive improvement in safety as compared to the status quo. 

I for one applaud Tesla for making inroads in this space, and welcome similar innovations fron anyone else."
A maxed out Telsa and a BMW M6 are my dream cars
"Doesn't this whole development contradict to what Elon was very supportive about a couple of months ago, that radar is waaay better than cameras? How come they decided to go with 8 cameras in this second iteration of autonomy hardware? Such Elon's comments were made around the time Tesla split up with MobilEye."
My MX just arrived this month. Will an after-market upgrade be possible?
"I have speculative questions!

- Does this mean that we're done improving/updating Autopilot 1.0, or will some of the lessons learned in 2.0 be applicable to the old equipment?

- Will AP 2.0 be able to make use of AP 1.0 fleet learning data, or is AP 1.0 too coarse to be that useful?

- This seems to leapfrog recent developments by Mercedes, Volvo and others who were just catching up to AP 1.0. Any thoughts on what they'll do? (Aside from regulatory lobbying to kill the product before it's fully realized, of course. That's a standard tactic these days.)

- Does this kill the Bolt? $37k for a Bolt vs. $43k for a Model 3 that can do this seems like no decision at all. 

- With the car being able to run around without me, possibly parking far away or even going home while I'm out and about, will range become a renewed issue/focus? For example: My work parking lot gets congested. I could let Tesla find a parking space or I could just send it home and have it come back and get me later. But that means extra round trips which means extra range impact. It also makes the high-amperage charging hardware more desirable and makes me wonder how we're going to charge this beast at the supercharger and at home without human intervention.

- If you think supercharger abuse is bad now, wait until people can send their car to the local supercharger to top off any time they want. The good news is that people won't be parked in supercharger spots when they're done charging, but use will go up. There's no reason *not* to have it run to the SC while you're shopping, dining or working. Bonus: You can have it run to the supercharger at 4 in the morning while you're still sleeping, then pick you up at your front door when you're ready to go to work. 

- Other side of the coin: Do we care quite as much about performance if we're not driving it?   

- At a time when the baby boomers are getting older and some are less fit to drive, this could be a big help for senior mobility and road safety. That's an issue here in Florida that I'm happy to solve with technology. Imagine if an assisted living facility could buy an autonomous Model X to ferry residents to where they want to go so they don't have to feel like shut-ins. 

- Anecdotally, the Tesla offices are rather famous for their parking congestion. It seems like they've found a solution. "
Legit question: was the demonstration video technically breaking the law by letting the car self-drive despite regulations not being in place about autonomous driving?
"How many GPU cores are in the NVIDIA Titan  in Tesla Hardware2 that delivers 12 TFLOPS?  2688 cores?  Lookin' good, been meaning to write some CUDA and OpenCL code."
"So uhh, how about a mirror of the Q&A? The only video I've seen is private now :("
"> Please note also that using a self-driving Tesla for car sharing and ride hailing for friends and family is fine, but doing so for revenue purposes will only be permissible on the Tesla Network, details of which will be released next year.

That's a shame, seems a pretty anticompetitive move unless there's some technical or legal reason for it"
"But you need to pay for it if you want it starting now, so the title means ""You have the ability to purchase a fully autonomous tesla starting now.""?? Right?"
Will AP 2.0 work at night time? 
"So, enhanced autopilot and self-driving capabilities are now separate line items when you build a Tesla.

What about those of us that already have vehicles in production (post Oct 10)? Do we have to pay the $4K to enable self-driving later, or is it considered gratis?"
Can someone tell me if tesla ditched bosch in moving entirely to NVIDIA Drive PX2 platform? I am referring to this link https://electrek.co/2016/09/06/tesla-autopilot-2-0-glimpse-bosch-model-s-prototype-video/

"Went to test drive the X today. Couldn't close the deal because even lane departure wasn't available yet. The wife said "" you want us to pluck down $120k right now for tech we can't even tryout?""  I heard so much about all this driving assistance stuff on the Tesla. I thought it was all there already. 

Volvo, Range Rover, etc have lane assist and breaking etc. even GMC for Christ's sake. Totally blew a sale today and now I have to live with a Range Rover for the next three years. 🙄

I loved the X.  Totally loved it. But the wife just didn't dig it like I did. "
"Just so we are clear, NO other car company currently has or has announced an all electric vehicle for under 35K with full autonomy.  Even the Chevy BOLT is 35K after incentives and rebates.   "
I'm Confused. I'm picking up my model x this Saturday. Will it have these features or not?
"This is great, but I was really hoping we'd also get a fancy HUD"
"To be honest i dont know if the forward looking capabilities are really enough.  If you assume the vehicle has a zero reaction time according to this 
http://www.csgnetwork.com/stopdistinfo.html there may be some pretty hard breaking if there is an object lying in the road. Especially in areas with 85 mph speed limits

"I don't know if this was already known but they are saying you cannot use a Tesla for ride sharing outside of the Tesla Network (uber competitor) they are developing.

Not sure I agree with that part.  It's your car - you should be able to rent it out however you want to."
How much for a P100D outfitted with this? 
"My how long were they producing the Teslas with the old autopilot hardware before they actually turned on autopilot? This could possibly give us a minimum time estimate for how long self driving will take, tho it'll probably take quite a bit longer."
"Only forward facing radar? For merging into the flow of traffic on the road, specially on highways you need to detect fast approaching cars. 360 vision should be augmented with 360 radar for full reliable level 4 autonomy."
Can anyone comment on how the new hardware compares to what's in a googles driverless vehicle?
looks like you can't update.
"Soo 2 things...

1) I was actually expecting a bit more info :/ like i really wanted to see an announcement about how the interior will look like... I guess we take what we can get.

2) Does this means that Autonomy Hardware is not a upgrade anymore? AFAIK that was a paid for UG right?
"
"Can someone explain how this is different from AP 2.0?  I thought Tesla just released 2.0 a few months ago, but it seems like people are making a big deal about this newest release.  I guess a table comparing AP1.0, AP2.0, and today's announcement would be very helpful in understanding what is going on.

"1 hour has passed, do we know when will Q&A start?"
"I'm curious what everyone's take is on this hypothetical. Let's say you pay for full autonomy, but your country/state etc bans it for a few years. Is tesla going to refund you that portion? Seems like such a risk to pay for that upfront when you dont even know if you can use it."
So I just spent 100k on a model x that I picked up 2 weeks ago. Do I get these new features?
I'll withhold judgement until I see one go from one end of the Autobahn to the other with no issues 
I wonder how much can a 70D model S with 8000 miles sell right now. (4 months old)
This is great news. We should get every old person that can barely see but still wants to drive and put them behind the wheel of a self driving car. Solves the problem of people complaining about old people that should not have licenses still and hey old people would still think they're driving; just like handing a younger sibling a Xbox controller so they think they're actually playing the game.

I wonder if this is included (as in 'activated') as standard in the Model 3... because that could be a real dealbreaker if people can get a self-driving car for $35k...
"Basically want to note that when you are buying a car (new custom build) that it has few ""automatic"" features as of right now (even the most basic features), but will occur with a software update. So those who are current owners take comfort in the following:

- AP 1.0 is still amazing and best out on the road right now
- AP 1.0 still relieves your stress
- AP 1.0 is significantly cheaper
- New Inventory Tesla's still provide the best value, even more so now that the 2 year lease is back and the fact that getting your hands on a Tesla is more attainable in this fashion
- While the technology is there for self-driving and even when it is activated-- say next year. I guarantee that the law will take 3x as long to catch up at a minimum. Don't believe it? Try autopilot in stop and go and take out your phone-- you'll get a ticket. So it begs the question (for those who are slightly more sensible-- does it make sense to have buyers remorse-- nope not at all)."
I can't wait for self-driving cars to reach critical mass so bikes and scooters can take over the roads.

Is anyone contemplating buying a Model S seriously considering paying for the Self-Driving Capability upfront? Vaporware is a legitimate concern which I think outweighs the additional $500 they're charging to flip the switch after delivery compared to AP 1.0.
No retrofit on older vehicles??
"Google maps must hide my face; does Tesla do so as well, or will all tells cars become roving cameras with endless memories of people at places for future references?"

">While this is occurring, Teslas with new hardware will temporarily lack certain features currently available on Teslas with first-generation Autopilot hardware, including some standard safety features such as automatic emergency breaking, collision warning, lane holding and active cruise control.

Good to have the hardware in place, but they still haven't even reached parity with Mobileye."
"Well the good news is that my model 3 will be level five. The bad news is that the car I bought last month won't have it. I got the car for the same price as I would have ordered it for, but with more features because it was a showroom model. "
Interestingly when I try to play around with the 3D models of the car on the design studio it crashes and gives me an error. Once they fix this hopefully we get to see where the cameras are placed around the car!

"> System will always be operating in shadow mode to demonstrate to regulators when computer would or wouldn't have acted in accidents

That's interesting. Literally, that means that there will be possibly fatal accidents, and Tesla will collect this data, and tell regulators that the car would have braked here and turned here, and thus avoided the accident... and they will then have to accumulate enough of this data until it is statistically significant"

That's good, but it's only a part of the equation.  The regulators will also need/want to know how often Tesla's algorithm would have caused an accident but the human at the controls successfully avoided it.  This will be more difficult to measure.  Did the press conference cover this point?"

">* System will always be operating in shadow mode to demonstrate to regulators when computer would or wouldn't have acted in accidents

This is such a smart move. It sets the stage for headlines like ""Driver Dies in Fatal Crash that Car Could Have Prevented"". It will place pressure on regulators to approve the new technologies. Nobody wants to be the senator in that article trying to explain why consumers can't have this life-saving technology. "

"Tesla, the Apple of car companies, getting people to buy the same shit again and again, just faster, better, more shiny than 6 mos ago.  I like driving my car, except in traffic.

What happens when it becomes a true autopilot???
"I'm still skeptical about full level 5 on the new/current hardware. 4 maybe. But by the time we pass all the legal hurdles (5-10+ years), we'll have *even more* advanced hardware available, so I'm guessing the first cars to offer true level 5 will be a newer model year. 

Once the law specifies autodrive needs to be capable of at least 1000x safer than a human, Tesla's current hardware capping out at ""only"" like 10x safer won't be up to snuff."

Don't change your presentation. Tesla does not have level 4 or 5 autonomy. All they have is a grand promise from a guy who doesn't write software. Write a report about level 4 or 5 after they actually demonstrate it.

And any job associated with driving a vehicle. 
Why do you think the car industry will disappear?
I believe this is known as an autonomous mic drop.

[Tesla is already gearing up](http://i.imgur.com/Sp2H51U.jpg)
Super excited for mine now. 
I took delivery last week so I won't get it at all :(
"Seems like when they cut their relationship with Mobileye they had to give up some auto driving features till their in-house solution catches up. Instead of announcing that new owners are losing features, Tesla is announcing that they get better hardware."
"I'm personally in a pretty good spot, if I were to trade up, I'd go from none of these features to whatever's enabled now then to whatever they add in the future"
Short term for those of us who paid for 1st gen hardware turned out to be nearly a year. Imagine getting your brand new X next week but have no autopilot nor emergency braking for the next year. 
"If it's neural network based algorithms for autonomy, they might not be able to confidently gather data for training without the new hardware in the wild."
I think this would be most concerning for lease holders. Imagine you just did a 2 year lease. You take delivery next month and potentially half of your time you don't have even basic Autopilot or safety features.
To the contrary I would have much preferred this to receiving the AP1  Model X I currently have. AP1 doesn't work nearly well enough for me so having AP turned off while AP2 is made usable would be no loss really.
"No, you wouldn't be annoyed."
Damn those things were expensive
There's a 30 day return period right?! Right?!? Sigh...
Hey it's me ur brother
The first burn is the worst :/
How could it be so expensive?!
"Feel good about your purchase. You drive a f*****ing spaceship. In a few years, if you want, you can upgrade and I'm sure your magical space bus will still have solid resale value. "
"Agreed - kind of hurts. The larger price tag on new AP helps a little, but not much."
"Right there with you. I can't think of another vehicle model in history that obsoletes itself within the first model year, and only maybe five months after production has hit full swing."
I'm in the same boat but picked mine up two weeks ago. I still feel like it's a little early to tell what this means though. It's possible these cars May not see additional benefits over ours for years and years to come. Right now it's just too early to know. I would have had to pay at least $8k more for abilities that are unseen and unfinished with no completion date. So it's not a clear cut feeling as it first seemed.
Yep. Got mine in July. Now it sucks. 
"Lol

"> $150,000 Palm Pilot

I beg your pardon."
There has been speculation of retrofit option.
That is what I was thinking. I wanted to see the final controls/interior
It's been hypothesized that the Model 3 is going to have advanced autopilot features - and it just got officially announced.
"Yeah I'm a little confused myself. I figured the part 2 unveil would have more info about the Model 3 (pricing, options, other features etc), but then I also figured part 2 would come when the Model 3 was closer to production.

AP 2.0 sounds great, but as some one who loves to drive, it's not the feature I'm most excited for."
"There's gonna be a part 3 though

No. this was just relating to Model 3 
"Yes, https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/788823067392749568"
I'm thinking there is going to be a part 3 with the final spec car sometime in the early spring when they start to make the validation units.

Wouldn't Uber just rent their own Teslas? Why pay you?
Except for the fact that Uber doesn't need you anymore as soon as self driving cars hit the road. 
I'm waiting for the first self-driving RVs.
"Strangely enough, they've already said that this won't be allowed unless you are doing ride-sharing through their own Tesla network, not Uber."
"This won't last for long though. Uber is making their own self-driving cars and they will eventually replace their human drivers with autopilot cars (so they don't have to pay human drivers anymore). 

edit: and Tesla may not allow self-driving autopilot to be used with Uber"
Time to invest in public showers.
"you'll start to get bad uber ratings from the smell.

get a hotel with a shower you bum!

;)"
"The hardware is there, but you are probably going to have to pay to enable it."
"The thing is the new hardware will be sufficient to enable full autonomy in the future, when the software is ready as well. Now the challenge is to make the software significantly better than human drivers and fully autonomous in every conceivable situation. This means the cars that now get produced are future proof, but we are still going to have for the future (autonomous driving) for a while."
"I think this means the hardware is technically capable of full autonomy, but full autonomy is something that still isn't ready and needs to be perfected and will happen gradually over time using OTAs. Right now, the new cars will have the needed HW but the SW will be little behind compared to the original AP, but it will quickly catch up and eventually exceed the capabilities of current AP, and then reach full autonomy levels."
"wow! a few thoughts: 
* it seems to be that long-awaited Nvidia partnership is finally happening: http://www.nvidia.com/object/drive-px.html along with Tesla's own radar hacks & tweaks... nice!
* also, I love how they're relentlessly pushing the envelope! all these developments have barely 'landed' with most people and bang...another leap forward. what an insane innovation pace, most automakers would milk the crap out of even the first iteration of autopilot for another decade. but not Tesla. nope.
* still no explanation on the missing instrument panel on the 3 (as we were promised via Elon's very own tweets connecting the 'part deux' reveal with this announcement)
* looking forward to the presser details!"
it *will be.*
This is just hype
highly unlikely.
"Fully autonomous Bolts should be [in production by the end of next year,](http://www.autoblog.com/2016/05/05/gm-lyft-autonomous-chevy-bolt-next-year/) before the 3 will even available.  Autonomous Bolt test cars have been on the streets since [May in San Francisco and August in Scottsdale.](http://mashable.com/2016/08/09/cruise-automation-chevy-bolt-ev-scottsdale/#mtwvzjbghGqF)"
"The Bolt doesn't even come with dynamic cruise control. For a supposed commuter car, that's a pretty important feature to leave out."
They all buy from NVIDIA anyways.
We knew that when GM announced the Bolt. Look how terrible and idea and rollout the Volt was...
But a hell of a lot cheaper...
But it's cheaper with incentives than the Model 3 without them!

"Yesss. This is the one we expected, closer to production."
"Arg, announced with no eta. Wah!"
that is an excellent point. parking garages with superchargers in it.
"Remember that super charging isn't included in the standard price. And using a super charger every night to refill 50 miles of range isn't great for the battery, so you would likely send it off every few days , once it's getting low, which will intensify range anxiety. We really just need apartments to install more and more accessible chargers... It's the next ""mandatory"" utility."
No more grandpa backing into the garage wall again.
"Not until we have level 5 enabled. If you can't drive solo, you shouldn't drive a non L5 car as a crutch. If you should ever find yourself in a scenario where your car requires you to intervene due to it not being full L5 functionality, you should be in the full capacity to do so."
That's what I'm hoping for!!
That is correct. You won't even have collision avoidance and automatic emergency braking until around December. 
Sucker!  Oh wait...
Well by the time this is all activated it might be 3-5 year old Tesla.

Not true unfortunately. It will be a year or two at least before we get 'drive me home from the bar'  level. 
That is just what Autopilot 1.0 is though...
HUD HUD HUD! 
Great!  I was wondering how that was supposed to explain the interior...
[deleted]
That's what the cameras are for. Humans rely on sight to make that judgement. The car has sight + ultrasound (at twice the range now). 
"I assume the answer is here in the announcement. ""Eight surround cameras provide 360 degree visibility around the car at up to 250 meters of range"". Radar for front. Camera for rear

"
One or more of the 8 cameras they're using for surround vision?
"The first word though my mind was, ""autobahn?""

The vehicles will have relative speed differences exceeding 100km/h. Here's hoping the surround vision is enough to keep safe in that environment!"
"I'm with you on this. The scenario that immediately jumped into my head was when you're on a side street wanting to pull onto a highway with ~60 mph speed limits. When I'm in that situation, I'm looking more than 250 meters away to see oncoming traffic..."
360 degree cameras?
https://www.tesla.com/autopilot?redirect=no
I think they will need rear facing radars as for lane changing in poor conditions the cameras will not see a fast approaching car in that lane. They would need two though one for left and one for right lane changes. The other thing they could do is continuously monitor the vision from cameras to radar and turn off some features on poor visibility.
Yessssss please!
Not seen on Tesla.com....
"Not really, it's still years away."
Still an awesome car that will grow into a self driving one.
I can imagine the car leaving you to one spot in a crowded city and parks itself where it can find a parking place.
The rules for pimping out my Tesla better be pretty stringent. I don't want random high-school kids with mommy's credit card getting in my car. Hopefully strict user access and review ratings will keep people's cars from looking like the back of a cab in PHX. 
That's not slimy at all...
i think i see a special eye glasses in rear view mirror
For a while at least.
There isn't one. It's just the blog post and the Q&A with press.
But then overnight they will be the same or better :)
Tesla will now be running their own software in the background and comparing it to actual driver behavior. This helps them refine the software and have some measure of performance. 
Not worse just fewer features. But will be better long run
Demo video was the reason for the delay 
Yeah I don't understand why they have to delay a blog post by 2 days. I was expecting a demo of some new features at least. A bit disappointed. 
Early adopters are always going to lose out a little bit. So its not really an issue.
"They claim they have the hardware, but not yet the software. That's still at least a year away, probably more."
"We always had the tech for self-driving cars. But the main difficulty is making the software intelligent enough and that is something that will slowly roll out to the public. But you are correct, today is very significant. "
"We've had the tech for a while.  Mercedes has been running fully self-driving S-class prototypes for years now, you can even see onboard videos from journalists.  The issue is and always has been getting the system to adapt to random shit that happens in the real world.  You or I can adapt fairly well to random issues, computers aren't so good at that."
"LIDAR will still have its uses, just probably not in autonomous vehicles."
This is essentially that. We're already almost there
I'm guessing a good two years of data and tweaking before its technically capable of you going to sleep. Then laws. 
"If production were to remain flat which is unlikely they will produce at least 25,000 cars next quarter. If each of those cars drives 120 miles on autopilot then you will have reached 3 million miles. The more difficult goal is 1 billion miles which is when Elon said it would be ok to remove the beta designation."
Agreed autopilot 2 is not a new product it's a new feature 
who said it was part 2? 
It has been in testing for over a year according to Elon on the call.
"Elon uniquely uses a time-measurement system based on the Martian calendar. A Martian year has 687 days, and other units and phrases are scaled to match.

(Seriously, he's never been one for meeting his own expectations. The promised goals are usually met, but never the deadlines.)"
"very likely. I imagine they can leverage the data gathered to get regulatory help. ""Hey, look, the data says you have traffic jams here"" ""this says you need some road work""

lots of good things for this."
"Hope you made it out with major injuries. 

Edit. WithOUT!  Oh my goodness. Horrible typo. "
Happy cake day :)
"Code and model inspection.  Cars must have their software inspected once a year (by people who don't know what they are doing).  This will devolve into a pointless and semiarbitrary exercise where the data model used must be validated by bureaucrats with law degrees instead of people who can code and know math.

If they aren't, they can be fined.

Of course, they could just be prevented from leaving the inspection facilities if they fail and they could be grounded the next time the driver leaves the car if they are past their inspection date -- but that won't give jobs for cops or fines for the coffers."
"Good point on the cop revenue. Eventually it will affect their budgets, but we're  many years away from that."
So with a 36 month lease it'll expire close to when AP is ready for full autonomous driving. Nice timing.
"knowing elon, the ""shortly"" meant next week haha"
One thing they have done with 8.0 is essentially encrypted down the fireware meaning a third party can't tamper with the version. Only Tesla can. This is a pretty big deal. Its now almost impossible to upload your own firmware to the car.
"I'm not too worried about hacking into the autopilot, as it would almost certainly have to be per car, and I'm not someone who anyone has any reason to kill.  If (hopefully when) the President has a Tesla, these features would probably turned off/removed to completely prevent the hack possibility.

However, the ""easy"" way to hack autopilot that I am worried about is the fleet learning. (not to get into too much more detail.)"
Elon said the Tesla Vision computer that directly interfaces with the drivetrain itself is completely separate from the infotainment computer. So that takes the usual infotainment hacks out of the question.
"Isn't this the same as saying ""not for commercial use""?"
"+1.  I own it, he can suck it if he thinks he can tell me what my car can and can not legally do."
I just want an autonomous crypto-currency enabled car I can whore out while I'm at work
I'm sure you can do whatever you like with the actual car you just can't use Tesla's super expensive and complex self driving software to make money without using their system.
"You have the right to use the hardware you bought. But you're not buying the autopilot software. You're buying a license to use the autopilot software.

This isn't going to get shut down by the legal system."
8 cameras and a new computer? That's a lot of holes and new wiring to install. My guess is 100% impractical.
Probably not possible
not
Unknown for sure.
Elon confirmed that retrofitting is not possible for any current AP models on the media call.
"All the people screaming ""just a blog post?!"" are missing the hidden tidbits of info like this. Autonomous Superchargers? Tesla Network confirmed? This is huge!"
"I imagine that Tesla Network == Uber/Lyft ride request and vehicle provisioning. Uber is in trouble.

edit: From tesla.com ""Please note also that using a self-driving Tesla for car sharing and ride hailing for friends and family is fine, but doing so for revenue purposes will only be permissible on the Tesla Network, details of which will be released next year.""

Yea, I think I am right here."
Problem with multiple radars facing a similar direction is that they can interfere with each other. Radar wave emitted by one sensor can be picked up by another. 
https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware
"""but that doesnt mean they can measure a car speed right?"" 

Probably more accurately than humans currently do."
"They could measure car speed, as long as it's visible. If it's occluded by other cars it might be a concern. Presumably some of the cameras will have side mirror like views, so at worst it will be as bad as humans typically are, at best perhaps a bit better (because it's look in all directions at once). This might mean it will make a bad lane change, but so would have a human.

Still, rear-facing and wide range radar would be nice to allow it to see past those cars further to verify safety of lane change."
or what if a bug splatters on the camera?
It's still up for me
The Nvidia PX-2 costs $10k. Also there is no official word they are using them.
For some reason it is private. Douche move.
"Yes, for those of living where it gets snowy and icy, this is a big question that needs answering."
video on the way. elon tweeted that a bit ago.
"If this makes you feel better:

You still have autopilot 1.0, which will be the better than anyone's 2.0 car through at least the end of this year (longer if Elon's being too optimistic). And you paid thousands less for it then people will for 2.0.

Plus, there's simply no time to buy a Tesla that gives you much of a future-proof car. For instance, autopilot 1.0 h/w was on cars starting Sep '14, but wasn't enabled by OTA update until Oct '15. So at best, you could have timed your purchase to use autopilot 1.0 for about one year before 2.0 went into production (i.e. buy Model S in Oct '15). Basically smartphone like release cycle :-)"
"The old saying is still true... Buy on rumors, sell on news. "
"You only think you can see 300-500 meters behind you because your rear view mirror is convex, which makes things look much further away than they really are.  100m is plenty of distance for a computer to determine the speed of cars approaching with a 125mph delta, which is better than a human being.  Maybe Tesla will require the vehicle to be traveling at a certain minimum speed while on the unregulated portions of the autobahn."
You have the side view rear cameras which have a lot more range. 
"LIDAR uses the visible spectrum (Lasers). What that means is that technically what a camera can't see a LIDAR can't see and vice versa. All you need is superior vision processing and you make up for lack of LIDAR. With deep neural networks, cameras are the way forward. Radar is used to see ahead, especially during fast moving traffic on a highway where viability is poor. "
All LIDARs I've seen this far are those ugly big spinning cylinder on top of the car. I can think of a view reasons why Tesla doesn't want those ;) CV is one of them.
[Relevant.](http://gizmodo.com/evidence-that-elon-musk-is-an-alien-1780130528)
I think the public knows metric is better than imperial. They just don't think it's worth the effort and the financial cost from moving to metric.

"I love the idea that the car would stop at nothing to find you. Like if you were on the other side of the world it might book all sorts of ferries and cargo ships just to get itself to you. I know that's not the case, but I love the idea of the car striving to find you."

Most underwhelming announcement ever!  The hype train has crashed.
"I think the point is support for fully-autonomous driving, but it doesn't make perfect sense because it's apparently $8k worth of options on the Model S."
The model 3 has a speedometer. Its in the upper left corner of the center screen.
"Especially you DVP, especially you..."
Yes this is exactly what Tesla is hoping. It was in the Master Plan from earlier this year. 
Very unlikely they have regulatory approval for driverless mobility services in 2017.
"It likely won't happen in 2017.  It is likely that Tesla will announce/ release the service, but not start operating it ""pending new laws."""
"Well I'm pretty sure they already have the software, they're coming out with a video later and are doing a coast-to-coast demo by the end of the year. It's just a matter of maybe some refinements and more fleet learning, and then the big question of regulatory approval, which they disclose in the option: 

> **Please note that Self-Driving functionality is dependent upon extensive software validation and regulatory approval, which may vary widely by jurisdiction.** It is not possible to know exactly when each element of the functionality described above will be available, as this is highly dependent on local regulatory approval.

So really the only thing that would hold it back is regulators, to which Tesla could refer back to this disclaimer and say it just needs more time."
"One of the first things I thought too. However I'm wondering if that just alludes to how advanced the software currently is. No way they under deliver on something they are going to charge so much for and really leave themselves so open. It's super hard to believe we are already at this point though considering google and others have been working at it for so long. Tesla may have just pulled off one of the biggest technological ""scoops"" in history.time will tell though these are big words time for action."
"Yes indeed, great point.  Do you recall that Tesla similarly introduced autopilot hardware into production vehicles in fall 2014, along with a very limited demonstration on a closed track in Hawthorne, and did not activate or even demonstrate auto steering on shipped vehicles until an over-the-air update about a year later in fall 2015?  Similar situation here, perhaps.  We'll see if it works out again and how long it takes for updated software to fully utilize the hardware."
This is an in-house solution and they have more experience so I'd bet they can get to the current AP level fairly quickly.
Probably will rack up miles of test data much quicker than previous run 2 years ago
I'm betting it will be a couple months after ≡s start being delivered in volume. They will want as much data as possible to train the system and also cover their backs from any legal backlash. If you have x billions miles of statistics and lots of save video its a lot easier to argue your case in court. 
Maaaayyyybe
Interesting. I suppose if you ordered last Friday it hasn't gone into production yet... meaning that when it does you'll get the new hardware (because all cars coming off the line now have it). So maybe you got lucky and they upgraded you for free?
I'm in same boat. 
Sell it to someone who HAS to drive on their own in a couple years.
Yup.  Except for the Uber part!  Tesla Network...
"Except for

negative. just too complex
Model 3 is probably going to be the cheapest for a while
Yes it is. Powered by an Nvidia Titan.
"I'd assume if someone broke the window or something similar it would have a kill switch + alert direct to you phone. You could choose to disable the broken into vehicle. Now, they could still strip it for parts as it sits there, but you might also be able to tell it to drive home."
"Presumably if you were even able to send the car off with nobody in it, there would be some sort of security feature that meant it could protect itself. But I think you're probably thinking too far ahead. 

Tesla demand drivers have their hands on the wheel and are ready to take over with the current state of autopilot. I imagine full autopilot will still require someone in the vehicle alert and ready to take over if necessary. The system would have to be 99.9% accurate on all roads for the governments to allow cars to literally drive themselves places with nobody inside. 

But that's probably the future anyway. "
"Data is the key. Data is still recorded by ""the shadow"" even if the autopilot isn't engaged. They compare what the system would do vs the driver. Think Google. All their services are free, because the data they collect is more important."
It's able to read the speed signs
"Nvidia is supplying the onboard computer but Tesla is developing all of the software and neural net with ""Tesla Vision"""
"> Safe to assume completely Level 5 by next year when they do the NYC to LA demo?

Well... The demo car will have alpha/beta software capable of Level 5. But a coast to coast to coast trip can almost be done completely on Level 3 as Freeways are a pretty simple driving scenario.  Getting off the highway to a supercharger is another story though."
Pretty sure that's why the screen is sideways.
"According to https://electrek.co/2016/10/20/tesla-enhanced-autopilot-full-self-driving-capability/

> At “2 to 3 months from now”, Tesla expects that the new software validation for the Autopilot features on the new hardware will be completed and that performance should come to parity with the features on the current/previous version of the hardware V1 suite. At that point, with the continuously improving system, the ‘Enhanced Autopilot’ option will start to become better than the last ‘Autopilot Convenience Features’ version.

>We are talking about the Traffic Aware Cruise Control (TACC), Autosteer on highways, Autopark and the ‘Summon’ feature.

>Tesla CEO Elon Musk expects that every “2 to 3 months” thereafter the company will release software updates with more significant improvements.

>These improvements will enable the new ‘Enhanced Autopilot’ features like ‘On-ramp to Off-ramp’, which sounds like a complete level 3 autonomy on the freeway, Autosteer+, which enables Autosteer in “more complex roads”, and ‘Smart Summon’, which is obviously a smarter ‘Summon’ feature and like Autosteer+, which can handle more complex environments.

>Then there’s ‘Full Self-Driving Capability’. It will come significantly later, but you save $1,000 by buying it when you order the car instead of just having Tesla activate it when it becomes available through software update. Additionally, Tesla activates more cameras to improve the other features when buying the option, which is $3,000 more expensive than ‘Enhanced Autopilot’ for a total of an $8,000 option."
"Honestly it seems pretty clearly to me as a way to raise capital instantly off the hype from the announcement. With the extra cost to activate later (even though it'll only be available later anyways), they incentivize paying for the features now, which allows the company access to revenue they might not otherwise have."
"From the masses it will be HD mapping, statistical data and probably an element of fleet learning. The HD maps will be valuable as the car will know what lane to be in very early on and able to plan way ahead and also to the cm accuracy. It also gives an element of backup in poor conditions. The car still knows where the lanes are well in advanced and the radar scans for vehicles ahead. 

Musk also spoke about around 1000 testers. It could be that these testers give permission to more data being sent like video during significant close calls and where the driver had to take over. That would be very valuable. But this is all pure speculation."
"Late 2017 (probably right at the end of the year around December, is my guess). Of course, there's the matter of ""Elon Time"", but I'm optimistic ;)"
No. Also it straightened itself. 
"It doesn't seem like you're really getting anything in the near-term, except saving $1000 from upgrading later, when it will cost $4000, or possibly more. It's not clear if using all 8 cameras will improve your Enhanced Autopilot functionality at all. I have an MX 60D on order and I'll probably upgrade to EAP but not autonomous, I assume most will, but for those that do pay for autonomous it will help Tesla'a immediate cash flow. That's probably why they're offering it."
"I'm looking, haven't found anything yet."
Yeah me too. Not sure what kind of big event this is if he isn't doing a presentation?
Look at the additional price - this isn't included in base price
"I agree, but to be fair, it's out of reach financially for most people. 66k + 5k+ 3k w/ no other options. "
"People should be talking about this more. Nissan, Toyota and GM must be really re-evaluating their value proposition right now (and the other car makers too)."
"They have to get real world data in order to calibrate.

It will be available by December"
"> Talk about shipping before it's done... jeez.. TACC and autosteer not available on cars leaving the production line now?

A direct result of how society pushes for more now now now now, damn the consequences.

They could have withheld all of it until around December when more of the software was ready, but people act like ravenous beasts concerning stuff like this.
"
"Why not? Cause it's never been done before? If you'd bring someone from 10 years ago to today and present him to our most recent tech he'd say you're a wizard. The more knowledge we have, the faster we acquire it."
Musk did mention a while back in an interview about having redundant computers and power buses. 
I imagine the car would transition to manual mode.
">  I'm a little worried about redundancy

Will they have two radars? Two computers? etc? Maybe that's why it's costing way more for the full system.

"
"Believe it.  If they're going to start shipping a model 3 in one year, you better believe there are ever-improving prototypes being made right now."
They have already made many model 3s in their factory. Prototypes.
"It's probably just poorly worded.

*dreams crushed*"
I think most people realize that :P
"More accurately: They don't have ENABLED software. Musk is going to show a video of the software running, they just aren't confident enough in it to deploy it to the fleet yet (or may not legally be allowed to)"
Isn't the neural net technically the software? It just needs to be trained right?
They are homonyms. Confusion is inevitable.
It kinda makes you question what mistakes go unnoticed by them in the engineering/production of their cars.
Without braking there will be breaking. 
"Whoa! You're right! They say ""breaking"" instead. Hopefully Elon wrote this, otherwise..."
They only had TWO extra days to refine.........
"As Tesla has said from the beginning, people are paying now for future R&D. The Model 3 is only feasible because of the S & X. The S & X were only feasible because of the Roadster. This is just a more tangible recognition of that. "
You could not buy the car now
That's definitely worth bringing up during the Q&A or tweeting to Elon.
"But, really, what's $10k (or $12k) for a $35k MSRP car?

I guess that's how they expect to reach 30% margins on Model S :-)"
Why did you find that pricing?
"With my new job, I'm aiming for April. Buying a house first."
"Musk just tweeted that there is video of it navigating a complex environment, and that's what they were refining."
All cars starting today have the hardware.  That might not have been the case on Monday 
They're going to post a video of AP2.0 in an urban environment - that's what they needed a couple more days for. 
"Announcing this sort of thing could require a lot of input from lots of divisions (including legal) about what Tesla says and how they say it. 

There are also updates to the design studio to account for the new hardware and software feature tiers."
Check out @elonmusk's Tweet: https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/788902908175618049?s=09
"Exactly.  I don't think this was the planned announcement.  And no one is calling out Elon for ""confirming"" it was Part 2 *today*"
Looks like so far a press release with a 30 minute Q&A with the press currently happening.
"I believe its a conference call, with only reporters allowed to listen in."
I think this was the announcement.
Blog post
https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware
It undoubtedly already uses neural nets for existing AP.
"It's just hardware, dude"
Apple is never first to market with new features or tech. They wait and refine it to a smooth product.
Elon has previously spoken about having redundant power buses and computing power. This is nothing new to him as Head Designer at SpaceX. Manned certified rockets have triple modular redundancy. 
"I suppose you'd have further redundancy with the radar backing up the cameras, and perhaps the ultrasonics for ""Oh shit, need to pull over now!"" redundancy. Processing and power redundancy seem a little tougher..."
Yes. The vehicle comes with all the hardware but enabling it all is a very expensive software switch.
"You can order it enabled or disabled--but it's a hardware upgrade, too. It's on the order page to Tesla's website. 

Apparently for this who did order it enabled, hardware upgrades may be required, too (free) as Tesla figures out autopilots. Still pretty sketchy in real world experiences on perfect California roads in perfect weather.  "
I can believe it at face value.
"It would be essentially impossible to release a worldwide car in a year that isn't even cabable of being driven. Even if you had it there's red tape.

There's also the question if people would be ready for that. I think most people would call it a bug, not a feature."

"I probably wouldn't have gotten knocked off my rocker by an SUV in a crosswalk if it had been Tesla looking every way at once. Humans should, but don't always, look both ways before turning."
Really? Downvotes because the original post had a typo?
"Yeah, the base car is cheap but the add-ons are what pads Tesla's margins. The autopilot is going to be a big profit driver for them so it has to be expensive."
"Lidar has a problem seeing through rain (even light rain), fog, smoke, etc"
"The short version I recall is that lidar is based on lasers that won't work in snow/rain/dust. Vision will work as well as human eyes in those cases and radar will improve upon that. 

"
The hardware is available; the software is not ready
I guess the vehicles 'have the necessary hardware' for fully autonomous driving. Doesn't mean it can be used everywhere 
"It's legal to take your money; the disclaimer on the order page says it may never be available. But, they've got your $8000."
"> lack of odometer in the 3

Well, that would be illegal, so...

"
That's the way is sounded to me which I think is **very** odd. I find it hard to believe.
"At this point, it might well be Tesla.  If the AP software makes an error and drives into a wall, I'd expect them to pick up the bill.  If you hit a patch of ice and drive off the road, then the car owner would likely pay.  We'll see ..."
Bounces radar underneath the car in front.
They made an entire [blog post](https://www.tesla.com/blog/upgrading-autopilot-seeing-world-radar-0) about how the radar works.
And what if it has to back up in the rain? Like a long driveway
"Correct, $5000 for autopilot + $3000 for full self-driving"
On model s and x but I believe nothing is confirmed for model 3
Can confirm. $5000 for enhanced autopilot + $3000 for full autonomy.
Sounds like it. Or maybe they came with an even better solution since.
It is not released yet.
Supposedly just the emergency features (braking) and none of the self driving (including lane keep)
"I believe only the safety features like emergency braking are included. Autosteer, auto park, summon, lane changing etc. isn't. "
all the cars will have all the hardware. it's the software that will be different.
"5k for ""enhanced"" autopilot, $3k for self driving on top of that"
">When will the new cars be up to speed with driver assistance with existing cars?  

The ""Enhanced Autopilot"" description in the design studio makes it sound like the new cars will be be getting current features around December 2016."
Dude for eight grand up front people are not going to have a ton of patience which is why this is a weird decision. It almost conveys that they are very far along already I think.
The announcement doesn't really mean anything in that regard considering we haven't seen anything about the interior of the Model 3. 
Both are needed. Full self-driving is an option that sits on top of Enhanced Autopilot.
No retrofit. It would be like a spinal replacement. 
Discount?
"If it makes you feel any better, it'll be at least a couple years before you can take advantage of all AP2 has to offer."
Those features should be reactivated in December.  At most you'll just have to wait a few weeks.
"If you were given the option to receive current AP hardware that will work fine between now and December but then never change, or new AP hardware that won't work UNTIL December, but after that continue to become more and more capable for the life of the car, which would you opt-in to?"
"> **Standard Safety Features**  
These active safety technologies, including collision avoidance and automatic emergency braking, will become available in December 2016 and roll out through over-the-air software updates

Reading is good
"It was mentioned in the call that they will be the standard safety features would be activated by December.  New cars ordered today have a delivery estimate of December (based on what I saw), so it doesn't look like it will affect new orders too much, but it will affect deliveries between now and December."
Level 5 autonomy - Ability to drive in all but the least likely edge cases with no human in the car.
"December

Edit: https://youtu.be/IZ90J7i_l20?t=352"
"You  do realize that this is marketing spin to,disguise the fact that they are pulling the autopilot stuff out? It's actually a pretty good misdirection, but obvious once you see the comment about autopilot features being unavailable during the testing period."
"There was no live event. It was a blog post / press release, followed by a media Q&A conference call."
Here's an audio recording. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ90J7i_l20
No. Legally this is still just an advanced cruise control system.
I wonder if Elon will be dri- er in the car.
We don't know the pricing for the Model 3 yet.
Wow that is tight. They probably started a few days ago with the new hardware so who knows!
I believe it was said in the media Q&A that all vehicles which started production this week would have it. 
Yup!
"I don't think it will impact the overall range: the engine uses A LOT more energy than a processor (for example, when accelerating, a Tesla consumes more or less 9 phone batteries a second)"
"Slashdot has become toxic, stopped spending time there after being a long time reader. It's just so depressing with all the negativity and cynicism..."
I don't remember him preferring radar over cameras. He does prefer radar over _lidar_ though...
They probably determined through their own internal testing that cameras are good enough. Forward facing radars are great because they help you anticipate situations in fast moving traffic but apart from that the cameras are sufficiently good. And yes you are correct that this is mobileye's approach to autonomous cars too. 
[No](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/789007996038721536)
Nope. Elon said it would cost more than the cost of a new vehicle so they're not offering it.
"1) Elon said in the press call that Autopilot 1.0 will continue to improve. 

2) AP 2.0 will probably use certain things learnt from 1.0. Things like mapped highways and recent radar developments. What AP 1 cars learn with the radar can be applied to 2.0 and vice-versa. 

3) Who knows what other companies will do. The timeline for most of these companies seems to be around 2020. 

4) This does give the Model 3 a huge advantage of the bolt. 

5) Not sure how it will deal with range. Going to a supercharger for some quick juice is possible, granted there is one close to you. Otherwise, you may need to manually plug in a cable once it has parked at work. 

6) Although superchargers could get more congested, the Tesla can now autonomously move out the way once it is done meaning you don't need to wait for the owner to come back to move the car so that does help. 

7) Interesting question about the performance. We would probably be more comfortable if the car doesn't erratically accelerate and take sharp concerns although from a safety point of view having fast acceleration to move out the way is still nice. 

8) This autonomous tech can probably be applied to the Tesla bus which will be announced next year. Will probably be more suitable for people with mobility difficulties as opposed to a car. Especially as a shuttle. But you certainly could do what you proposed (legislation permitting of course)

9) Unfortunately, the main issue is at the factory and the majority of the workers don't have the S/X although maybe some will get the 3. However, recent proposals is to have a shuttle service and transport new cars with a train as opposed to have them sit in the car lot to wait for transportation and that will help ease congestion there. "
In California companies are allowed to test autonomous vehicles as long as there is a qualified driver in the drivers seat ready to take over if something is wrong.  Google has been doing it for 6 years.
"If it's private property, the answer is no. It's the same reason you can drive as fast as you want at drag strips without being cited for speeding."
I don't think so. Car companies test prototype cars on the road all the time. 
"I imagine using Tesla's self driving for Uber/Lyft results in Tesla taking on some kind of liability with no additional revenue.

It's completely acceptable to ""human drive"" a Tesla for Uber/Lyft"
Yes of course
"I don't know about your specific situation, but I would imagine the point of contact for your order at Tesla would reach out and offer the self-driving upgrade before delivery (since the extra surcharge is only if you choose to enable after delivery). I can't see them offering it gratis or at a discount just because you happened to order in the ""grace period""."
"That's Bosch doing their own testing, which happened to be in a Tesla."
It can definitely reverse.
You think it'll be under 35k with full autonomy *enabled*? 
If it's already been manufactured it doesn't sound like it.
It won't :(
"Most likely not. If you are picking it up soon, then it was produced a few weeks ago. But we will know more for sure after the QA is over in the next ten mins. Press will start tweeting details fast then they will post stories. "
"I've taken a couple of classes in this, and that website was still confusing because of the way they laid out the info.

At 80 mph, braking distance on level ground is 614 feet.  Reaction distance is 294 feet (assuming person reaction of 2.5 seconds).  Hopefully autopilot reaction will be less than that, in which case it is within the camera sight distance. 820 feet does seem kinda low (for camera sight distance), but often the road will curve before that, so a longer range camera has diminishing returns."
"No, Nvidia. Elon said it was between the two, but nvidia had better hardware. "
"Nope, NVidia Titan GPU."
"If they weren't manufactured on Wednesday, October 19, I doubt it. "
Come on /u/marques-brownlee ... you know you don't see 8 cameras around your car. 
If autopilot works right now then it's AP 1.
"Tesla says you can't do it, but it's not really up to them once you own the car."
"You will probably have to sign some kind of licensing agreement - you may own the car, but have limited rights to how you use it.  This would be good also for people who abuse autopilot - Tesla might be able to revoke driving privileges."
"It said ""using a self-driving Tesla"", which indicates to me that you can't dispatch it away to handle ride sharing using fully autonomous mode (or possibly you can't use auto-drive even if a human is in the driver seat).  If a human was driving it, you could do it for Uber or Lyft - they would never be able to stop you from doing that.  At least that's my take on it."
"Hmmm, sounds like the kind of overreach and corporate game they mock ""old"" companies for"
Check the Design Studio.
Do you have radar? Are you able to successfully merge today with fast approaching cars on the road? Why shouldn't a computer be able to do the same?
"It's a camera-based system (along with Radar and Ultrasonics), instead of LiDar technology like Google is using. Google relies heavily on pre-made maps whereas Tesla does not. Google vehicles can't leave their area because their maps currently only exist in the SF area."
No giant spinning light dome
It says add after delivery 
"Hardware is always included, but you have to pay for unlocking the autopilot convenience features. Emergency braking on the other hand is always active"
Cars always came with hardware. You pay to unlock the software 
"No, they released software v8.0 which improved on autopilot 1.0 (which just stays within lane markings). This is autopilot 2.0 which is 100% autonomous, like you get in your car and arrive at your destination with no input."
This is AP 2.0. The 8.0 software update which improved AP was a few months ago.
"Okay so what does 'All cars built will have it' mean. What did that really mean? The description says it adds cameras. Not enables features. Adds physical features. 

Doesn't look like standard hardware to me.  "
"Im sure it can, as long as you are in the drivers seat."
"It has already ended. The Verge has a couple of points from session but no one has published the complete trasncript

http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/19/13341194/tesla-autopilot-shadow-mode-autonomous-regulations"
"It already ended, Electrek said that they would post an article shortly with information from the Q&A"
Not Tesla's fault your country/state/county bans what Tesla has made available to you.
You don't get a partial refund for buying an upgraded car that can do 155 mph when the legal limit is 65.
"Does autopilot currently work on your car?  If so, then you have the 1.0 hardware."
Do you have 3 cameras located near your rear view mirror?  They may be hard to see.
just spend another 100k next year 
Look at the volume. It'll get interesting to see when they update the Model 3 to get a sort of realistic comparison.
Its a $3K option (price is likely same as on Model S/X)
Are you looking at the design studio?  I think that's just a lease amount.  Switch to cash for an actual price.
Where??
"$1,000 extra to upgrade later.  I'm going to order it upfront."
"If people are worried about vaporware, it's probably better to wait a few months to see it enabled at the factory."
"I highly doubt this will be vaporware. Based on the technical specs (and assuming the video demo Elon tweets is fully functioning as explained), they seem pretty set on the move forward."
No
I don't think they'll have to. Tesla don't publish the captured imagery.
Called it! :)
They didn't remove the steering wheel or the pedals.
Well then I guess you can save some money by not purchasing this option
Then you can pay through the nose for the privilege.
Then maybe you should have studied more. ; )
"As an Aerospace Engineer, I'm skeptical of your perception of what is [im]possible by our best minds engaged together on this righteous quest."
Can you elaborate?
"> I am extremely(!) skeptical of this

My take is that Elon's thinking is to start from human capabilities (basically vision and experience-based) and have a computer do the processing. Maybe he does not believe there is a need to have sensors with super-human capacities to accomplish full autonomy. And it may very well work."
"Same here -- skeptical and excited at the same time, for the precedent of mass production of such sensor and compute hardware.  I'm a control unit software engineer at Autonomous Solutions Inc."
"Doesn't this announcement make Tesla the first automaker with a mass production car (S, X) with full autonomy features? "
You whore.
Dick
Take my upvote :/
"Its not that they haven't reached Parity with Mobileye. Its just that the quickest way to get data and mileage is to sell cars with the hardware and have them driven.

It is also imperative that Tesla move away from Mobileye as quickly as possible given the current attitude between the two companies.

So while it will be kinda crappy to order a Tesla and not have Autopilot. I would gladly take the new deactivated hardware that has power far beyond what the AP Gen 1 has and get it over time."
"No, the hardware is standard so you can upgrade everything after delivery. It just costs more."
May want to wait until the smoke clears...
No. You don't have the required hardware. Only new delivered cars will have the requisite hardware.
It was never going to be able to.
nice
heads up display
It was explained in part 2.  Fully Autonomous = no need for dash.
Oh God I hope not.  I'll be obese by the end of the first year with my 3. 
"No, he specifically said new hardware would be required for full autonomy"
This was never said.
Markets are closed...
"Hardware isn't the hard part, that's why.  The software is the hard part"
Hughh I say... But yeah the markets are closed so it's not gonna move until pre market.
Wait till the market opens tomorrow.

i just bought some shares yesterday.. i was considering selling right away after this announcement but.. idk.. maybe i'll hold. haha this is awesome!
There is no live stream
"nope. Regular autopilot
Hardware 2.0 = enhanced autopilot + self driving"
Lets leave political shitposting out of something this sacred.
"In the next 10 years, probably."
If you really wanted that just make an RC rig.
Well I mean the doors would be locked and good luck taking control without the keys if you break a window. Maybe then it could lock you in and drive you to the nearest police station :)
Can't source it right now but it's supposed to be an NVIDIA Titan
All I know from the call is that it can do 12 Trillion calculations per second. 
Because Tesla engineers know nothing. 
"8 cameras? 12 ultrasonics? You only need (in theory) to see that far in front of you to have braking time. The ultrasonics replace the radars for most purposes (stationary objects, parking, and railings). They have 3 rearward facing cameras to see things coming. "
"There's like one or two of those that are not even available to the public. 

More like non-existent. "
No...
"well as cool as ap2 is, i do have to admit i was a little bummed that was all they were announcing."
Only the new cars with the new hardware have to live without autopilot features for a few months.
"They're not disabling anyone's autopilot, the software for autopilot 2.0 isn't ready, but the hardware is. New vehicles will ship with the hardware and software will be updated to function. Every Tesla with 1.0 hardware will still be fully functional. "
"It's because this whole announcement is a smokescreen to obscure that fact. Rather than actuallly admit that autopilot was a fuck up, they hide it in all this stuff they've said they were gonna do from the start. This announcement means nothing aside from ""we have to shut off autopilot because it's killing people."""
How come ?
What?
"That's not how Tesla has operated. Tesla has upfront, one-time prices to offset the cost of software development. They've already revealed the prices for these upgrades. Additionally, they won't have the ""software preinstalled"". They will in the future, but even the upgraded ones coming out right now will only have a basic upgrade as the software will be slowly rolled out over the next several months"
"Supposedly the radar saw it, but the camera couldn't see it, so AP didn't brake. And apparently didn't warn the driver there was a large solid object approaching, either. So at least some of the criticism of autopilot is valid. It dodges people cutting into your lane, but can't give you an audible warning when you're about to drive into a wall? It can't slow down by 10-15% if it's unsure of what's going on up ahead?

The biggest difference is in the control software and image processing, both hardware and software. LIDAR is going to be so cheap in the future, there will be no sense in not having it."
Then don't buy a Tesla.
"Tesla Model S P100D has 315 miles of range. The non P model 100D should have more range than the P model so it will be somewhere north of 315 miles (not yet released, but should be in the near future)"
NEDC rated range of 381 miles for the P100D
"What is illegal about what they are doing? Your car will not drive itself until it's legal to do so, regardless of the hardware you have. Offering it upfront allows you to buy it at a discount so that when it is legal, you have it."

"No one is forcing you to enable autopilot, at least not yet."
It's optional. It's not like they're removing the steering wheel. You won't even have the option for self-driving unless you give them a bunch of extra money.
They see where the future is going and are trying to get there before other companies do. By doing it on their own schedule and without external pressure they are already ahead of the competition.
Now the only Californian roulette is when autopilot triggers armed road rage from the car tailgating behind because it didn't magically make the traffic jam disappear. 
">That is a musk. It's great to see Tesla putting this in.

"I mean, I'm pretty sure you can remotely turn the heat on in the Tesla so it's warm when you get in.  

The sensors should also be able to see through snow,  rain,  dust, fog,  and even the car in front of it.  Also a lot of the models are all wheel drive so I'm assuming snow isn't an issue."
"Buy gloves that work with touch screens, it isn't hard."

That's no joke.  It's awesome and handy 99% of the time, but when you first get in the car at 6 AM and it's ten below, it would help to have a ""PLEASE CRANK THE HEAT"" knob so you can keep your gloves while it warms up."

"If Tesla's already going to upgrade Superchargers to connect automatically, what are the odds that it's a whole Supercharger 2.0 package?

With the Mission E specs, and now the ""Ultra E"" charging network in Europe promising 350 kW charging, Tesla won't want to fall behind in charging speed. It would make piles of sense to upgrade charging speed and auto-plug-in in one go. 

So, wild speculation: look for faster supercharging at ""Model 3, Part 3"" or a battery oriented event. "

This is harder to show though. Obviously Tesla wouldn't knowingly crash... so you can't get information on it in a simple fashion.
"How does that compare to apple?  Apple doesn't want to integrate with others.  You can't say that about tesla, as they have made batteries for other car companies and openly want other car companies to adopt tesla standards.  That is the exact opposite of apple.

As of now, Tesla doesn't have full autonomy working in their own cars.  This is an announcement where they are putting in hardware today that hopefully will allow a car to use autonomy they release in a few years.  Full autonomy probably won't be close to functional in these cars for another 3-4 years highway and 7-8 years in urban areas.  I wouldn't look for a commercial product that can be sold to other companies for at least 10 years.

Honestly if it leads to safer roads I'm all for it
"""Your husband could have lived if he pressed this button"". 

Pretty dark indeed, but I reckon it's needed for statistics because when 1 Tesla crashes the world is on it's high heels, not considering how much people actually could be saved by this.

I love driving, so I'm afraid we won't be allowed to drive ourselves anymore in 20-40 years.."
"I was wondering just the other day why AP doesn't stop me doing stupid things in a watching mode.  If I'm about to pull into the side of a car when changing lanes why let me?

It sounds like Autonomous will happily watch me crash and die but report ""I would have done X to save a life""."
"Precisely. The data tesla is gathering is only useful for legislation if they release all of it publicly. As of yet, they've never released any data."
"I am confused - you say it doesn't prove anything but if tesla can compare the actual human input that resulted in a death against what actions autopilot would have taken does that not actually prove something?

You are correct it will not show times human reaction was better but do you genuinely think that the autopilot will fail more times than a human driver?"
Because if this is truly level 5 automation then those times *won't exist*
[Here's the whole thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ90J7i_l20)
I read that on The Verge http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/19/13340938/tesla-autopilot-update-model-3-elon-musk-update I haven't seen an in depth write up of the Q&A yet
"I said this half-joking, but the reality is that the **moment** the AP 2.0 functionality surpasses that of AP 1.0, I'm going to sell my 2015 model and buy the new version.  It's already the best car I've ever owned.  A HUGE part of my delight with the car is Autopilot.  I'll happily buy another one with an upgraded version.  It would be silly to switch up before 2.0 is functional, though.

For those who were curious about the numbers, I have a 2015 85D with about 14k miles.  KBB shows the value around $76k.  I owe slightly less than that.  Monthly payments are about $1,350."
"Negative that's just to enable the software.  Retrofit not offered as its integral to the car (wiring harness, gpu, etc),"
"I'll entertain any reasonable offer on my fully optioned P90DL with about 3,200 miles."
"Absolutely!  I love cars and I'm still excited every day I get in my Tesla!   I have enough disposable income to easily justify the car so I don't consider it a financial burden as you imply above.  

When the new one overtakes the old one in terms of autopilot functionality, I'll trade up.  

That's the price of technology progress.  A few of us subsidize the companies' r&d budget by buying the latest, greatest, soon-to-be-obsolete things."
Musk has said that options will be cheaper on the 3. I'm guessing it will be $3500 and $2500 on the 3 vs $5000 and $3000 on the S/X.
At the very least.  I can't see them making it any cheaper unless they also cut the price of the S/X version.  It is possible it costs more and the base unit strips some sensors.
"On the Norwegian Tesla page there's a ~3,6% difference in the pricing of the full autopilot suite between S and the X. So I'm sure it will be significantly cheaper on the model 3."
"Well, the drivers could put them into the rideshare mode and have it make money for you while you work. That would bring down the number of Taxis and rideshare app traffic in the same areas. 

I do agree it would be hilarious watching 50 Teslas parading around the more affluent areas.  

"
"I mean... won't the energy cost be higher than parking?

Or risk of having your Tesla being discharged when you'll go back?"
"The hardware is installed by default.  The customer has to pay the extra amount to unlock the features.  This is because the research and development costs of this complex programming is expensive. 


  The price of the hardware is probably minimal."
Full self driving requires enhanced autopilot so it's just a bit more on top. Really it's 8k for full self driving vs just enhanced autopilot
Research and development costs
"> Also, I wonder if you can location snipe. Like, you see a friend about to go home in his Tesla so before he gets in the car but after he summons it on his phone, you send a Facebook invite. The invite is set for 15 minutes away at a gay bar or Yatusk Russia or something, and he does not pay attention and the car just automatically takes him there.

I love the way people are already planning how to fuck around with their friends using this :P"
"On 1, probably sensor park. It has self parking capabilities.

On 2, I ASSUME by calendar, they mean more like how Google does it now, it tracks your back and forth locations and then gives you estimated time to work and traffic on the way home on your usual quitting time. Do this frequently enough, it becomes a habit, and the car is likely right in your day to day dealings. I can also imagine a UI as not being completely touchless, but maybe when you sit down and buckle up, you get a countdown ""Let's go to =work="" where you can abort it within 15 seconds or so and choose from a list of alternate destinations or input for new. Humans are predictable, we deviate from our norms very rarely."
All vehicles will come with it equipped you just have to pay to activate it.

It will be interesting to see how this all plays out with respect to parking ramps and the like.

Call me simplistic but you could use the same rules that apply today. Act as if the driver *had* been at the wheel and make legal/insurance decisions based on that.
"> Third step: Legal, insurance, and possibly infrastructure updates to allow and account for self driving cars (????)

This will lag behind reality. Lots of people getting pulled over in their fully autonomous cars and getting tickets for it."
"If anyone thinks that third step will be anything short of a horrendous nightmare, they're kidding themselves."
"> insurance

Won't be a problem, it works with the current model, since you commanded the car to start, you are responsible for what it does.

> possibly infrastructure updates

Not necesary for this technology

> Legal

This is the first time in a few decades that a new US car company successfully started. The governement will probably not try to slow them down as this would give foreign car makers an advantage."
"Right. I read it as ""hardware capable"" but not software capable. "
The code isn't done yet. Even cruise control doesn't work right now!
"And the software would need to improve. 

Elon previously mentioned that they believe it will take about 6 billion autopilot miles to get out of beta. They've only got I think 300 million, but the massive fleet expansion of model 3 will really shorten the time it takes to get there. Theoretically by 2019."
Dui laws will take decades to change. Way too many lobby groups are for dui prosecution. 
"So when or is capable... And someone does get pulled over drunk af as the vehicle drives... How does the law work then? What if people try to drive drunk and blame the car, is there a logv system?"
"As long as a human is in the car, it is legal. I wish I had a link, but IIRC there is no law ""prohibiting"" self-driving cars, as long as there is a driver in the car when on public roads."
"Holy shit. 

I live in a big city. The idea of my wife (who works earlier than me) commuting to work, the car coming back to pick me up, driving me to work and then returning home (saving $300/mo+ on parking), then rinsing and repeating for the evening commute home... wow. This changes urban commuting immensely. "
"So in the future there will be loads of fun putting random appointments into the unattended phones of Tesla owners. Even better if they are drunk and going to sleep on the way home.

TESLA: Destination reached.  
OWNER: ...Bleurgh, it's light, where am ??!  
TESLA: Appointment ""You are lost"" due in 5 minutes. Address Alaska.  
OWNER: !!!!!!!  "

"I was thinking the same. At this rate, I'm not even sure my 2 toddlers will even have to pass the DL. "
"Imagine beyond that.  Imagine no traffic lights, and cars all seamlessly communicating with one another to time their turns perfectly without interruption.  Imagine no traffic waves, all cars travelling on a highway at capacity at maximum efficiency.  All cars in a line starting and stopping in sync.  Like one giant, beautiful, interconnected machine."
The biggest problem I see is cars driving around a block when there is no parking space. Large cities will need to seriously expand there parking solutions or have a lot of empty cars driving around.
"You won't be sending ""your"" car.  Why pay for 24/7 access for a car when you only drive it 20-60 min a day (or whatever)?  We'll have on-demand car delivery where you pay by the mile, get a discount when you ride share, and will work out to be less than the costs of individual car ownership. "
Unless you have something in your calendar in which case it will take you to that address
That's probably better than trying to interpret drunken slurring. 
It will take you to your destination based on your calendar. After drinking all night it might not take you home. It might take you to work.

"Hardware is included, and emergency safety features are included (like auto emergency braking). This should be true for S, X, and 3. ""Convenience features"" like parking, autosteer, adaptive cruise, and future autonomy levels will probably remain extra."
They want to train it without the sensors to see what a truely unassisted human does. My bet is they will reenable that later.
"shit, have we really come this far that fast?"
Would you be able to upgrade?
"The announcement says that cars rolling off the assembly line *today* (i.e., for delivery in the next couple weeks) already have the hardware. So it sounds like there is going to be a sizable number of people who lack even the basic autopilot functionality for several weeks.

That would be fairly disappointing."
I think it'll tell you to pull in front of a supercharger and tell you to release the wheel as the car parks itself perfectly to help align it with the snake charger?
UI better be snappier. 
"Therein lies the issue with the naming scheme, true autopilot in a plane still requires a pilot to pay close attention, don't want to fly into a storm and all that. Yet you have confused it with the plane being able to take off,  travel and land by itself. "
"At some point, I wonder if it becomes more costeffective to fund programs that make humans worse drivers, instead of trying to make computers better drivers."
"I dunno, there isn't much talk of redundancy in areas like brakes and steering.  There are what, 200k teslas, I can't find a recent number, and how many miles are on the average tesla?  Plus, you need to model or detect quality of drivetrain, brake pads, tires, chassis components.  Will it detect a broken ball joint, tie rod, etc.  How will it behave when any mechanical component fails.  What are all the limp in home modes, and the transition into them.  Even if you get it working in ideal, it's these use cases that get dangerous.  If tesla owns the car, they can control service, and somewhat mitigate it that way, otherwise, they have the burden to handle all these failures of the car."
"> 1000x safer than a human

not difficult. Put down the phone, there, you're 1000x safer."
Bye bye Uber and Lyft drivers....
"I think he means you can't use this on Uber and Lyft to earn money. You will earn money through them.

"I know this one by heart lol
 

They are 6 levels, ranging from 0-5.

0: The car can't control itself, but it warns you about dangers in the road. 

1: Driver must be ready to take control at any time. Automated system may include features such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Parking Assistance with automated steering, and Lane Keeping Assistance (LKA).

2: This is when the car can accelerate, brake and steer on its own in limited circumstances, like a highway. Think Autopilot here.

3: Within known, limited environments (such as freeways), the driver can safely turn their attention away from driving tasks. The 1st Gen Autopilot wasn't quite here, but it certainly touched this area. 

Level 4: The automated system can control the vehicle in all but a few environments such as severe weather. The driver must enable the automated system only when it is safe to do so. When enabled, driver attention is not required.


5: Other than setting the destination and starting the system, no human intervention is required. The automatic system can drive to any location where it is legal to drive. This is why I got the impression Autopilot 2.0 was a level 5."
He said the car could drive itself cross country without you being in it. That sounds like 5 to me?
I'll buy one of those boring old non-self driving cars just to get my hands on a Tesla. 
"It does open up many questions... How far does the old tech have the possibility to go? Can it be retrofitted? Can the old tech benefit from the new tech at all? Is the new tech *really* fully autonomous (meaning, there wont be a 3.0 that does something this one cant do)?"
That's how I got my P85 at a ridiculously low price :D  And I drive my cars into the dirt so no loss for me now!
you can upgrade after purchase
Hopefully it means the old models will resale for very cheap. 
"I always tell people to lease, not buy a Tesla. This is the reason :)"
Let us all bask in the glory of consumer excess from automation. Its time for the 15 hour work week.
I'm super curious what autonomous vehicles will do to EMS. It's often necessary to have 2-4 people. 
"I'm ok with this. 

It will force guaranteed income or there will be mass riots as the truckers, taxi drivers, ubers and a host of other workers are laid off. 

I imagine it will start as an extension of unemployment, then a further extension as the employment numbers don't recover, eventually just every one on unemployment will get that for the rest of their lives. "
I drive oil truck in the remote north of Canada. I have absolutely no fears for my job for at least the next couple decades 
"I think most commercial vehicles will have a person in the cab for a long time, just to monitor stuff. "
"Don't forget the support jobs. 

Once long haul truckers are gone then we will start seeing rest areas along the highway start to close down. Diners, hotels, gas stations, entire towns will be shutting down just like how the introduction of highways killed alot of small towns. 

I'd say for every 10 truckers off the road, we're looking at another 2 people out of work. "

They're doing their own thing."
"Yes, Elon discussed it in the Master Plan Part 2:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux

>Sharing

>When true self-driving is approved by regulators, it will mean that you will be able to summon your Tesla from pretty much anywhere. Once it picks you up, you will be able to sleep, read or do anything else enroute to your destination.

>You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost. This dramatically lowers the true cost of ownership to the point where almost anyone could own a Tesla. Since most cars are only in use by their owner for 5% to 10% of the day, the fundamental economic utility of a true self-driving car is likely to be several times that of a car which is not.

>In cities where demand exceeds the supply of customer-owned cars, Tesla will operate its own fleet, ensuring you can always hail a ride from us no matter where you are."
"Yeah, I was surprised to see this ignored by anybody else. I found it to be the most interesting part.

> “Please note also that using a self-driving Tesla for car sharing and ride hailing for friends and family is fine, but doing so for revenue purposes will only be permissible on the Tesla Network, details of which will be released next year.”"
"That's my understanding from the 10 year plan he put out. Give it a read, it's pretty descriptive about their intentions in that regard."
"Same as the current autopilot. Hardware will be standard, activating will be optional. Makes sense."
Well they're using the NVidia Titan GPU along with 8 likely high resolution cameras and new and improved ultrasonic sensors plus all the wiring hardware. That's all going to run a couple thousand in cost and they need to make margin and profit on the feature and also enough margin to cover all the people who don't buy the feature but still have the hardware on their vehicle.
[deleted]
"Hardware and basic safety features (collision avoidance, emergency braking) are included. Unlocking other (software) features is extra."
[deleted]
Totally intrigued. Hoping Fred has some more news on that...
"Wireless would make the most sense.  Have the car drive over an in-ground pad and it can chill there until charged.  They'll be built into driveways for sure, restaurants and rest areas too probably.  A bit of a stretch but potentially have some sort of system in major roads so just driving provides power?  

I don't know if wireless charging tech is that far along but it seems like a reasonable direction to move toward.  "
"it is a HUGE capability upgrade, that costs a lot of money to develop. Price is reasonable "
Yeah it's brutal but it's not like people will say no if they can afford it.
"It does say it adds more cameras. Not $8000 worth of cameras. 

But you're investing in *the future*. "
Still cheaper than AutoCAD
"Yeah, but think of the convenience it brings. The cost is justified because you are paying for the R+D, the same reason why you pay for things like music and movies digitally. It costs them nothing extra to give it to you, but they deserve payment for all the work they did."
"$8,000? I am showing $6k for enhanced autopilot and an additional $4k for full self-driving on the Model S design studio."
perhaps the money goes towards the increased liability.  we haven't seen an autopilot death litigated in court yet.
"Don't count on it, but if taking your car from a car to a designated driver is really possible, is that really not worth $8k? That's a lot cheaper than a new car, and feels like an even bigger upgrade."
I'd imagine this price will go down in the future/be incorporated into the price of the car. Especially if and when law mandates that all cars produced have these safety features.
Bingo.
"I think the wrinkle is that for the foreseeable future Autopilot will be more of a service than a product. Its function will depend heavily on downloading map and obstacle data from Tesla's servers, that was gathered by all Teslas. Without the map data Autopilot won't function. So, even though you can do whatever you want with the car itself, they're not obligated to provide a service to their competitors."

"I can't say it's perfect, but if you're gonna sell autonomy, it has to at least drive equally or better than humans. Seems to do it :D"
Racist. /s
"Yeah, but on the bright side you took delivery of a new Tesla last week! I'm up for a swap if you are. "
MKBHD mentioned in his P100D video that supposedly older cars would get upgrade options.
"Same here! I'm beyond pissed!!! They could have told us to delay, or maybe promised us guys who stretched our budgets to hold out. I feel super duped on the 2nd largest purchase I've ever made. I only hope that they will take care of anyone who took care of them for their 3rd quarter push! "
"Seems like you can upgrade after delivery, but it's gonna cost 10k instead of the extra 8k for the [enhanced autopilot and full self driving features.](http://m.imgur.com/a/rh1KX)

"
"Ordered 9/19 and vehicle production got bumped back about a month of the plan a few weeks ago. Now I see why everyone is getting pushed back after that first week of October (when I imagine they were installing the new equipment on the production line)

I personally think this would be a big mistake not having some retrofit plan for facelift vehicles. It's a bit too early to bring out the pitchforks but I think this is the first question they need to answer.

EDIT: From the design configuration tool it looks like you can enable after delivery for $6000 and $4000 retrospectively. Nice!"
"This is actually my exact though, and it sounds like a major detriment. 

Basically they had to cut the MobileEye code at some point, and this is how they're doing it. And their own code isn't up to snuff, so they're promising it in the future."
"Data scientist here, and I work with concepts like deep learning systems and neural networks.

I think it's at least as likely—if not more likely—that those features will be turned off because the cars will first need supervised learning: they need to see how many human drivers handle small variations on various situations without assistance from the car. When these neural nets are validated (which should be part of why it will always be running in ""shadow mode""), then the easy parts can be reintroduced as the network confidence increases.

It's a brilliant way to handle it, and I'm so jealous of the engineering going into this. "
"I'm a ""two marshmallows later"" kind of guy, but all the folks that have cars on order and want their marshmallows now have a reason to be upset.  I hope this doesn't upset the positive momentum that the company is building..."
so true.  makes me even more skeptical.  It's nothing more than something that should in theory work.  Whether they can deliver is a complete unknown.
they'll be enabling features quickly I assume.
This.
Same boat here with a 2013 85. I'm psyched about upgrading now!
"Same, except this time I'd get a much larger battery with higher performance!"
"Thanks for telling me my opinion, but I respectfully disagree.  If I paid for Autopilot (which is how it was advertised to everyone who has bought the car), I would want that level of functionality.  This is the kind of stuff that Tesla can probably get away with because of the fan base, but would never fly with an established car company.  Can you imagine GM selling you a feature, then disabling the feature after cashing your check?  
  
The second section on the Model S page on tesla.com is all about Autopilot and the features that you now will not actually have (as I said, in the short term).  With respect, that's bogus.
  
I'm 100% behind Tesla's vision and am thrilled that the hardware is in the cars, but I think that the more mature option would have been to FIRST get the system up to the point you have with the current setup, THEN announce more.  This feels too much like they are trying to make news.  Given all the SolarCity voting going on, the potential need to satisfy investors/the street, etc., I worry that they could become prone to stunts."
It's like leveling up your car as you drive it :D Just be glad windshield wipers aren't an unlockable.
"I think they mean it as a metaphor, not that they literally spent $150k on a palm pilot.

The $150k in this case I assume is related to their flair."
Helps in what way? Certainly doesn't help new owners. 
"Don't understand this view.  Why are people complaining their vehicle is obsolete within a year.  What do you want, Tesla to delay technology releases another 3 years for no reason, when it's available now?"
Doesn't sound very promising for current owners: https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/789007996038721536
"Right? As cool as this is, I'm a little disappointed to not see anything at all about model 3. Really hope this isn't the part 2 we were told about. "
"The fact that he had no news specific to model 3 (this was for all Teslas) makes me all the more skeptical I'll be getting my car in late 2017. I would have at least appreciated if he said ""and we're still on schedule with the model 3."" No news is bad news in this case."
"Maybe I'm in the minority here.... but I was hoping for something a bit more as far as an announcement is.  Not to downplay AP2.0 which is a huge achievement, but there's a lot of barriers to getting value out of it.  I don't see this really moving the needle on reservations.  We haven't even started getting into the litigation issues around using it.  "
"As far as I can tell, its only been announced that Model 3 will have the hardware. I don't see any assurance that the advanced features will be included in the base price Model 3."
This is Exactly why I Want a model 3 (and got my order in on Day 1) 
Yup this is me 100%.  Hopefully there's a part 3!
"Yeah, I really want a heavier, more connected steering feel, but I doubt they'd announce that sort of thing. "
"I assume this applies to adding your car to a fleet of Uber vehicles that drive while you're at work, not engaging Autopilot while driving an Uber passenger for money. That's just how I'm reading it. "
"Im guessing that wont fly with regulators. You purchase a vehicle, with certain capabilities, you should be free to use it as you see fit"
Let the rent-seeking begin.
"I REALLY don't like that. That's a really fucking shitty precedence to set.

It just feels really scummy to buy a car and know that you can't legally use it for some things...

IMO, this is going to be a shitstorm if they enforce it."
"Lmao

"Sounds like they're launch a test program next year, not selling them to anyone who wants them, and only testing them in a few cities to start with."
">the partnership hasn't even selected a city in which to test the autonomous vehicles. 

I don't see anything about anyone buying a bolt with autonomous features without being part of some small taxi program."
"> The Bolt doesn't even 

The 3 doesn't even exist."
"If advanced autopilot is $5k and self driving is $3k more, the autonomous 3 is really a $43k car.  The bolt isn't playing in quite that range, but I still expect plenty of people who are late to the 3 reservation queue to get 24 month bolt leases while they wait."
"Is it? Starts at $37k. That is $6k cheaper than a Model 3 + $8k autonomous software charge (is it really is $8k for the Model 3, we don't know that yet), but the base prices of the car are similar.

">[**Tesla October 19th 2016 Autopilot 2.0 Conference Call FULL Model 3 Owners Club [33:53]**](http://youtu.be/IZ90J7i_l20)

>>Tesla announces Autopilot 2.0 hardware on all cars starting today, including Model 3. Allows for full level 5 autonomy when software is ready and pushed out to the fleet over time. They expect to demonstrate full autonomous driving from LA to NY by late next year (just in time for Model 3 deliveries to begin). We live in an amazing world.

"True. But for living in a dense part of LA parking on the street is often the only option. Strip malls, grocery stores, etc would have a lot of available night parking+charging potential for people who need would like to pay for a nightly refuel. 

"
Lithium ion batteries actually don't degrade more from partial charges than they do from full charges. 4 quarter charge is the same degradation as 2 half charges which is the same as one full charge. 
"Oh, grandpa."
This announcement is about the hardware needed for level 5...
[deleted]
Which honestly is no big deal. They likely just have to rewrite the software for the new sensors. 
"That is interesting, so people buying a new Tesla don't get autopilot for a while then... that sucks"
They also won't have a Tesla until around December according to the order page right now.
I'm in the same exact boat. I really hope there's an upgrade options for those that help them reach their Q3 goals. :(
"Exactly, and by that time you will be able to get version 3.0 of the hardware."
Such is life. No way they will have a retrofit. They don't have an autopilot 1.0 retrofit. And even if they did it would cost way too much.
i'm ok with it. it's only a 2 year lease.
"> but I feel cheated

How so?

- Rumors of AP 2.0 were easily findable.
- Model 3, Part 2 has been rumored to be within ~6 months of today.
- Tesla's spat with MobilEye, and their need for an ASAP replacement, is common knowledge in the community.
- Finally, you bought it with the knowledge that while the car does get regular software updates, there was no precedent for a major hardware upgrade. (See AP 1.0 cars vs. Pre-AP cars)
"
There we go.  Nice.
A thanks. There were ether caching issues or the site hasn't been updated yet the time I looked.
So how do you buy a Bolt when the Model 3 has this?
And my wrench
"It will probably at least have Autosteer+ which will allow the car to more safely take sharper corners. Hence the ""enhanced"". This will include a better auto-summon and On-ramp to Off-ramp. Read here under 'Enhanced Autopilot': https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/autopilot?redirect=no"
"Mercedes has had a completely self-driving S-class prototype for a few years now, and have been testing self-driving trucks as well.  Audi has been working with various companies and had a Q5 (I think) testing cross-country trips completely hands-off.  BMW has been toying with self-driving cars in all sorts of ways as well, most notably the self-drifting toy they made.  Even GM is in the game, they've actually been testing self-driving Bolts on their corporate campuses and are expanding to testing on public roads.

Everyone is in the self-driving car game, Tesla is just going about it differently."
"The difference between everyone else and Tesla is that Tesla can charge for an unfinished system today.

But people wouldn't pay $5.000 more for a Chrysler if it might get an autopilot ""some time in the future""."
"Of course they have. But they let themselves get caught up in the red tape. As a result, Tesla is going to be first to market with autonomous tech, and everybody else is now playing catch up."

I wonder if it's tri cameras front and rear and side cameras.

"They won't. Driver attention will still be required for a very long time here in Germany I am sure. Even without pressure from the local manufacturers.

Apart from that I do not understand how parking is supposed to work. In a lot of places around here parking is more of an art (and often requires a parking ticket anyway). Meaning parking spots are not clearly designated. Or blocked for construction with a simple one-off sign or parking in a spot is only allowed for residents etc.
Great that the car can do this, but the driver will still have to sit inside and decide."
Yes they are. They're hidden within the Design Studio.
"Of course, I was thinking of current customers who would have to decide whether to get the working system or the better one that would still need (weeks/months/half year) to work.

BTW, I don't remember this, was Autopilot 1.0 already on the horizon before the announcement for activation?"
"That's exactly what it says in the description on the web site, actually:

> When you arrive at your destination, simply step out at the entrance and **your car will enter park seek mode, automatically search for a spot and park itself. A tap on your phone summons it back to you**"
"definitely. but having to drive a expensive car with those crucial things missing even for a few months is risky, right?"
"It's Tesla, be prepared to wait several months or more."
"""Will post video of a Tesla navigating a complex urban environment shortly. That was what took the extra couple of days."" - Elon Musk"
"I get what you're saying, but don't fully agree. It's not a big issue by any means, but the loss of basic safety features due to impact of the software roll out schedule is still something that will be considered by some. It won't be a problem for early adopter types, but those who were looking at the tesla as an EV vehicle with excellent safety features may put off purchasing it for a little while until those standards return again with the 2.0 hardware.

Bottom line is, if tesla is making sure all future production vehicles include AP 2.0 hardware as standard, then they are in essence forcing anyone purchasing a tesla from this point forward to be an early adopter of AP at the cost of lost safety features in the immediate term. Some people may be put off on that if no basic timeline is provided on when the features will return.

A relatively small group of people, hopefully. But it's not zero."
If he is saying they are about to post a video showing a current S navigating a complex area then they already have the software too. They are just waiting for validation of the code and regulatory sign offs. If that is all true this is five years ahead of anything I thought possible.
"A year today is a very very short time, man...."
If they don't have the software how is elon going to post a video of a car navigating an urban environment 
"We never/don't have the tech for a mere $8k though, especially to ""see"" in all weather conditions. This will be incredible if true. "
"We had the capability in theory, but never in a production car until now. "
"Well, Musk basically said he fixed that. Or at least that is what I read."
"They say there will be a coast-to-coast demo drive at the end of next year. If that's just the demo drive, I don't know how close it is for the end user."

"It is saying that you are disallowed, via your agreement with Tesla, from using your purchased car as a commercial vehicle, specifically in ride sharing services.  As of now, I know of no car company that limits their customers' intended future use of their vehicle."
"They have to do this though. If they don't put this out there you are giving Uber or lyft the ability to walk in buy 1000 of these and steal a billion dollar industry away from you through your own product. Now for the individual consumer hopefully they have another solution of some sort. At this point we are no longer talking about a mechanical machine you own, there is a whole network that will power those abilities that Tesla will keep up. You generating revenue off that is going to be expected to be ""shared""."
"They probably have the snake bot figured out now, or nearly. The expectation is that they will be completed and deployed before the end of next year at supercharging stations."
Speed of light is pretty quick. You can time division multiplex many radar units and still have a good update rate.
I've seen that I was just expecting they announce it on a live stream. 
"Yes, that was my question, how well would the cameras handle measuring the speed of incoming high speed cars from behind. Also, would they put them in the side view mirrors to get a better angle? could they put radars inside the side view mirrors (I know they probably wont)? It will be interesting to see the answers to all of this when they come"
Redundancy. 
just came back.
We are talking about the design studio right?
"True but I don't see the partnership diminishing. I'm fairly confident the PX-2 will be in all new vehicles, the coincident nature of the announcements and behind the scenes over they years is too much to ignore for me."
"I'm well aware of the convex mirror. I checked this morning on my commute how far back I was looking out for vehicles and it was roughly 200-300 meter (there are certain markers with a defined distance to each other that you can count). However the speeds where not that high, so it could be more in other situations.

A minimum speed to switch lines is not feasible when you get stuck behind a truck and can't get to those speeds without changing the line first.

In situations like these, e.g. you are stuck behind a truck on a two line Autobahn, I spend a decent amount of time looking in the back view mirror to be absolutely sure no one is coming any time soon.

A Delta v of 50 m/s seems extrem but they are really not that uncommon, especially when spending a lot of time on the Autobahn.

To be clear, I'm not saying the Tesla can't do this! I have no idea what the camera range is for mere detection of other vehicles. The 100m might just be the range where the camera can gather precise information. It's not like everything beyond 100m is virtually not existing for the system.

But when the detection range of vehicles is in this area there might be real issues here."
I'm talking about the Rearward Looking Side Cameras with 100m range. The Rear View Camera has only 50m range. 
"So the cameras used by other companies have been of much lower quality than Tesla's, thus requiring LIDAR to supply more information? Or will the new system just have better hardware for image processing?"
"I have seen those also, and they are indeed *ugly*. My understanding was that they are outfitting LIDAR sensors to a car that is not built with them, right? I imagine Tesla's vehicles would have built-in, inconspicuous LIDAR sensors (such as the rest of their sensors)."
I wouldent be schocked.

I didn't know that the interior had been released yet!?  link please
"Depends on country maybe another country in Europe with more flexible or agile regulatory body approved the ""trial"" like they did to Volvo."
Or they can give the consumer the option of breaking the law by using it.
Really? The only thing? I love tesla but I'm having a tough time believing this thing can navigate Manhattan streets.
"Ya, if it's just regulations then I don't see a problem.  They could continue to say it's capable, but not allowed.

What I'm wondering about though is if they're wrong and it's missing something (extra camera, extra sonar, extra radar etc).

I'm a huge fan, and investor, so I really wouldn't want this to happen, but it could in theory.

Edit: E.G.  Regulators+testing could find that the car has a massive blind spot in such a such a scenario, and therefore isn't allowed anywhere in the world until this new sensor is added since it can't be solved with software."
fingers crossed!
"Hell yeah, if that is a thing then sign me up!"
"u/FredTesla, update the post with this. Also the video demo when Elon shares it. "
thanks!
Doh :(
"I think /u/Raysor was asking about ""flow-of-traffic"" speeds specifically. Generally speaking, it's common knowledge to drive about the same speed as everyone else - for example, if the speed limit is 55 but everyone's going 70, you traveling at 55 could actually be dangerous - so, despite being *technically* illegal, it will be interesting to see if the system is programmed to break the speed limit in the name of increased safety or not."
Same software API and stuff used. Mostly the training of the AI.
"I wouldn't say that the trip could be done completely on Level 3, maybe Level 4 though. Level 5 means that the car should be able to handle literally any scenario it gets thrown into, so on a pretty ""tame"" route like LA to NYC, Level 4 will probably cut it."
Ah good. It's really amazing how much progress Tesla has been making 
"its a blog post on Tesla.com, youre not gonna find a live stream"
This is huge information. Not an event.
"Oh, no sorry. I meant I'm waiting for the Model 3 at this point."
Nissan are already committed having fully automated cars for under $30k by 2019/20. They may not beat Tesla to have mass market production but unlike others they are well down that path.
"> They have to get real world data in order to calibrate.
> It will be available by December

They have the high precision map data from APv1. But TACC doesn't need any of that. It's just not done."
"that's like a good philosophical concept and stuff, but there's too many corner cases.  At least until computers have better learning than humans, i don't think it will happen.  There's a difference between just believing in the potential of the future, and the actual engineering required to get there"
"Yeah, he talked about robust redundancy being necessary in a fully self-driving car but I didn't see any information about it being the case today, apart from the cameras. I doubt the cars are coming off the line with two Nvidia supercomputers already..."
But I'm talking about a situation where the car is in full self-driving mode and you're not expected to be able to take over. You could even be sleeping.

I don't think the HOLY SHIT commenters do...
It'd be more accurate to say they're homophones since they're spelled differently.
"Yeah I guess so, but I also follow motorsports and I see this little error  every day now, which is a recent phenomenon. Words have meaning, after all, it's important that they're used correctly. The other one I see all the time now is people using ""apart"" when they really mean ""a part"". Those things have literally the opposite meaning."
"Well, in fairness I don't think their press releases are written by their engineers. I'd expect anyone to be working for Tesla to have encountered the word brakes before though.


It occurred to me later that maybe Elon dictated the post through software and proof reading missed it. Who knows."
You're implying the difference between $35k and $45-$47k isn't significant?
Good point.  I hadn't yet thought about what this would do to the cost of my Model 3.  I really hope that Tesla's vision is realized.  I think it would end up being worth 20% of my overall purchase to have the car drive itself while I napped.
Someone in this thread posted a link to the Autopilot order form - maybe when configuring a Model S/X?  
"He needed refining to set up a demonstration of this new Autopilot navigating complex urban environments. ""Will post video of a Tesla navigating a complex urban environment shortly. That was what took the extra couple of days."" - Musky Elon"
"Neural nets, especially at the scale of even AP 1.0 driving, would require far more computing power than the AP 1.0 cars have available."
"I know, but once the software is available, your car just transforms into a driverless car, no need to wait. One day you have one of the best cars out there and the next, you have the uncontested best car ever made."
Good luck out-refining Tesla now that Jobs is dead.
"Eh, they kind of were with GUI and mouse and iTunes and iPhone and App Store and others. Sure, maybe not *first* first, but it's certainly not like they had a competition with Tesla's marketshare doing the same exact thing, when they launched those products.

And technologies in all of them later became industry standards. (I'm not saying we wouldn't have them without Apple, but Apple totally brought them to mass market first.)"
"I was assuming lidar would be a 3rd redundancy for detection before autonomy, hope that govt doesn't require it"
"My understanding is that all Teslas ship with autopilot hardware, enabling it is a payment for the software - at time of ordering, or after delivery."
Youre right. I just got overly excited. 
I think think this will prevent many injuries and fatalities.   I am ready!
"Totally, I can understand why lidar-only isn't a viable option, but since Tesla is already going with multiple inputs (cameras and radar), lidar seems like it could only help provide more data. Are there times when having the extra data from lidar would do more harm than good?

I realize it's an additional cost, both hardware and software, I'm more talking about down the road when the costs have continued to drop and range has continued to improve. Is AP 3.0 likely to have lidar added to the mix?"
Nor are the laws
"Ok, thanks for the link!  That answers it."
Well then it will be moving quite slowly anyway.
"Man, that's a lot... This model 3 is going to be so expensive :/"
"What does ""shortly"" mean"
"I don't know why I was expecting the Model 3 to have that included in its $35K base price.  I imagine I'm not alone, though.  $43K for a car is a lot -- I know I'd be getting a lot, including assumed safety, but it's still a lot."
But what about the 3K already paid for the regular autopilot. Would the added cost for both be 5K then?
"But doesn't that contradict their statement that ""...all Tesla vehicles produced in our factory – including Model 3 – will have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability...""? Maybe the extra package will simply enable the extra cameras, but the configurator option seems like it indicates that it is a physically different amount of cameras"
"Ah, gotcha. "
Agreed.  Can't believe the shortsightedness.
I've been in meetings all day. Thanks!
"Thanks for the info. It just seems odd that that info wasn't put in plain text for people to read and understand in Tesla's statement, almost like forgetting to simplify things for ordinary readers."
"Wow. My God I can in no way afford a Tesla, but I'll be buying one as soon as they release a VW Camper type of thing. That could give me the freedom and the lifestyle i've always wanted."
What's obvious is that you misunderstand how the technology works
"Huh.. Nothing is being 'pulled out', it's being replaced with a newer and better system, which was the plan all along.. 

Your theory would make sense if they killed AP on old cars, but they're not doing that."
You seem to have trouble reading.
"Well, I'll need to read more about it since it's not super obvious to me"
"Aw well that explains it 😂 
I guess when Elon tweeted that it started at 5 I just assumed! 

Thanks, I'll stop refreshing YouTube now. 😂"
Interesting. I wonder if the law requires someone to be in the driver's seat. 
if it's the same hardware it's must be really close to this price... camera is a camera and the nvidia computer will be as powerful as now to be able to be fully autonomous...
"Wow, that would be incredible.  Do you know if they also mentioned when they are going to introduce the interior ?  I'm so excited !"
"Motor, not engine.

"
"Slashdot was born at my school, and I've quit visiting as well.  Sad to see what happened to Rob and Nate's project after they left."
">Elon said in the press call that Autopilot 1.0 will continue to improve.

Thrilled to hear that. I'm in a place where I could replace my Model S with a new one equipped the way I want, but it would be a monumentally stupid financial decision. It's nice to know I'll still get some benefits and upgrades.

>Interesting question about the performance. We would probably be more comfortable if the car doesn't erratically accelerate and take sharp concerns although from a safety point of view having fast acceleration to move out the way is still nice.

I wonder if there will be fewer people wanting the P100D if they're not the ones driving it most of the time. A 75D would be sufficient for most of my range issues, but I want a 90D (or 100D) for the performance boost it gives. Maybe now I care less about that.

>re: senior mobility

We could put the senior in the front seat if they're a licensed driver, for legal reasons.

"I'm pretty sure the video showed the car on freeways and other non-private property. The difference is that there was a human at the wheel with their hands visibly ready to take control, so from a regulatory standpoint that mode of operation is akin to current (legal) AP features."
I ordered in June and have been jerked around because I ordered grey seats and solid white paint. Apparently it's going to happen before Christmas. 
didn't bosch provide the radar tech for AP 1.0?
"When will we find the cost adder for full autonomy to a model 3? We can probably guess from a Model S or Model X order.

Current cost is $3500."
"I would imagine when a high enough portion of cars adopt autonomy i would imagine that traffic speeds could easily increase. 

I feel US highways easily have straights that are a mile or more in length. Certain scenarios where you may be able to see further.  It seems to be plenty of room for the car to slow or stop, i just thought it might be jarring.  Maybe there will be a max speed for it, idk"
Where are you getting that 614 feet number. That is really long even from 80 miles an hour.
It was between Nvidia and AMD
"Huh, interesting. That's what I always thought too. I didn't even know Intel was in the conversation. I only asked this because of hearsay. I know this is irrelevant to the story but it's cool to know what I heard wasn't completely off base."

"Where does it say that? I think they mean if you have one in production and didn't buy AP, you can add it."
"Thanks - I must have just been reading AP 2.0 rumors and such over the last couple months and assume they had actually implemented the hardware already.
"
It means that all cars coming off the line have the hardware. You pay extra to activate it.
"yeah, but the difference here is that Tesla will be spearheading the regulation issues. It's not like Toyota/GM/Ford will want anything passed in the near term as they need to catch up. So wouldn't it be advisable to not purchase 'Full Autonomy' upon delivery considering the risk?"
"Well, bugger"

But it could be years until it's done and even then years until your state approves it. You could be on a different car by then.
"OK. Lemme try again: there are only so many google mapping cars. If I am captured walking by one of them, so what? 

Tesla however wants to sell a million cars by 2020 (? Forget the exact year).  Each one of them a roving omnidirectional camera.  Each car has a data connection to Tesla HQ (currently used for ota software updates).  As processors get faster, facial recognition will be easy to do on the car itself.

How long do you think it will take for each car to be on
 constant lookout for FBI's to ten, or Snowden, or perhaps just randomly recognizing people on the sidewalk for future use, just in case...

The retort that google could do this as well fails on the first point - walking to the store I often pass a Tesla.  I never pass a  google map car.

"It's great news, to be sure, but I'm not convinced that it needed to be announced. The system still needs to gather more data and get regulatory approval, so nothing will effectively chang in the near future. I think it would have been better to gather the data first then make an announcement that the features will be turned on. To me, this all points to this being a hasty backup announcement (note the spelling errors). Glass half full: the originally intended product is still out there to be revealed! "
Could be - it seems anti-climatic and doesn't seem like a new product. And saying that you have the hardware ready for full autonomy is a little suspect - until you have achieve full autonomy you don't know. 
"yes.
but this announcement would have made sense also without  Model3. I want specific info about model3. I want to know how I would be able to drive this car without AP2.0. any HUD etc.. "
I don't think it counts until it's enabled.

I think they mean upgrade for cars in production.

"Both are somewhat tricky, actually.  I'm going to guess here, but this likely means the cameras and associated image recognition firmware is in good shape.  That means what you get ""out"" of the camera isn't so much just a picture, but also location of cars, road edges, people, etc.  The ""software"" then takes over and based on the locations of all those items the camera has identified, decides what to do with the steering wheel and gas and so on.

Even getting the camera/firmware done (which I think they're implying) is a big step.  I'd say it's likely just as much work to get the camera and image-recognition part done as it is to do the top level software for decisions.  It's not just as simple as installing new firmware, since the firmware will have to run image-recognition fast enough to handle a driving environment, and that isn't simple.  "

N... No, once again, the old cars with AP will work fine, it's not being shut off. Please don't just completely make stuff up :/"

"The radar saw it and thought it was an overhead sign. The camera couldn't differentiate it from the sky.

Lidar meanwhile can spot pedestrians behind light tree cover and through car windows. And importantly, can tell the difference between an overhead sign and a truck.

Lidar can pick out features of objects. Radar can only say ""There is a metal thing this far away of approximately this size."" unless you're using millimetre wave stuff. Which I'm assuming they're not, otherwise the radar would have said ""Truck."" not ""Truck-sized blob, probably overhead sign."""

"So.. by Elon's words, this website is killing people."
Are they for serious?
"Right, that's exactly what I meant by ""this will be more difficult to measure"".  But it's exactly what's needed to convince others that the product is safe."
">How does that compare to apple?  Apple doesn't want to integrate with others. 

It's especially interesting given that the rumors are that Apple abandoned its car project specifically to work on an autonomous driving package that it sells to other OEM. 

If that rumor is true, not selling to other automakers would be the LEAST Apple thing about the announcement. :)"
"I interpreted it as full autonomy will be released in December, with updates rolling out quarterly. (Not in years.)"
"The best I can give you is....35 dollars.

You know, it's a nice piece and all but it will be sitting in here a long time before the right buyer walks in, and I need to make a small profit. "
You got to bite the bullet at some time. It's only going to keep getting better and better. 
"No reason to wait anymore.  My interpretation of the announcement is that all cars leaving the factory from now on has the new hardware, I believe this will also include those who have already ordered but the car has not been built yet."
Why would you hold off now?
But if you buy one now you'll still get this feature though 
"It was prudent to wait for this announcement, but now you're in the clear.  With AP2.0 capable of level 5, I doubt we'll see any major hardware upgrades for quite some time."
Great logic there..
One THOUSAND dollars!
$111
"All these people are insulting you with their low offers, you should sell it to me for $80 out of spite for them."
"The regular safety features would still be included and are listed separately (lane assist, auto braking). It's the extra capabilities you'll have to pay for. 

Tesla has already made the argument that less people will die with it's current autopilot feature, which was also not included for free. No one assumed it should be included for free just because it can save lives. 

Of course, these features are optional now but eventually all cars will have similar technology and it will be included as part of the base package, just as it happened with most security features."
You contradict your original contrarian comment.
"> do you genuinely think that the autopilot will fail more times than a human driver

Yes because the software is written by humans. I think Elon has no idea how long it will take to develop true level 5 autonomy."
"> but do you genuinely think that the autopilot will fail more times than a human driver?

I have no idea. But it's exactly that what they can't prove or provide any data that way.

"
So you are assuming there will be zero accident or what? Or were is your evidence to back that claim up?

"I've never looked into car leasing before, out of interest what sort of term are you locked into with that $1,350 instalment? That's way cheaper than I would've expected for such an expensive car."
Alright I misunderstood then :)
I got tree fiddy 
What do you consider a reasonable offer?

">  I have enough disposable income to easily justify the car 

I think my first impression was different, since I'd assume someone with a lot of disposable income would put down a big enough downpayment that they aren't paying off four figures a month for five years. 

Either way, good for you - I'm an early adopter myself..There's not THAT much difference between you owning that car and the litany of VR shit I've bought :p "
I hope! Im already stretched further than I'd like to be on a car... its just so worth it long term.
"I can't find a source but I remember the same thing. I don't remember if it was during some Q&A or tweet or something, but Elon did say that upgrade options for the model 3 would be cheaper than the model s/x. "
Likely due to the Model 3 being built from start with autonomy as part of the design philosophy.

"Even if it's put into ridesharing mode, the car should be set to come back with at least a 15 minute margin for error, right? You don't want the car to be starting a new fare, which if it's 15 minutes each way, is 30 minutes round trip.

So after a big music show or sportsball game, there'll be a line of Teslas circling & circling, waiting for their masters to return.

Personal cars just can't work for everyone in a high-density area. It's a geometry problem: they're too big, and move too slowly, to move all the people. Just watch a video at Shinjuku station in Tokyo, and imagine every one of those people in a car instead of on the subway. It just won't work. For rural or low population areas, sure, self-driving cars may make good sense, but only a handful of people in high density urban areas will be able to have a car, whether it's self-driving or not.

"Yeah, I figured that out later.  The designer page shouldn't mention the number of cameras.  It makes it sound like you only get two cameras unless you order."
"The main processing board itself could be around 2 grand.  Although that would drop in price pretty fast.  That price would drop in half in 1.5 years, its commodity nvidia graphics hardware.  The rest of the sensors can't be more than 500 bucks.  The radar sensor is going to be the most expensive part and tesla is making their own cameras/sensors to reduce cost.

So you are probably looking at 2.5k in hardware and 5.5k for software and the services behind it.  Which is dirt cheap for what you get.  And in a year it will be 1.5/6.5k and in 2 years 1k/6k, etc.  The price of the hardware is going to only go down until they swap out for higher resolution sensors like lidar(or more radar) and get the latest processing board from nvidia that is 2-3 times as fast."

"Yes. That's what they did with the first version of autopilot. The sensors were put in and the features were announced about a year before Autosteer software came out.

I think it will probably be less 'flipping a switch' and more of a gradual rollout and addition of features like with Autopilot so far.

The biggest advantage of that is now all new Tesla cars (even ones that haven't paid for the Autopilot software) will have the sensors and be mapping streets and training the autopilot software."
"I assume they are going to slowly upgrade software in various stages as it gets developed (and legal approval is gained). 

The first update you will see is upgrading it to around the same standard as the 1.0 autopilot (Level 2). Then an improved, smarter version of that. 

I wouldn't be surprised if it's at least 5 years before Level 3 enabled self-driving software rolls out to the general public and longer again before Level 4/5 software rolls out.

Level 2 requires the driver to take over with basically zero notice.

Level 3 works without any monitoring on certain roads and traffic conditions, but has no hope of reliably completing a full journey. Driver should have lots of time to take over if conditions change.

Level 4 would be fully self-driving. It could drive from Point A to Point B completely empty, pick up passengers, find a car park, drop your kids off at school for you, etc.

Level 5 is basically the same thing, except the steering wheel has been removed. "
"Yes, but that's not full level 5 and it's a limited test deployment. Two humans are in the car at all times, one behind the wheel and another engineer monitoring, plus there are situations where the human driver must intervene (for example to go around a stopped vehicle). 

Selling a Level 5 vehicle to consumers is going to take some regulatory adjustments."
"Oh I think it will all get sorted out, it will just take time. Insurance companies will love it once the statistics start to show reduction in incidents, and the goverment will love it if it can reduce the 35 thousand US road deaths each year.

I would imagine that at some point much cheaper insurance will be one of the many selling points for autonomous vehicles."
"Elon posted they are going to upload a demo video, so software too! The legal system is going to have to figure this out fast!

Edit: the blog post says it will be disabled till vetted, so it's ready but needs tons of validation."
ALSO the software is the hard part.  Hardware for this is pretty easy.
The software is running through a neural net... I think they are going to train it to level 5.
I read that as drunk driving laws and the grey lines of legality. 
"The software needs to be calibrated by driving it (any Tesla, they can communicate over-the-air) several million miles."
"I'm willing to bet basic cruise control works... Adaptive, on the other hand, probably not."
"You get a beta, and you get a beta, and you get a beta!

^(mostly joking, I think this is truly awesome.)"
...yet
"Apparently they are going to show a video of AP navigating complex urban roads, presumably on 'full-auto'. Wouldn't that require nearly complete software? "
"The ""code"" is planned to be sent OTA in December!"
"Code, or part of it at least, is probably there though. They said they'd be posting a video soon demoing autonomous driving in urban setting. It just probably need a ton of data and modifications. 
"
I think the only reason it's delayed release is they are starting with a blank slate neural network and they need info from the new sensors first before turning it back on. 
"I'm not sure I'd say the 'code' isn't done yet.  It sounds like they're waiting for lots of training data for their neural nets, using actual drivers to train their automated systems.  So it might not be human-written code that needs finishing."

Seems crazy doesn't it.
Yeah.. 2 years from not even having adaptive cruise control hardware to having level 5 autonomous hardware.
Haha no way.. the entire car would have to be rewired and the computer systems replaced. I'll just have to wait for my Model 3 :)
"Yeah, it'd be disappointing. But what would you prefer, to wait a few months now or have to buy a whole new car in the future for full autonomy ? I know I'd prefer the former."
So I take this as basically being for full self driving? Like having your car drive to it and charge? Cause I mean is it that hard to get out and charge it yourself?

"Weird- when I first loaded the studio after reading your post, it just showed the old autopilot option.  Now that I reloaded, it shows the new options."
"There's something in there about the computer knowing its limits too. I believe it's level 3 but maybe 4. The computer has to tell you to take over because it is outside of its scope. Tesla does not have that right now with AP 1.

Edit: doing a bit of research I guess I was wrong. What I had read might have been an interpretation of what is actually stated about levels. "
"This reminds me of SpaceX. They have their Falcon 9 rocket, and they released an upgrade called Falcon 9 Full Thrust. What happens if they improve the thrust again? Falcon 9 Even Fuller Thrust?"
"Based on going from 1 camera to 4/8 (It was unclear - even if you select only the 4-camera option, are the other 4 still installed for the sake of data gathering?), I doubt retrofit is possible.  Seems like an even bigger jump from pre-AP to AP; new wiring and hardware needs to be installed throughout the car.  And in this case new computers too."
"> Is the new tech really fully autonomous (meaning, there wont be a 3.0 that does something this one cant do)?

Well, this is a pretty major hardware overhaul. I wouldn't expect any further major AP hardware changes for several years now."

Universal basic income.
Yeah. Automation of jobs could be such a wonderful thing if we structured our society differently... unfortunately capitalistic society is going to mean people will lose jobs and there will be increase in the poor. I'm curious as to what's going to happen when pretty much all of the low wage jobs become automatic.
"More like 50-60 hour work weeks for the repair techs and autonomous software engineers, and no work for the people who just got replaced."
"> Let us all bask in the glory of consumer excess from automation. Its time for the 15 hour work week. 

In a capitalist system this would just mean that lots of people will be struggling to find enough work while a few big companies and their shareholders pocket the savings they make on labour costs. 

An employer has absolutely no incentive to pay you a 40 hour wage if he only needs you to work 15 hours a week - in fact they have an obligation to their shareholders not to. "

I never thought of that... That is a pretty revolutionary idea right there. Wow.
"> This dramatically lowers the true cost of ownership to the point where almost anyone could own a Tesla. 

I think this is cool and all, but if he thinks that this will make the car affordable to almost anyone is nuts. Obviously, the most glaring problem is that most people can't even get a loan for a 70k car.

The good news is that since no driver is needed, just about anyone should at least be able to afford to hail a tesla(well, a more functional and less fancy version of a tesla that's less money. Maybe one that's built just for providing cheap rides). But we will see, there needs to be lots of competition. And honestly I'd rather not have to own and maintain a car anyway. "
"This will only make sense financially in a lease vehicle. The reliability of the car will be truly tested if it is used constantly throughout the day, I certainly wouldn't want a car I personally invested in to have its depreciation rate accelerated like that"

"It's not, the page just updated for me."
"Wireless charging *is* that far along but not nearly at levels you would really want in all use cases. If you send Tessie off on cab duty, it needs to stay in service as much as possible. A wired supercharge is much faster at that than anything we can hope to approach wirelessly at this point. While you're at work, the car can't be spending several hours recharging."
"Wireless charging would cost 2x to 3x in energy costs just because of the poor efficiency. Installing an above ground box that doesn't require retrofitting every single car is a lot less expensive than digging up a ton of concrete under each parking spot and rewiring everything. Not to mention repairing it if it breaks if it's embedded in concrete and adding the hardware to every new car.

I don't see Tesla doing it."

"Large car companies don't develop things internally much anymore. Large car companies are about vehicle aesthetics, ICEs and Assembly technology. Companies have a hard time funding a small group of people to develop something complex and support it from the top to the bottom."
ha! yeah I'm getting that same offer from my coworkers :)
[deleted]
MKBHD is wrong I think. The new hardware has 8 cameras around the car to see in all directions as well as ultrasonic sensors that see twice the distance and a computer with 40 times more processing power. Just the cameras alone sound impossible to retrofit
There's zero evidence to support this yet.
"As much as I would hope, I highly doubt that. Although, from reading that, it would be 7 additional cameras and the CPU, so certainly possible, but not probable."
"I mean, I get it. If they did that you'd have a lot of people holding out for the next thing. 

I intentionally waited a little longer to get a 4th quarter car, thinking they might start doing something new after the 3rd quarter push but they just made mine really fast on the tail end.

Oh well, its still awesome."
"No one is getting these features without paying for them. You would still have had to pay the 8k for the enhanced autopilot and self driving features. At worst you are out an extra 2k on top of that if you want to retrofit it into your car. And I would assume people who's cars are being done now, will have the option to upgrade for the 8k before taking delivery, but no one is just having them put this into their car without paying to do so. Don't feel too cheated; it sucks, but it could be worse."
"I feel the same, I tried to upvote you out of the hole for what it's worth :)

I ordered in July, took delivery mid-September ... so I missed out on all the big Q3 incentives *and* AP2. 

It's a little frustrating to say the least, but I guess I knew what I was getting into- just one of those ""Tesla things"" (tm).

For a car that cost more than my first house to be obsolete in less than a month, it's kind of a bummer.

Here's hoping for a retrofit ... or for me to somehow be able to afford a trade up in a couple years, I guess."
"Why?  It could be years before they turn features on.  They're just in a data gathering phase.  Going from level 2 to level 3 is huge, because for the first time you're telling people they don't have to pay attention to their car while driving.  This means nothing this year, maybe starting to turn a few features on next year, piece by piece.  I'd be very surprised if this was active in any substantial way until   2018 (and 2020 or later isn't out of the question)."
That's only for new cars built with the body to hold the cameras. Old car body's can't be retrofit
That's probably only for cars that have the hardware. It looks like mine does not as it was shipped the week they had the production shut-down.  The only upgrade I have available in My Tesla is to the 75 kWh battery.
"wow. I missed it by a few days then. I ordered on 9/15, got my car last Friday."
"The way I see it, their code is done. They're just waiting on validating that their code works against real world data collected from cars on the road. They can validate currently against a couple of thousand miles that it works but they want to validate against a couple of million miles of driving before they release it to users."
It would be tragic if they weren't so competent. It's brilliant.
Unfortunately this does seem like what happened.  Why else would they remove features in the interim. It will be interesting to see if during this time they no longer offer vehicles with legacy autopilot.
"It's probably just like a ps3 vs ps4. They don't always play the same games because of much improved hardware. It requires a redo, but they still have traffic data that won't change."
Thanks that makes a lot of sense. I feel like this is the perfect blend of finding an engineering and a palatable PR solution. The skeptic in me believes that the event got pushed a couple of days to ensure that it occurs a few minutes before the final presidential debate because Tesla didn't want too much attention on this announcement.
"Curious to see what happens here. Tesla might offer anyone who is being shipped a car with AP2 hardware prior to announcement the new hardware at the old rate. New hardware is $5k ""Enhanced Autopilot"" + $3k ""Self-Driving""."
We can only hope
"The issue is that you can't.  You NEED to have people using the hardware to get the data to build the neural net.  If you start shipping out cars w/ the hardware, someone will find it and announce it.  Much better for them to announce it on their timeline.

However, I agree with you about the cashing of the checks."
"You would be temporarily annoyed perhaps, but obviously over time that would go away.  You would be much more and permanently annoyed if you were in the other situation:  you have a Tesla on the way with 1st gen hardware but 2nd gen is already announced.  Tesla is going about things the best way that can be done.

Edit:  and I know I was being snarky and apologize for that, but you must admit Tesla is doing it the best way they can (other than to somehow keep it under wraps until it is fully functional and then announce it, but that it much more difficult to do)."
"I don't understand, are they disabling existing features, or are you just upset that you don't get then-unannounced features?  

I get that they mention cars with new hardware...but I assume it just applies to the cars they are building today, so it shouldn't affect anyone who already bought one."
"I agree that Tesla is right now the only car manufacturer to get away with this, but my explanation is a bit more optimistic.
In my opinion, Tesla can do this because they have demonstrated again and again their honesty and loyalty to their customers. 
When I heard this I immediately thought it was to make sure the cars were running out with the latest hardware, for the benefit of the consumer.
This is the image they have created for me for acting the way they do. Once you earn people's trust, making buying decisions becomes much easier, since you don't need to consider whether or not the other party is acting in your best interest. This is one more thing that by being 100% coherent despite the effort it costs brings long term value to the company. "
"I understand your point, and of course you are entitled to your own opinion. However I think it is very short term thinking and you're missing the bigger picture. Clearly fleet learning is essential for autonomous driving to be of high quality, and in order for that to be viable they need many millions of miles with the hardware configured. To do it any other way than to ship these out now with the hardware built-in would certainly take many more months and years. If you think about what the additional resale value of an auto pilot 2.0 vehicle versus a 1.0 vehicle, the fact that the 1.0 vehicle will never be able to be fully autonomous as well as the fact that it is likely a very short-term sacrifice of moderately capable driver assist features that will be sacrificed it seems like a no brainer."
"One thing to note is that (at least under my understanding) with Tesla's ordering system you generally haven't actually paid for the car (and signed final purchase contracts) until delivery. Before that you've put down a non-refundable deposit to get the car built.

I can definitely see a case for wanting to refuse delivery and get the deposit back because the delivered car lacks features you ordered."
Then don't buy AP and activate it later.
"Company announced literally the most revolutionary step in automotive for the past century, unlocking potential never before within reach.... People bitch cause certain minor features will have to be safety tested first and will be unavailable for a month or two.

My God. "
"If by ""new owners"" you mean people who recently purchased and so missed out, I mean that it dulls the pain slightly to know there is a $5500 price difference between AP1 and AP2.

If by ""new owners"" you mean people purchasing after today, then I'm not sure what you're getting at."
"No. I want an upgrade path. It's not like they are only putting this in the Model 3 or other future models. It's in a $150k car that still in its first model year. I understand why retrofitting this is a PITA (I work on both engine computers and vision systems for a living), but the value it brings is pretty huge. People who think the $8k cost for new customers is prohibitive don't get it. There are Tesla owners who spend that much on plastic protective films for their paint."
Elon says there's a [Part 3](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/788973638665908224) coming.
But will you really be THAT upset if your car is a few months late.. but drives straight of the lot to come pick you up?
Here's some [info on that](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/18/tesla-quietly-pushes-back-model-3-delivery-estimate-to-mid-2018-or-later.html). Looks like they are still on schedule.
"I feel this, too. This announcement is huge and really exciting. But, a) it's not really a new product as much as an advance upgrade of an existing product, and b) it's not a Model 3 part 2 unveil. An unveiling in my book is the interior and maybe the body design tweaks. I was expecting an announcement from the July ""pencils down"" deadline.

Now, that said... I am super fucking stoked that my next car is going to be able to DRIVE ITSELF!!"
It will move the needle on S and X sales this quarter. Many have been waiting for AP 2.0 hardware
"I disagree.  This is huge for me.

I have been waiting to hear if all 3s will get the full self driving hardware to place a reservation.  Even a 3 is well above the price I want to spend on a car but a full self driving EV justifies a totally different price bracket to me.  

Now I need to start working on the wife about making a reservation."
"Autopilot 2.0 has been teased for a long time.  I think there are many people who were waiting on the updated sensor suite to ""future proof"" their purchase.  This new sensor suite will be the standard for at least the next 3-5+ years."
Yeah...you're in the minority. Lol. 
"

As far as I know there's no laws anywhere that say you can't tell your car to drive to Louisiana, pick up craw fish, then drive back to NY all without a driver. If the car is breaking laws or causing a nuisance owner will probably be responsible but as of now there's no laws that say ""every vehicle must have a driver"""
"The advanced features will most certainly *not* be included in the base Model 3. Autopilot Safety Features will be standard, but Convenience features, now in two different packages (Enhanced Autopilot and Full Autonomy), will be optional. I'm sure it will work the same way as with the S and X."
Correct. No reason to think it will be any different than with the X or S. 
"Yeah I'm quite sure this is the case. They're planning a system where you can add your car to a shared pool of cars that go and autonomously make money using Tesla's technology, that's what they're trying to protect. I'm sure if you're just driving for Uber and happen to have autonomous features enabled they wouldn't care."
"You can, just not with Tesla's software, which they own not you.

John Deere does the same thing with tractor software, and regulators don't do shit."
"I don't disagree with you (in much the same way that I think all hardware that we buy should be open to whatever use we want), but if you buy a product knowing this restriction of said capabilities going into the deal, then I'm guessing it won't be a problem for regulations. We buy products like this already, knowing that we are locking ourselves into whatever restrictions the vendor puts on them, and which the vendor can change with the flip of a bit in the code. 

There is absolutely zero reason a 3rd party ink cartridge can't work in my HP printer, other that the hardware maker has decided to make it so. Same with the kurig pods. As long as Tesla is up front about it, I don't see the issue. The regulator will say ""if you wanted a car that could be your Uber moneymaker, you shouldn't have bought one that explixitely says that you can't do that"".

Fortunately, the market had spoken on such artificial restrictions and rejected them for the most part. But I'm guessing it will be a while before the market turns against tesla on this, especially if the owners can get a cut from Tesla's implementation / network (it isn't like people are that devoted to Uber at this point, especially once something better comes along). 

Also, people are still foaming at the mouth to just get a self driving car... whether they can rent access to it for some money on the side in some unknown future will be an asterisk they ignore on the way to tesla land. "
You don't even know what it entails yet... I would hold judgement.
"Because if against all odds grandma's Tesla crashes and kills its passengers while it's on the payroll, grandma isn't going to have business insurance, and culpability needs to go somewhere. If Tesla is doing this as a shield to their company and the client, I see it in a better light. Just because everyone has the power TO do it, doesn't mean they SHOULD."
"Well I am already getting a little nervous about what this car is going to end up costing me. 

MS Design Studio now shows the full autonomy upgrades as being 8K after upgrades and if its the same for the 3 thats 43K USD or about 56K Canadian just to get a base model with autopilot and NOTHING else. 

Its quickly getting pushed out of my budget to get the car I was hoping for. At these prices I may have to cancel my reservation, hold onto my Volt a little longer and wait for the Canadian dollar to get better or prices to come down. "
They launched the test program 5 months ago.  
"Yes, but you can get adaptive cruise (with full stop capability) in a $20k Honda Civic. 

I'm not just picking on the Bolt, in fact I would probably get one if I could charge at home and especially if it had an equivalent charger network to Tesla, but that doesn't mean it can't be compared to other offerings. Especially when there are so many news articles that talk about how the Bolt is cheaper than the Model 3 by quoting the price after the tax credit.
"
That's fair. But it's also fair to criticize GM for lacking features when they tout about how they are beating Tesla to the mass market
"It does, you just can't buy it yet. "
Neither does the bolt?
The bolt doesn't exist yet either.
Assuming that 8k isn't a loss leader to driving up production to lower that cost for the 3.
Here's some [context](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/58aenz/this_whatever_this_is/d8ywi1h) btw.
"Not level 5, level 4. Level 5 includes removing all human input devices including steering wheel and pedals. "
"But we don't have it enabled yet, it will take some time to get there and for the laws to catch up."
"Before L5, it will help those who refuse to get off the road when they should. It will not be good for those who think they can now drive because of autopilot, making the roads more dangerous."
"It's written and was probably done so a long time ago. According to Tesla they just have to take it through ""verification"". "
"From what I understand, the software is already written, they just need millions of miles driven so the neural network can learn how to avoid accidents. "
"Well it's for around a month and half. On the plus side, your car can fully drive itself eventually. It's like buying the Tesla with autopilot 1.0 back in the day before autopilot was rolled out. "
"It very well may be finalized by the time you receive the car, the delivery dates are in December anyway."
I think that is just the case if you order now. It takes a few weeks to make the car. 
"It'd be less than depreciation on a brand new car. Depending on how much, I'd probably do it."
No problem I clicked on the link in the OP and got an error too.
">Mercedes has had a completely self-driving S-class prototype for a few years now

Er, not really. Mercedes is way behind Tesla is autonomous driving. Not saying they won't ever get there, but they are behind, quite far behind. "
Because they aren't stupid? Why are you guys all so interested in spending money on this now? It's like pre ordering video games.
"The technical details will be interesting to see. Here's how Tesla describes the new functionality:

http://i.imgur.com/LflPP5v.png"
It has the hardware now. They will collect a metric shit ton of data to get to full autonomy (probably next year...?).
[deleted]
We await your autonomous driving solution to hit mass production. 
Can you elaborate 
"I went through both and neither had it, now they do. I bet their cache had to time out. "
"No more risky than most cars prior to 2012, and most cars on the road today."
Lol risky? Every Tesla before Autopilot 1.0 didn't have these features. My 2014 S 60 didn't and most of the cars in the road don't have these features.
"Risky? You want to talk about risky, my car has only two airbags and no ABS! And yet I don't go around crashing and dying in it, because I drive in a reasonable manner. Surely new Tesla owners can do the same for 2.5 months. "
"I too see what you are saying, and you are right some people will hold off until the calibration interval over. Which will be quicker than people think.

Also that being said, these ""Basic Safety Features"" are in no way necessary. Most cars on the road don't have them."
"And probably more fleet learning data... they can navigate a single complex area, but probably not the whole world just yet."
"The thing about autonomous car software isn't that it can't drive under normal conditions. The problem is dealing with weird things that humans process subconsciously and take for granted. It could be something as simple as navigating some road-works, a slow pedestrian, a car not moving in a green light situation, an accident that just happened ahead, meeting situations in tight one-lane roads etc. This is where machine learning and AI comes in and eventually the car will be able to deal with Level 5 autonomy. "
"> navigating a complex area

Honestly complex urban area isn't the biggest issue. It's higher speeds and bad weather conditions which I guess wasn't an issue in California."
"Well, they have some software, just like Google, or Uber, which is good enough for a demo with a driver supervising the car, but the software is not ready for real world deployment. There might still be situations it cannot handle, or it can fail/make mistakes/have bugs. Making the software close to perfect is a huge task and it will take while to get there. "
"It's a Mere $70,000.. a lot of that hardware and r&d cost is built into the price of an expensive car."
"They have the hardware setup, obviously the software has some ways to go yet seeing as it's not rolling out with the hardware. "
"True. But it's coming fast I feel. The more people that drive teslas, the smarter their neural network gets, and the safer and more autonomous the system can become"
"Thanks. Didn't see that tweet.

Yeah I guess as cool as it is, I was hoping for more details of the car itself too. "
lol. He wants that bastard who allowed his Tesla to be taken out of the world to pay.
Absolutely I did!
"I understand your point, but as of now, I know of no car company that offers this type of technology. Especially since this technology is the future of road based commercial transportation. "
"Small difference: You're not allowed to use Autopilot 2.0 in ride sharing.  You're free to manually drive the car.

They can't legally place any restrictions on what you do with the hardware once you buy it, due to first sale doctrine.  They can place licensing restrictions on the software, though."
I disagree.  I own it.  You cant tell me I cant rent it.  There is no legal grounds for them to tell me otherwise and it would not hold.
"I would expect them either in mirrors or perhaps on the side of the body looking back (similar view, but if in future mirrors can be removed legally, doesn't require relocating them).

They should provide essentially the same view as looking into the mirror, which means you have at least the same ability as a human to check for fast moving objects, as long as the software is smart enough to be able to recognize a car behind another car (or through it's windows)."
"Let's say you are waiting to pull into a fast road and you are stationary at a junction. A car approaches at 60mph. That is 27 m/s. That gives the car a few second to determine whether its safe or not to go and this is with a relative speed of 60mph. On a highway where you are cruising 60mph I would shocked if a car overtook you are 120mph and even if it did, theoretically the car would detect it a few seconds before it passed you. "
"There is a really good post on this discussion blog somewhere about LIDAR not being appropriate. If I find it again I can post it. 

Basically LIDAR provides a very high resolution 3D point cloud in good weather conditions. This resolution - literally to the milimeter is not really needed for driving although if you have LIDAR you may as well use it. 

Tesla has made a major recent software breakthrough in processing RADAR - Radar vision - where multiple successive images are used to form a ""coarse"" 3D point cloud that's good enough for it to be a primary sensor for driving. In addition radar works in all weather conditions and Tesla has been able to use bounced signals to detect cars around obstacles. RADA also can use doppler effect that brings additional velocity info to the table. The ""experts"" you mention probably did not have this breakthrough to work with and radar seems to cover what lidar brings to the table. So radar + 360 deg cameras seems to be a valid choice to me.

Teslas have been seen outfitted with lidar probably for r&d so they are well aware of what lidar brings to the table. These vehicles were probably being used to calibrate the sensor suite since lidar has such high precision. Other car companies and college profs are in laboratory mode so may have a different perspective. When Elon says that Lidar is not appropriate in driving context I suspect he knows what he is talking about.

But as I said, there is another post here that is probably more accurate and explains additional issues and tradeoffs around choosing or not choosing lidar as well."
"Could be some confusion. I do know for some things tesla ships the cars with the hardware, but requires you to pay extra to enable the software. This could be the case."
Its not at all done and will change but the speedometer is there none the less http://imgur.com/a/rPTo1
There is no way Tesla will release an app that allows an owner to tell their car to drive across the city without a person inside without a law allowing it.  That just opens up too many areas for a lawsuit.
Clearly you haven't watched NVIDIA AI and self driving car presentations. 
The website mentions it will be unveiled next year
Ah I see! I know that Google's cars learned to drive slightly above the limit as it figured out it was safer that way when interacting with human drivers. I know that's a different situation but it shows that it's capable of learning such a thing by itself! That is a really good question though and I'm assuming they are already working on it! (Hopefully) 😁
Yes that's what I meant
"Are you saying Tesla is using Nvidia API and software? Sorry, just a little confused"
"Saw the post like 2 mins after I asked. Still, I wish it was live :("
I though Elon said he postponed the announcement for a few days because it wasn't ready (the presentation). This is a news blurb?
"I don't think they really plan on it being a system that could completely drive itself as soon as 2018. Just the regulatory hell required to do that is unimaginable. They plan on doing it in levels. They employ machine learning to allow the software to make itself slightly better, kilometer by kilometer.  Software updates will probably be very common in the first years, and slowly but surely, it'll get better."
You don't need two supercomputers. Lets say the main computer shuts down. The entertainment computer (which works with autopilot 1.0) can temporarily take over and pull the car over to stop. Also there hasn't been any mention of the Nvidia computer being in used and I'm wouldn't be surprised if they are not considering they cost $10k each. An internally designed computer is probably cheaper and easy to make redundant. 
"Yeah, it's not a big deal, but it just makes me wonder. If a company lacks quality control for things that are public-facing, does it also lack quality control for things we don't see? Maybe not, but I question even small businesses when they make such obvious oversights as this, much less enormously significant companies like Tesla."
/s
"It's an achievement and milestone, yes.  But cameras and radar weren't the challenge, the software was.  Yes,   it makes 2016-2019 Tesla's more valuable in that the hardware is there, but that doesn't mean there'll be a giant gap among OEMs when the software gets there.  

Tesla has a healthy lead at the moment.  But don't think no one else is working."
"LIDAR is great but overrated and over spoken about by the media and others. It has great limitations, what the LIDAR can't see through fog/rain/snow a camera can't also see. "
They don't. See order page. 
"If you want full self driving, yeah"
"A retrofit has not been announced, but it may be that all current orders have transformed the Autopilot option into the Enhanced Autopilot option."
"It does. The configurator says that the self-driving option ""doubles the number of active cameras from four to eight, enabling full self-driving in almost all circumstances"",

At a guess, their statement means that all currently-produced vehicles will be *compatible* with full self-driving, not that it can be enabled purely via a software update.

It is somewhat ambiguous though, and seems contradictory without more information."
"True, but it does feel like the kind of thing they should give people a heads up on, even if an improvement, I can't imagine this ""pull the rug out from under what people have already ordered"" thing will always go over great with a less forgiving gen-pop crowd.

When they did the facelift everyone who had a car in the queue just got it, which is cool for most, but what if you didn't like it? You ordered one thing and got something that looked completely different."
There's still the demo of the self driving features that's coming out soon.
He is going to post a demo video of it driving around a city shortly.
It does.
"The hardware costs are negligible. You're paying for the right to use the system. It's the same strategy they use with the battery upgrades (you pay to unlock the extra capacity). In economics we call this price differentiation (actually, ""price discrimination"", but it has a negative connotation)"
"No, I have no idea when the third part of the Model 3 announce will happen. In any case I'm really excited too!

Woah, thanks for the gold, I didn't expect that"
"You make good additional points. I think the main advantage of the P100D is of course the range. However, it's nice to to have the performance boost. Some people will not want to activate autopilot all the time. It's nice to have the performance under the hood when you feel like letting go. "
"Ah that's interesting then. If you paid for Autopilot but won't be getting the convenience features until December because of their own production delays, that raises the question of whether Tesla will provide it free of charge due to their delays or not."
"Yes hardware and drivers, and AP 2.0 still has the radar."
"Nope,  that's in addition to the Enhanced AutoPilot cost."
"You have to think about horizontal and vertical curves.  There are highways with significant length without curves, but like I said, a camera with longer range would have diminishing returns, especially if it caused a reduction in shorter range resolution.


It will be somewhat of a jarring stop, but it probably won't be the maximum deceleration of the car."
"A table in my textbook (Principles of Highway Engineering and Traffic Analysis by Mannering and Washburn).  The table is sourced from AASHTO (A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets 6th Edition) and uses a deceleration rate of 11.2 ft/s^2.  This is for design, so it is purposefully conservative as most cars (including Teslas) can probably stop faster than that.

Another interesting note is that curves (horizontal and vertical) are (supposed to be) designed in order to allow a human to perceive an object and stop in time.  As this is a function of driver eye height (in order to see over a hill), the safe speed for a tesla is likely to be higher as the cameras are higher than the driver's eye.  Although Tesla can't/shouldn't use the assumption that all curves are designed this way, they can still use the equations to determine what their safe speed is if they have the data on the curve properties."
"[That's what I read up on here](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/530276/hidden-obstacles-for-googles-self-driving-cars/).  I'm not sure if they have expanded their maps since then, but basically the tech they are pursuing different from Tesla"
Right but for all we know it also applies for all post refresh cars. I don't beleive they had a huge production brake except their usual after quarter 1 week shutdown.
"So the description about the cameras mean you have them and can't use them?!  I hope so, because then you can then activate later. It's not phrased that way, though. "
What risk? You still can't legally drive 155 mph or use Summon on the roads even now.
$8000 for Full self driving.
"It won't be years until the state ""approves"" it. From what I understand (based on the press Q&A), Tesla will develop the software in strict accordance with the federal guidelines on self-driving tech every step of the way. Theoretically, there should never be a situation in which bureaucracy drags out the tri-monthly software update process."
"I agree.  What about ""the hardware is ready"" needed two more days for refining?  

They wanted something bigger, bought two days, and still couldn't say it."
"True, but does anyone else have the hardware on their cars either? "
We already get blue-balled by Elon enough as it is lol
"Yes.



It is very low volume, and the price won't change too much until the trading floors open tomorrow.  There is a reason why companies have announcements after hours, it is to prevent large market swings as information is released."
"Good points..but firmware can be updated, no?"
It is a titan.  Just heard him say it on the call. 
yes sorry corrected

"Now I get it :D I don't think the autonomy will be so ""full"" that you'll have to worry though.."
"You know you can charge the car reasonably quickly on the days you drive more than 200 miles at a time...

If you drive more than that like every other day, this might not be the car for you. The whole mission of Tesla is to not use gasoline engines, so that's why you're getting the downvotes."
"The point is that it's a 100% EV, that the point of Tesla. If 215 mi isn't enough then get a bigger battery pack."
What is it you think they are asking their customers to do?
"If self driving is proved to be more safe than human driving, where's the problem? Even that, I think we won't have the laws for self-driving in 3-5 years, i can't imagine any country would ban human drving before 2030 or so."
"Navigate itself?  

I have no idea.  That's probably one of the harder things to program.  On the flip side, the car could probably see the road better than the driver."

I imagine the costs of finalizing and safety-testing a snake system are pretty substantial; Tesla will want to roll it out widely (albeit gradually) once it's ready for primetime. 
It's soon going to get to the point when lawmakers realize that the human in the driver's seat is the leading if not exclusive cause of accidents in all self-driving car cases.
Doesn't Google's self-driving car drive without a driver?
"Fortunately for your employer you have the Dunning-Kruger effect backing you up. Everyone thinks everyone else is a shitty driver. Obviously only some people are good drivers, but you can easily leverage that almost universal belief that everyone is a shitty driver to promote acceptance of autopilot driving."
"Don't forget the ""It only worked because they carefully mapped out that route and only that route.""
"
I for one welcome our new AI overlords 
Snaaaaaaake
From a year ago...do you remember what autopilot looked like a year ago?
Unless the car could perfectly line itself up every time you'd need a snake charger anyways. 
"No, this was a garbage hit piece by a technology illiterate. In terms of obstacle avoidance and navigation, this is super complex. And it nailed it. You are wrong, there are motivations behind the article. "
You can't really classify apple as anything but what they are until they actually change.  I don't see them partnering with another car company to create a car that takes realtime updates like a tesla.

>The CEO said the new hardware suite will not offer Autopilot capabilities on par with the old hardware suite at first, but it will be similar after a few months of software improvements. By early next year, it should start to be better than the current Autopilot and of course, that’s through over-the-air updates.

>It will reach level 3 autonomy in the coming months and level 4 and 5 should follow for full autonomy by 2018 – but again, in vehicles produced today in 2016.

I see that as restored functionality by march.  Level 3 by the end of 2017.  And level 4/5 by the end of 2018.  That is without any slippage and just for the initial release.  This stuff is going to come in pieces.  You would expect highway/interstate functionality before urban.  You would expect it will take time once fully featured to truly stabilize."
Not true unfortunately. The new AP 2.0 will reach the capabilities of AP 1.0 by December. They have to do software validation etc

I know; but the Tesla was just a recent idea. 
"agree. there will always be something new and more exciting down the pipelines. no need to wait, they are all great cars."
#leasemasterrace
yes but automation is a significant improvement over assisted driving
It won't have the hardware the cars will have a year from now. This is the gamble with waiting.
"i get it, but i want to see how the self-driving mode shakes out. again, i'm in no rush, this just changed things up for a nd gives me more time to enjoy my f pace over the winter."
"? if you're talking about the price, that's tl not the concern; wanted something fast, and electric appeals to me, so why not have something that can drive me around reliably in a few months for a bit extra than get something cheaper now. I can wait."
"One thousand one, Bob. "
"> The regular safety features would still be included and are listed separately (lane assist, auto braking). It's the extra capabilities you'll have to pay for. 

Yes I understand that.  We're talking about the debate of authorizing full level 4 and 5.

Current autopilot feature didn't require special regulatory approval.  It's still classified as a fancy cruise control and lane assist tool.  

The real difference is that autopilot isn't running in the same kind of shadow mode that they are talking about now where the system will give Tesla hard stats on if the car would have reacted to save lives where humans did not."
"You misunderstand me.

I agree it's a contrarian argument.  I'm not saying I agree with that angle, but that public/press/government regulatory bodies could."
[deleted]
"> they can't prove or provide any data that way.

they can definitely provide some data, like if collision prevention would have activated in a case where the driver did nothing, or if the autopilot would have braked but the driver swerved instead, etc.  It won't be 100% complete and perfect but it's not nothing."
"They 100% can provide data that way. As far as I know, every autopilot / self driving car incident where the car has been even arguably at fault has stemmed from an error in detection, not in executing maneuvers after identifying them. This allows them to measure the car's consistency at detecting potential accidents and planning actions, thus testing for the wide majority of likely failures."
">can't imagine (having the money to) pay that much for a car.
Yeah holy shit. My house payment is like 1/3rd that. Just thinking about a monthly payment that high is making my stomach turn. "
"Well, he says he owes slightly less than 76k on it so he's got approximately 55 months left on the financing assuming 0% financing.  Wouldn't be much more than that even with 1-2% financing."
[deleted]
"Money is cheap right now.  With auto loans rates at ~2%, there are way better things I could be doing with my money instead of paying down my auto loan  :)

You're 100% right though.  If it's a a financial burden, folks **definitely** shouldn't incur the high depreciation inherent in buying the new fancy tech."
"But now, since the car already comes with the hardware regardless, you don't need to buy this immediately. You can buy the car, and just buy the autopilot at a later date with a software update.

I wouldn't be surprised if this is how Elon plans to capitalize on the model 3 either. Sell the car as cheap as possible and then make a lot of money from irresistable software updates. They could even have like 1 month free trials and such to really make owners feel the need for the updates."
"He said ""I'm guessing"". He doesn't have a source. It's pure speculation."
"It will be interesting, especially with the 3, if this becomes a thing"
Yes. Or pay lods of emony
"Yeah it is pretty cheap.  In comparison,  [here's a $320,000 Prisus](https://www.fastcompany.com/3025722/will-you-ever-be-able-to-afford-a-self-driving-car)  that can drive itself."
Yep. You can't get the FSD without the EAP. So 8k total for both or 5k for just EAP
Yes. The hardware probably costs little compared to the software.
It's also sounds like they will be using data gathered from all the cars equipped with it for analysis. So all cards can help make it better but only those who pay for the feature can use it to drive for them
Ford: Pass the toilet paper please
"You mean the other companies that are putting more money and resources into automomous car research?

Timelines at tesla don't mean anything. They couldn't even get this reveal done on time..."
"I thought about this a lot. The car is usually the second highest cost point for an average household, after the house itself. 

As soon as we all can download the Tesla app and summon a car whenever we want, people will give up their own vehicles quicker than you can say ""combustion engine"". 

I think the automotive industry as a whole is still in denial. 

Obviously there will still be a market for owned cars, but I strongly believe that the vast majority of drivers today would save the cost of owning, running and maintaining a car in a heartbeat. "
"> The rest of the automotive industry will collectively shit their pants and move up their autonomous research like right now

Their first reaction is most probably going to be sabotage.
"
[deleted]
Of course. That's implied.
"What I imagine is they have ""full fidelity"" in a local neighborhood.  It's capable to do it, but only in their test area.  To get full coverage, they need many, many Tesla drivers to drive all over the coverage area to collect the necessary data.  I imagine the next step would be to open up full autonomy in certain areas they have coverage for, then full autonomy everywhere.

They can target states that are amenable to self driving cars, like NV. "
http://tesla.com/autopilot -- good demo video here.
"That's the beautiful part - from today, no-one has to worry about their car being obsolete in a couple of years and watching everyone else get autonomous cars. So there's no reason to hold off on buying a Tesla."
"Ahem... Yeah... ""Easy"" now that 20 years of digital cameras and other sensors have matured. 

Autonomous vehicles are relatively new and far fewer global r&d hrs have gone into the software relative to the hardware needed to make it happen. 

So the better way to say it would be ""the software is far less mature than the hardware for self driving cars""."
"The software is less hard now. Because they arent writing the software. They are using machine learning to make this a thing. They will roll out the hardware, capture all of the data from tens of millions of miles they then can use the times the car needs the driver to take over to train the car as to what to do in unique situations. You can bet your ass this thing is recording and transmitting even when not in autopilot.
Their system can use every crash, every fender bender, and every near accident as a method to teach the entire swarm instantly. They get multi exponential levels of learning far beyond what any other simulated data set can do."
"Not really, the hardware Google uses in their car (LIDAR) is like $90K just for the sensor. And it only works in good weather, throw in some rain and its totally useless. I'm not sure what hardware Tesla is using for its ""fully autonomous"" auto pilot but there's no way it's going to be cheap and work in all weather conditions. 

Edit: plus that whole comment about the ""updated radar"" being able to work in rain,  fog, ect just screams bullshit. That basically defies the laws of physics in how radar/vision systems work. 

I love Tesla, and whole heartedly want them to succeed but these claims of fully autonomous driving in the next couple months, to me, are just incredibly optimistic. "
"Time to guess on the time frames. 

Current autopilot capabilities. 3 Months

Fully autonomous.  9-12 months. This will be capability. Earlier for highway, later for New York. 

Drive me home, I'm drunk. 3 years in legality.

Edit: Just noting that the self-driving capability will be a $3k upgrade on top of autopilot at $5k in the Model S design studio now. I assume they won't waste time at that cost. "
I imagine it will be in a controlled location with little no none people walking around and with pristine traffic markings.
My mistake it was 1 billion miles to leave beta. This was what he suggested would be needed to gain regulatory approval. I wasn't suggesting autonomy wouldn't be ready sooner. 
"Nope, just that of the car :) and if they'd had two cars, it would be the same amount of traffic but even more load on parking spaces. "
However you could just share a huge pool of cars with everyone living in the same city and whenever you need to get to work or drive home then the nearest unused car will route itself to you.
"As others have suggested; yes, it is slightly increased, but the car can take the leisurely unclogged back roads back home and not contribute to congestion on main thoroughfares that are quicker even with traffic. It could also go park itself in a cheaper part of the city.

Ideally, it would find someone who wants to travel roughly back in the direction of ""home"" and would take them there, bringing in income for me. "
"Autonomous vehicles will better manage congestion though. 


https://youtu.be/iHzzSao6ypE"
"Well, if you consider that on it's way home and back to get me again it could pick up another passenger rather than having them on the road too, it starts to reduce things. Then you consider that the more Level4/5 cars there are on the road, the more compact and smoothly flowing traffic can be, and suddenly it all makes sense and is reasonable."

"Well, I'm not American, but I do consider Obama to have been science friendly."
Ideally it's going to be covered by a road use tax or car buyer tax likely. Increased car cost would also be a higher incentive to use the autonomous cars that already exist. We could also go the route of more toll roads with the car computer automatically registering upon highway entrance and exit.
Tax electric utilities more

"Originally the snake was introduced as an idea at the D unveiling so that your car can park itself at home.  You don't have to go in the garage with it, it can pull up for you and put itself away.

You mean Elon Fuller Thrust?
"I follow the SpaceX stuff really closely.

It's an interesting analogy.  When they went to F9 Full Thrust it was different enough hardware that their older rockets are no longer compatible with any of their launch hardware.  There is a perfectly fine Falcon dev vehicle sitting around that can't be launched anymore.

The next round of upgrades is all software though, so everything current is compatible with it even the landed boosters.  Sound a bit familiar? "
"They did improve the thrust again, no they didn't call it even fuller thrust.

Falcon 9 has Merlin engines. The new rocket has Raptor engines. 

Essentially ""Full Thrust"" Merlin is as far as that design can go, they had to make a new design to increase the thrust.

Raptor is 3x the thrust of Merlin."
they said all teslas have the hardware.  This way all CPOs can have the self-driving unocked.

See, this is something no one ever talks about. Everyone always talks about how it will be so nice that autonomous cars will obey all the rules, enabling smoother travel. But what if the programmers are idiots who like to hang out in the left lane, and they program the cars to do the same?"
"Off road? I think I've gone off road twice in an ambulance. And it's something I wouldn't want to repeat. Ambulances are very top heavy and prone to tipping. 

It probably depends on where you are as well."
"That sounds like a very interesting job. How'd you get into that if you don't mind me asking? 

Also, I was trying to think of ways around that, and it seems like it'd be very difficult. Being able to tell your car to follow another might work, but would be easily exploited. GPS would be possibly illegal depending on where you are. "
"There were, what? Less than two billion people in the world at the time?

And 80% of the human race worked in agriculture...

And there were plenty of zero-skill labor and manufacturing jobs to fill, so retraining was unnecessary. 

Also: Fodder merchants still had the booming livestock industry. Farriers could apply their craft to any number of other profitable fields. Saddlers could make leather goods, and we even to this day need street cleaners. 

What about a trucker in a world that it is unprofitable to hire a human driver? What do they go on to do?

Their trade skill is operating heavy machinery, and that really only translates to civil engineering _after_ several years of retraining. 

Taxi driver? What possible industry could they apply their skills to? Tour guide? I seriously doubt the worldwide demand for tour guides can support a few hundred thousand extra. 

Agriculture no longer is a 'poverty fallback job', no one hires for manufacturing anymore, the job market is shit unless you go in debt up to your eyebrows for a degree, and even then it's still shit but you stand out above the burger flippers a little at least.

"Please explain to me how an automated car is going to get out and put chains on the tires when it's muddy, get out and hook up the hose to the tank, navigate basically uncharted areas where the roads had been built days before, not to mention all the small things that might break or bend on a truck in the rough terrain that needs fixing. 

It will be nice to be able to hit the highway though and crawl in the sleeper while the truck drives itself to the next location :D"

"Lost ya at the ""if no one is driving there's an oversupply.."" can you clarify? I wanna understand your point"
"Well I think that part is talking more about the Model 3, which should be somewhere in the $40-$43k range with all the autopilot features."
"Yeah, but if you're making a profit on the car what does it really matter?

If the car can pay for itself over 3-5 years and earn you a little bit extra you could realistically afford to have two cars and use the profit from the first (or first 5) to help lower the cost of the second."
"The point isn't to give material to cab companies to make money from, it's meant so everyone can turn into a cabbie while not even being here.

1000 dollars more to activate each one post purchase.   So 10k after purchase or 8k before you get it. 
"Well it costs more than 1.0, I'm just saying it's the same model."
"Yeah, the fact that they could pack in so many sensors AND a supercomputer AND factor in R&D costs... for only $8k? That's insane. Tesla's set a price point for SDC tech now - let's see what other manufacturers do."
"then you are not a potential customer (which is fine, but Tesla doesn't have to serve the entire market) "
"It is, but that's just an example of something digital that you pay for. These teslas so far aren't very high volume so the cost is increased greatly because of that."
"40,000 andes mints at most Mexican restaurants"

I take that back. The website is updated.
"Yep, it's showing up for me now. Didn't think you did, just offering an explanation for the slow page updates."
"Pre-autopilot cars had more traditional brakes and steering. Autopilot 1.0 cars have drive by wire.

That being said, they would still need to add the wiring harnesses for the cameras and add a CPU. They may be able to reuse the ones for radar and sonar."
The wiring harness and mount points is the hardest part. Assuming they're compatible it's not unreasonable to think they could swap the sensors and the computer. 
"He also said that it uses lidar, so he might not have all his facts straight. "
"This is a good, sound theory. I hope you're right. I shouldn't have started drinking before the presidential debate tonight. This is the kind of news I probably would have been happier about yesterday haha. "
Retrofit likely not possible. Or certainly not for 2k.
"Thanks , buddy. I feel you're pain. "
You think they are expecting people to pay $8K for sunbathing that may have almost no benefit for three years? I mean I'm skeptical too that this is that ready at this point but very surprised to see that price with no benefit. 
"True, but he took delivery (I would assume a new vehicle) last week."
Do you have a source for this?
"the miles aren't for validating, they are for training"
"I think that's giving them the benefit of the doubt. I do admit they must be some way into the foray to know what hardware they ""need"" for full/better autonomy, but I don't really see any reason to give them that benefit unless they're announcing a date or even an approximate date when those items become available."
"But they were using another company's code. Now they're using their own. Who knows how far along that is, if at all. They may've had legal disputes with MobilEye (knowing their recent controversies) that prevent them from shipping new vehicles with their software after a certain date and forcing their hand."
"The alternative would be to have a larger fleet of test cars before shipping the hardware to customers.

Tesla chose the more streamlined option of putting the hardware into mass production earlier, but that has trade-offs."
Very good point.  I do feel bad for folks who dropped $140k and won't ever have the maximal level of possible autonomy.
"They are disabling existing features that the previous Autopilot suite included.

They need to validate behavior and sensor data from the new system (which no longer uses MobileEye vision processing) before re-enabling those features."
"The real issue is for someone who ordered a Tesla 2 weeks ago that included adaptive cruise control, and will soon take delivery of a car with that feature disabled.

I suppose they can refuse delivery and forfeit their deposit (since you usually haven't really purchased the car until delivery), but it's still not a great situation."
"That's valid for people ordering today with that information. What about those who ordered a couple of weeks ago who selected the previous autopilot functionality in their order but will now receive something different?

I like what Tesla is going for here, just playing devil's advocate."
But then you pay a $2000 penalty...
"It seems the number of cameras is different, 4 vs 8, so upgrade may not be possible"
"People don't ""bitch"" because of promises of revolutionary change.  People SUE because they don't receive what was promised.  We all want the same thing, it is simply unfortunate that it has to happen this way.
  
Also, I think you're making my point about the standard safety features being disabled.  The automatic braking, for instance, is being disabled.  The good news is that they anticipate reenabling it in December, so hopefully there are no incidents until then.  I really want this to go smoothly for Tesla."
"In the design center it says the enhanced autopilot features will be enabled December 2016 so only a couple of months delay, plus new orders are expected to deliver in December anyway, so there is no delay for those, very small amount of people who ordered in the past few weeks will be without features for a couple of months."
"I mean both actually. The people who recently purchased were happy to pay the price they did for the tech they got, so whether the new tech is $5k more or the same price shouldn't matter. And for people purchasing after today, they're hurt by the fact that the highest end AP is now $5k more. So I'm not sure *who* the higher price ""helps,"" as your post says."
"Elon has already said the cost delta of upgrading AP from 1.0 to 2.0 exceeds the cost of buying a new car.  Why dump that much labor and cash into upgrading when swapping for a new car is cheaper? What do you expect tesla to do instead?  Something like, ""hey early adopters, as thanks for your patronage, you can get your car updated for $8k"". No, that would bankrupt the company and disrupt growth substantially since they'd be subsidising a significant cost just to make your early-adopter burn feel better.
 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/789007996038721536

Also, by offering the hardware before the software is ready, they're essentially making current buyers' cars more obsolete-proof.  Much better than not putting any of the hardware out there for the next year.  Now many more new customers will have an easy upgrade path through the air when it's ready."
It's definitely a new product.
Good point on the future proofing.  Let's hope it's true. 
"True, but even as the tesla webpage says, the regulations are expected to vary from state to state.  This is a very new area of technology and the government of course is way behind the technology companies."
"That is assuming Uber doesn't evolve to be in a competing market with Tesla network. I would guess that by the time fully automated driving is street legal, tesla, Uber and others will all have a dog in the race... in which case I'm guessing you won't be needed in the Uber car, and tesla won't be fine with it. "

I love the idea of having my car drop me off at work and then go drive around.
"I know the issues your speaking about. Its slightly different, there isnt any anticompetitive threads within john deeres reasoning. "
"I agree the market wont turn against them easily but regulators in many states already are lol

Edit: the incompatible products you mention are slightly different as well. If there was a 3rd party ink cartridge that fit your printer and the printer company said you can only use ours or else, no one would listen. There is no physical limitation with the tesla preventing it from being used with other services. At least that we know of at this time"
"That's very true, but it seems pretty clear cut.

Even if it's only that you can't ""self-drive"" the car in a ride sharing app, that still is something that rubs me the wrong way. As long as my usage of something doesnt hurt them, they shouldn't be able to restrict it. Even if that means I'm using it in a way they don't ""like""."
"But we already have laws and systems in place to manage that.

Just because I buy a car from Toyota doesn't mean Toyota can force me to never deliver pizza in it. But it sounds to me like Tesla might be trying to enforce a similar limitation, and to me that's not okay."
"Once I made the reservation, I told my wife that, no matter the cost I am purchasing the autopilot upgrade.. she was like ""um, ok, I guess"".

She saw the news a bit ago and asked ""we are still getting the autopilot model right?""

Very true. 
"No, it's going to take time for your attitude and then the laws to catch up.

The hardware is already here.

The SOFTWARE is already here.

The only thing not here is you."
"By what metric?  It all depends what you consider ahead.  Mercedes prototypes are arguably the best out there, and they're just modified production cars. "
Finally some sense in here. The regulatory stuff is also key
"Even beyond the technical, it looks like they're planning to sell a fully autonomous option immediately? That seems... risky. It's approved in zero jurisdictions and beurocracy is slow. How long will it be before those who pay for the option now can actually use it?"
"what? that says 4 cameras but fredtesla says 8!

~~edit:  oh.  because filthy lies and photoshop!~~
edit: ah, I see"
I don't expect full autonomy for five years. My guess is incremental improvements over time. Full autonomy including city driving has a ton of variables.

Tesla didn't even have Autopilot until 2014.
"risky from the litigation point of view. i love tesla and i am amazed at how certain media organizations have clearly taken a liking to koch money. not having a safety tech is one thing, removing it is another matter. worries me that someone accidentally or intentionally will suffer with the removal of tech"
"Most $50k and under cars don't have them. Many of the basic features discussed (apart from AP 1.0) are relatively standard for higher end luxury vehicles. Which is definitely what the tesla s and x are.

Wouldn't be surprised if BMW tries taking advantage of the situation. ""Why buy an EV that'll give you basic safety features 'sometime in the future' when you can buy a BMW EV with all those features available now."" Sure it negates the advancements of AP 2.0 in the tesla, but the average EV consumer isn't going to care about the promise of AP 2.0 in the grand scheme of things when considering buying a car today."
:D

"A real possibility is that there is some liability insurance included with self-driving. They can tell you that you aren't covered with their insurance if you use the car for commercial purposes. 

Self-driving is also a software feature, and software can be easily limited in use. Are you saying that it's not legal for software companies to sell a student a software package for $100 for non-commercial use, but sell it to a corporation for $25,000?

"Here in Germany outside of cities the limit is 62mph (100 km/h) and people drive about 5 to 15% over the limit. Most conjunctions have a 43 mph limit, but not all. Here the Forward Looking Side Cameras with 80m are mostly in affect.
I don't think those 80m are a hard limit, this would be very very bad! But what is the actual limit? The numbers provided on https://www.tesla.com/autopilot are great for city and rural areas, but on fast highways especially here on the Autobahn they seem worrisome.
To give you a view numbers on the Autobahn; Trucks have a speed limit of 50 mph, there is a suggested cruising speed of 80 mph, but there could be some one on the left line with 150 mph. When I'm behind the truck and I want to switch the line we are talking about a delta v of 100 mph here, or 44,7 m/s, or 2.3 seconds from entering the 100m radius of the Rearward Looking Side Cameras and passing you.
Honestly 150 mph is not that common, most business sedans travel at around 90 to 110 mph. But belief me, there are people trying out there Porsche, or Audi, or whatever at 200 mph (Probably not Audi ^^), even I had once the chance (thou I wasn't the driver).

A autopilot must be able to handle all real world situations, even if some of them are extreme."

"Good points. I think I misunderstood this section of The Verge [article](http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/19/13340938/tesla-autopilot-update-model-3-elon-musk-update):

> Musk says that the “Tesla Neural Net” doesn’t require any third party hardware sensors, and that it’s based on the Nvidia Titan GPU (although it could run on other processors). He says that it’s 40 times more powerful than the last Tesla computer, “it’s basically a supercomputer in a car,” he said.

Reading it again it sounds like they have a custom solution based on regular Nvidia GPUs, not the specialized Nvidia chips for driving which are probably much more expensive."
Thanks. I guess it went over my head.
"The option on the order page is for the convenience features of autopilot. The safety features use the same hardware, and come standard."
That would be awesome. I hope they clarify this before mine goes into production.

"> firmware can be updated, no?

Strictly speaking, sure.  But there is also a limit to the interface it has to the hardware behind it.  If what it turns out you really need is a faster imaging processing chip next to the camera, you'll be out of luck.  If what you need is a faster communication bus that talks from the camera out to the rest of the software, you're out of luck.  Fast image recognition is going to be done primarily in parts of the camera/hardware that aren't easily changeable.  

After all, dashcams are cheap and plentiful and have been around for ages.  What Tesla is installing isn't just a dashcam, it has serious additional hardware attached to understand the image quickly.  I would guess that the camera needs to take another picture and break it down into cars/people/lines/walls roughly 50-100 times a second (human eye is around 20 times/second).  That means you have 10ms or less per image, which simply can't be done in software alone."
RELEASE THE TITAN
"presumably if they're selling a feature they want customers to use it

the problem is it's not legal to do so anywhere afaik at this point in time, so while I see the value to Tesla I don't really see the value for consumers like I originally said, it's like they're selling a BluRay player in 1995, something that has a very high cost and very questionable utility at the time

"That's a lot of units that need to be produced, tested, deployed and possibly have the superchargers retrofitted to accept this sort of attachment given the layout of current supercharging stations.  All while they are trying to roll out more and more superchargers.  That doesn't even take into account if they can be broken or damaged at the locations.

Autopilot (sans last night's announcement) has basically been software updates pushed out over the air.  Not retrofits of current hardware all across the world.  This is an apples and oranges comparison.

I can see them start to roll them out and that's great! I can see them putting them on a specific route for the car to actually go cross country too as a publicity grabber, that's a great plan.  But widespread roll outs of this tech will cost a lot and there's a lot of barriers in the way that will need to be worked out in the meantime.

I'm not saying it won't happen... I'm just very sceptical that it'll be rolled out that soon to anything other than one route across the US for a publicity stunt.  Why is that a bad stance to take?"

This may be the best self-driving prototype so far, but also it is filmed at the Tesla HQ, the place Tesla cars know the best. We also don't have a clue how many times they tried filming to 'nail it'. Maybe 1, maybe 10. Remember the 2 days delay, and then another delay to post the video?  
Someone commented it didn't stop at 2 stop signs. I didn't check that, so I don't know if that is true.  
But I did check if there were available disabled parking spots at the end of the video, and those were all occupied. Elon tweeted that the car read signs and that's why it didn't park in one of those. But all were already occupied in the video, so it doesn't make much sense. Maybe that was an other video they also filmed?"

"The only real change at this point would be replacing the 360 degree sensors with solid state lidar.  But tesla right now is clearly saying it can all be done with 360 cameras and ultra sonic sensors and a single forward facing lidar.

If they make it possible to replace the cameras/ultrasonic sensors just for maintence/repair purposes, in theory if they switch to 360 degree lidar instead of cameras/sensors, you can swap the existing cameras/sensors for lidar.

If that was a 5 grand job, it would be worth it on a 90k car."

"There's no direct evidence of any ""neural net"" making decisions. Are you implying that AP cannot make decisions if it doesn't have access to the internet? That isn't how AP works.

Furthermore, the guys who programmed the AI neural net would know exactly how it works. "
"Yes, but it doesn't work the other way. If a driver slowed down and the system didn't detect something they can't know if you stopped for something or just slowed down for some other reason. Did you stop for a pedestrian or did you just slow down to look for a certain shop at the side of the road? There is no way for the car to tell if it didn't detect a pedestrian."

"I think there will be a mix of ownership and sharing.

But I predict autonomy will further accelerate the take up of electric cars. The main complaint, that it needs time to charge will be fixed when cars could drive itself, charge and use an algorithm to plan the most effective way to do all that...."
Yeah I expect that the next generation won't even have car ownership as a goal.
"Correct.  Expect old-tech auto manufacturers to draft and support (by paying politicians) legislation against significant, meaningful autonomous driving. Insurance companies will get on board due to the threat of a 'race to the bottom' on premiums with competitors old and new (Tesla-brand auto insurance - our actuarial tables are based on real-time data!).  Studies will be funded, the cry of 'Job killer' will be raised, and the next fatality will be spun as evidence of the immorality of computers deciding who lives and who dies.  Oh, and eventually the oil companies will see the writing on the wall and they are accomplished at mass deception/manipulation, as well as being well-connected and well-funded.  This seems like a slam-dunk, but it is far from a level playing field.

The bright spot is that Elon is a smart, experienced businessman and knows this and more. Perhaps he will freely offer Tesla's data, co-opting some auto manufacturers and insurance companies to his side before the battle is joined in earnest."
"Autonomous driving will win. It's likely going to be situation in the next decade where companies that don't offer autonomous driving, and maybe even electric vehicles will be doomed to go bankrupt. The automotive industry is changing at an accelerated pace lately, and in the end we all win."
"Well, Tesla is not going to license their tech. I haven't seen a GM self driving car yet, much less like the one done by Tesla now. As far as I know, Ford is pretty further along than GM. Many other car companies are pretty behind compared to Tesla. Only google and Uber comparable."
"That assumes that the computing hardware is actually enough, which we just don't really know for sure yet. "
"That's part of why Tesla isn't going the lidar route.  Cameras, plus some radar/ultrasonic work pretty well.  After all, humans just have two cameras, and we manage just fine."
"There are certain Radar technologies that are very much capable of seeing through bad weather, and even small objects, (X-ray, anyone?) and no it does not defy the laws of physics.

"> Drive me home, I'm drunk. 3 years in legality.

I think that's really optimistic.

Not only does the driving have to be 100% perfect by that point (parallel parking ingress and egress;  roundabouts;  no interference from any kind of weather ever; etc) the regulatory framework will take a long time to catch up.

There are a lot of people that make a lot of money off of drunk driving:  insurance, courts, cops, body shops.  They're not going to let go of that piece of the pie that easily."

"Actually, according to the product page, you wouldn't even need to say anything.  If it detects nothing to be on your calendar, it'll drive you home automatically.  Somewhere they said that they will be targeting a coast-to-coast drive with no human intervention by end of next year."
"It isn't. Normal roads, messy intersections and a pedestrian. Given, it doesn't cover the extreme corner cases (snow, construction, etc). "
"No because the car drives back and forth instead of staying parked at the destination. Of course if they had 2 cars before the autonomous car it's a different story.

If we live in a world where there are roads full of autonomous vehicles there won't have to be any unusual maneuvers because the vehicles will be able to connect with each other and prioritize if necessary.

But on the rest, I actually agree with you. I see serious issues with the position of those hailing the bright new world. On the pure scale of human economics I just can't see how the total automation of life can actually work. 

The sheer number of people globally who will be locked out isn't accounted for. In some cases, development steps will be missed. Already there are people using smart phones who have never had access to a landline. People will have access to electric cars when no one in their  family will ever have owned an ICE.

Uber/Lyft/Taxis are expensive because you have to pay the driver. The wear and tear on the car is minimal. If you take the driver out of the equation you could realistically charge someone $10-$15 for anywhere in the city.. do that 5 times a day and you've just made $1500+ a month on a fare that cost the user a fraction of the cost of a car with a driver.

Smartphone cameras are really cheap and pretty good, same with microphones and speakers (for ultrasonic sensors), I don't know about radar but let's assume the hardware is pretty straight-forward so they can buy or make that on the cheap as well. I imagine the ""supercomputer"" is made of a few nvidia chips, it can't be anything too insane so maybe $1k for the chips, a bit extra to integrate all the hardware into the car, so the biggest cost by far is the software."

"This.  Neural networks (NNs) are experience based systems.  They have to release the new sensor suite into the wild to gather experience (collect sensor data).  Once they collect the new data over n miles, they will train, test, and validate the optimized autopilot NN.  Then the NNs will be pushed to all Tesla's in the fleet.

The fastest way to do this is have their customers collect all the data.  In the future, if they ever significantly update the sensor suite again, they will have to repeat this entire process.  NNs only work for the sensor suite they were developed on.  Mobileye provided the old [forward facing cameras, processor, NN].  This this is getting replaced, hence new NNs are being created."

"I mean, I was mainly joking. I'm not sure why you're making this into some kind of Congressional hearing."
"Ok, my last reply was admittedly kind of a copout. I am feeling too frustrated about this situation to want to explain it, but here goes anyway- maybe this will be therapeutic for me. Probably not.

Case 1: Recent buyers. Firstly, the ""you got what you paid for"" rhetoric is really tiresome. You won't hear anyone who bought a Tesla in the last 2 months say that. This is not something that happens with other cars, you know when a new model year is coming out and adjust expectations accordingly. You'd often be getting a big discount buying a 2016 model at the end of 2016.

If you were to ask any recent buyer (who cares about AP) if they would have waited another month or two, knowing what we know now, and paid an extra $5500 for latest hardware, I think the answer would almost always be yes.

Even if it's true that we should be happy to have paid what we paid and got what was advertised, that doesn't account for the insane instant depreciation. My car is worth considerably less now than it was two days ago. That's very hard to reconcile when this was one of the biggest (and, admittedly, stupidest) financial decisions of my life. For most of us, buying a Tesla is a once-in-a-lifetime thing and having missed the boat on the future of the technology by a matter of weeks is frustrating, but so is the thought that tens of thousands of dollars just flew out the window, in terms of the value of the asset purchased.

So, to that end, knowing that a newly-purchased car with a similar configuration would be more expensive is at least some consolation, in that it slightly offsets the harshness of the depreciation.

Case 2: New buyers. This one I still don't quite understand what you're getting at. The new hardware is a huge improvement, and there's a lot more tech going in the car. 

If a new buyer is going to complain about having to pay more for this hardware, then I'm sure there are plenty of owners of recently-purchased models who would be more than happy to sell their barely-used vehicle at a nice discount. I know I would. Anyone looking to buy a MX who is mad about having to pay more money for the future of autonomous driving, give me a PM, I've got a great deal for you on a 1-month old car."
">by offering the hardware before the software is ready, they're essentially making current buyers' cars more obsolete-proof.

Yep, that's what I was thinking when I decided to buy a brand new model of Tesla too - that the AP features would improve over time through software. I doubt you will see much more improvement in AP1.0 from here on out. I often hear the argument ""well, you got what you paid for at the time"", but the reality is that AP1.0 doesn't work well enough to be practical and even when you drive completely manually, [the car can interfere with your driving in some very unsafe ways that I have personally experienced.](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/obstacle-detected-blocking-acceleration-very-dangerous.72878/) I suspect that they have determined that these are problems that cannot simply be solved by software and a move to a more comprehensive sensor suite was prudent, even for level-2 automation."
"My goodwill would go to Tesla's service. I have been a passenger and driver for Uber and do not agree with their business practices or how they split the commission one bit. I'm doing the legwork in that relationship.

Maybe an easier pill to swallow when, even though it is my car, the car itself is doing the work, if there is some kind of commission split at all. Everything is just pissing in the wind at this point"
"Maaaan, rides are going to end up being so cheap. This is great. "
"I think they don't care what you are doing with your car **as long as you are in the drivers seat**, because as long as there needs to be a driver involved the price can't be competitive with teslas autonomus service. They just don't want you to let your car be a **self-driving ueber** while you are at your normal job"
"It's specifically to prevent owners from repairing their own tractors. Tesla's reason is far less nefarious (they're putting the majority of the effort into self driving, so they should reap the reward, not Uber or Lyft)."
"These are interesting times - a lot of things are being dealt with that we've just never had to decide before.  

And you're right, the ink example is not a perfect one in implementation (there is a check that they can do to enforce compliance....) I'm not sure how that will work with a Tesla or how they could / would enforce it. My point was more that HP put an artificial limitation on their product, let you know about it as part of the product info, and they don't face any regulatory impacts.  

I do assume, though, that if Tesla can get a car to drive itself then they can bloody well figure out how to make the car *not* drive itself for Uber. "
"You don't even know if anything's restricted even. Maybe they just want you to register the car with them for liability purposes or some such. Hell, it could be for your own benefit. "
More of an EV than a hybrid which is why I bought it. Even with the gas generator running it drives more like an electric because the electric motor is pretty much always driving the wheels. Also it never touches gas if it has a charge even if you stomp on the gas unlike most other plug in hybrids.

So, I guess they are just selling a fully autonomous capable car for now."
"It does specifically clarify that it's pending regulatory approval. 

I wonder if they will offer refunds for those who buy this now if there end up being extra long regulatory delays? "
"4 cameras are enabled with the one package, the other 4 are enabled with the full autonomy package.

You can see the text for yourself on the tesla site now."
https://www.tesla.com/autopilot?redirect=no
"Oh, totally agree. I guess I should hedge ""full autonomy"" meaning in certain types of driving. Right now they can do partial autonomy/assist in highway driving. I would expect (depending on legal framework) they could achieve full highway autonomy within the next 12-18 months. City driving is pretty nuts."
"Thanks for the explanation, interesting stuff.

From what was mentioned in their earlier communications (if I remember correctly) Tesla said for each unique situation they're logging what the driver chose in comparison to what the car chose given the same data. Do you not think that system is robust enough in itself with your understanding of what computer vision is capable of today? "
"Well it seems like OP is talking about safety features, which other manufacturers have had in various forms for a lot longer than 2014. Mostly confined to the luxury market, but in 2012-2014 you started to see them in mass market vehicles."
If you can answer: When is it planning to hit market?
"I would love to see it tested in court, yes. :-)  You cant tell me that I cant make my own business doing it and I shouldnt be forced to include you in profits from my business."
"While you make interesting points. In what way is this different to what a human can see. If anything its better. How quickly would you see a porche zooming down at 200mph? And as you said the most common fast people are around 100mph. So that's 30mph relative speed to you. When you join from a junction its not onto the fast lane. Autopilot will need to be clever on the autobahn and it will be interesting challenge for the engineers.

Also, 2.3 seconds is quite a lot of time for a computer. Can't do many calcs at the moment because on my phone.  "
"Tesla is using a Titan GPU, not the drive platform as far as we know. Tesla vision is an end to end software platform developed by Tesla
https://electrek.co/2016/10/20/tesla-new-autopilot-hardware-suite-camera-nvidia-tesla-vision/"
Elon just tweeted that he is going to post a video of the self driving in action.. not sure when.
Thanks! What's what I was asking !
"Yup, also the Nvidia PX-2 is 120 times more powerful than a Macbook Pro so there is no way Tesla's new autopilot computer is 40 times more power than the previous one. "
"Yes. You're right. However, Tesla has separated autopilot and self-driving. Full self-driving will be available as a hardware upgrade on new Teslas only, either at the time purchase or as a hardware upgrade. 

I can see a class action over that, because Tesla was clearly marketing self-driving and autopilot as one and the same. I'm sure people who just bought a new Tesla with autopilot are pissed they are excluded from ""full self-driving capability."""
"If it has not entered production yet, then you'll get the full setup free of charge. 

If you purchased the ""old"" AutoPilot, then they may provide you with the Enhanced one free of charge, as they did with other newly introduced options in the past for vehicles ordered before major announcements."
"Aha, I missed that word. :)"
And yet people seem happy to pay extra for a car that can do 155mph.
"No, they said every car in production has the hardware necessary for full autonomy."
"Good info.  Always a pleasure hearing from someone who knows their shit. Thank you, sir"
"Florida, California, and Nevada all have laws that allow for autonomous driving in some form with a set of bills in Michigan that just passed through the Senate. So wide spread regulatory approval isn't that far away. On top of that, using the full self drive function as a driver aid is fully legal.  "
Those who want it will have special places for them. Think about it this way - you can't ride a horse on the highway.
"Likely better than you or I can.  We move on limitee input, muscle memory,  minimal training and instinct.  It moves based on a huge sensor suite,  physics calculations,  constantly updated software and millions of hours of driver data. 

Even if we do better now,  it will always be improving until it overtakes us. "
"Yeah, a little road salt fucks these sensors. "
I so wish I had seen this thread earlier. Missed my chance to participate... and totally would have. 
"And then insurance companies will rise their prices to extremes for non autonomous vehicles, pushing the autonomous revolution even faster. "
Hopefully soon enough. 
That just isn't true. Uber is doing automated cars in SF and there's no driver
"I never said it was a bad stance to take. I'm just pointing out that technology can change drastically in a year, and the last update we had was a year ago. 

However I agree hardware rollouts do seem prohibitively difficult given the  investment into the current charging system. Elon musk recently tweeted the video of the snake charger and hinted that it would be used though. "
"I think you're jumping a little too far ahead. Destination and home chargers aren't really feasible to modify to work from under the car, the current charge port is fine. 

Besides, if you're having the car line up with precision to some physical charge port, why does it need to be under the car? Why not just have it be on the side of the car and use the current charge port. "
"That is actually a great example.  Car companies don't update those systems, so carplay and android auto have completely died off.  Users are too restricted by those limited interfaces and instead can just mount their own phone in a holder on the dash and use it directly.  Apple and car companies wanted planned obsolescence and no one is buying.  Android auto didn't even make it into the marketplace at all.

Neither apple nor google are willing to just make a dumb terminal in a car that just passes tap input to the phone and display back to the terminal like a remote desktop window.  Something that would never go obsolete since it just transmits the video and taps, the phone itself can display anything it wants."
Right but some data is still better than no data
"I understand what you are trying to say. But the relevance is in the car payment, Cars aren't **usually** priced differently by demographics, since demand plays a huge part in cost. So even if I lived in California and made the adjusted salary I currently have I couldn't justify that car payment. I can afford it but could never justify it. That's what I trying to say. Sorry for the confusion. "
"Ask /u/IHeartMyKitten, not me. Although I do recall him saying something like that."
"Sure, sure.
So, the kid caught a wave.
Right now, he and his dingus are on top.
Well, this too shall pass."
He has a lot of bold claims. He also has an issue delivering on those bold claims...
lol ok
"Bah, that would be like King Canute holding back the tide. A company, you can sabotage, but a technology? Good luck I say. It is like horse merchants sabotaging the Ford. "
"Nice thing about the GPU, it can be upgraded easily (Musk confirmed as much on Twitter tonight)."
"And, as better sensors end up available for cheaper, they'll most likely upgrade."
Two cameras with the best computer known and nothing else comes close.
"That insight on radar's limitations is actually incorrect. Radar can very much see through a lot of bad weather, including fog, and is actually how aircraft currently handle landings during inclement weather."

"> especially backed by the ICE and fossil fuel interests

I don't see why. Autonomy isn't an ICE vs EV issue-- autonomous gas cars could just as easily exist. "
"I can see it being rolled out in locations that have their traffic code written as not to outright ban it but not explicitly allow it either. Essentially, the new tech gray ""depends on how the cop feels that day"" area."
I didn't get what are the new capabilities that will be introduced in December though. Did I miss these?
Safety will ultimately be more important and override that. Cops can take care of real crimes if you eliminate drunk driving and the problems that stem from it. It wouldn't be hard to convince police that lost an officer from drunk or distracted driving that it's better to be safe and prevent needless deaths.
Less than 5 years imo. 
"You are kidding yourself if you think it'll take only three years for full autonomy to become legal in all U.S. states. I imagine most states will increasingly approve some autopilot, waiting to see if the tech works and approving more features if it does.  Full autonomous driving for anyone on an uncontrolled experiment is something that has never been done before. It'll take a lot of time to regulate it. "
"Yeah, I saw it too. I was quite surprised by this actually. It tells you a lot about the current state of the software."
I know. I saw it's a 36 month lease for teslas. After his lease ends he'll be able to get a new tesla with the autopilot suite.
Oh nvm sorry. Didn't notice it was for 36 months. He still probably wouldn't miss out on full autonomous driving for more than a few months. Even if the software will be ready today it'll take years for regulation to catch up.
"The term is fail active,  or fail passive.  And fail active is only in the last 200 feet if there is a failure in a list of conditions, then it will continue to land.  But that is for an entire 15 seconds. 

Your confidence in the technology is admirable,  but most people are fairly glad there are pilots at the front.  Trust me,  things go wrong more often than you think. "
"The autopilot we have in most of our jets...does not autoland.

My deal?  My deal is reality, which I live and work in, on this system you are talking about."
"You mean, like an autonomous Tesla vehicle will be his boss?!"
"I'd say, in a given week, I do maybe 3 hours of *actual* work. The rest is stand-by and Reddit. I love my job."
"And pooping at work, not at home.  "
Who has the money that is gone to student loans?
"Yeah man. All jobs are going to be automated, but reddit has a solution - everyone can just start their own company.

Robots are going to make capitalism and wage slavery a lot worse, and at the same time make them completely obsolete.."
That was great! Is there anything else like that? 
Awesome! 
You mean make laws that force employers to pay workers for sitting at home? Absolutely never going to happen. You'd have more chance redistributing wealth through taxes and benefits - but even that is a pretty tough challenge in 2016 America.

"Here in Germany, they sometimes run red lights if it's a really dire situation. I'd call that a non standard maneuver.

Do the ambulances in the US run red lights? Never seen one when I was there."
You just described the [Rendezvous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services_in_Germany#Rendezvous_system)
Maybe the let you place the desired parking position on a map on the center console.
"Elon said that people are going to be able to have their car act as an uber, making them money while they aren't driving it, so I imagine a decent amount of parking just won't happen.

For the remainder there could be algorithmic spot selection, optimizing for shortest walk to the destination or for shade or whatever people care about."
"You are correct, but I think an autonomous car would do better at that, although it'd need a lot more specialized programing I would guess."
"We do a LOT of non-emergency driving. It'd be worth the automation if we do a [Rendezvous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services_in_Germany#Rendezvous_system), except in America we'd have one basic in a transport ambulance and a paramedic in a fly car (suburban basically)

That is what I see as an ideal situation in an autonomous world."
"I would drive up to a building, yes. In an emergency I park wherever is closest. I'd say a good 99% of buildings have roads within feet of their entrance though. I'm struggling to think of anywhere where I'd have to go off road to go anywhere.

Additionally, property owners don't much like us driving on grass and stuff."
"I am beginning to feel that there will be 3 major possible outcomes (and I am of course assuming that global warming doesn't kill us all in the next 5 decades). 

1) Mass exodus to lesser developed countries where infrastructure has not yet been completely automated. A lot of newer 'high tech' cottage industries will appear with corner stall workshops cranking out short order 3d printing and other highly technical skills that 1st world (in the casual sense) citizens may have the knowledge of through better education. Basically the middle and poverty classes will no longer afford to live in the capitalist utopia that the ultra-wealthy are so successfully creating.

2) Massive riots after people's children miss their third meal. Nothing motivates bloody revolution more than the unnecessary suffering of the innocent. 

3) We move onto Capitalism 2.0 which is an attention based economy, not a labor-for-pay-based one. In fact we're already forming the basis of this now through popular youtube and twitter personalities. 

That's basically what advertisement is, they are buying consumers' attention. The thing we need to do is decouple the requirement of pay for purchase from the whole loop. I know this sounds ridiculous from a Capitalism 1.0 mindset, though it really isn't once you examine the entire loop. 

Banks generate money out of thin air based on the confidence of the value of America's productivity. This money is used to grant loans to businesses, which assumedly use these loans to improve the productivity of their business beyond the interest cost of the loan. 

Businesses use part of this to pay their workers, to incentivize them to come work, because most people, even those who love their jobs, are unlikely to do them out of the kindness of their own heart. Which is where prestige comes in. Being a worker in a prestigious company is prestigious in itself (as any Tesla engineer will agree with), and serves as the motivator for contribution. 

The thing is in Capitalism 1.0, as automation becomes more affordable and general-purpose, the whole part that gets paid to humans disappears into another corporate channel. The average person's attention becomes valueless as they cannot actually buy the products for the advertisements they see (which is wasted advertising money).

The reason why advertising is useful is because it convinces humans to give up some of that money to buy the products the advertisement promotes. 

But this doesn't work if humans aren't getting money anymore. 

The thing is: **this entire process is just a lucky happenstance abstraction of something far more fundamental**: the effective distribution of resources. 

And capitalism is technically or accidentally just a system of prioritizing the distribution of resources. 

In Capitalism 1.0, if 'Somethingum' is an important mineral in the making of several different widgets, and the supply is limited, then the 'winner' of the limited resource is the one who can pay the most for it.

Presumably this means that they are a successful company (as they have money) and will efficiently use this resource to produce goods and services that exceed the 'value' of the resource in an unchanged, in-situ state. 

So Capitalism 1.0 is actually a self-optimizing resource distribution chain with focus nodes being companies that buy, transform, and sell resources, where unsuccessful companies do not have the same access to raw materials as successful ones, so fall out of the market and get out of the way.

The thing is, that loop isn't working right now for a number of reasons and this post is already too long so I won't go into them. 

So we need an alternative method of distribution of resources, if we desire the optimal disposition of limited materials. 

Which is where attention comes in. 

How do we know which is the best smartphone right now? By who sells more. and the company that captures the majority of market attention becomes more profitable and prestigious, thereby allowing them to hire the second-best engineers (because we all know where the best go, we're in the sub!), expand manufacturing facilities, and successfully secure raw materials.

If instead the public attention were captured by an ubiquitous monitoring system (which is abhorrent to me, but is where we are unavoidably heading so at least let's use it for the public good as well), and value associated by the buzz and hype that would-be buyers are experiencing gets algorithmically changed into 'resource distribution points' that the company can then exchange for construction and expansion, and the prestige will attract skilled engineers who wish to be part of a prestigious product and company. 

The construction companies treat these 'resource points' just like the manufacturers, increasing their prestige and giving them access to manufactured machinery, and will attract civil engineers that wish to be a part of such a prestigious construction company. 

It's basically a slightly altered loop from Capitalism 1.0, turning attention into the currency of expansion. Companies that garner attention are considered good-risks to invest the productivity of America by the banks for the purpose of securing loans, as their products will likely increase America's prestige and authority. Sure, the definition of 'bank' will need to be changed from 'A place where money is stored' to 'A place where market attention is carefully monitored', the process is still the same, companies likely to increase the productivity of the nation as a whole are rewarded with resources to grow their businesses. 

Look I know there are still issues with this system, overpopulation and resource depletion for one, so there will have to be societal changes as well as corporate. 

I feel this will be a much better shape for humanity in the long run because it will allow people with competence and public awareness to compete in the 'market of ideas' with other more established entities without the roadblock of starting capital. 

The 'starting capital' will exactly be how much of the population they can get excited about their product. 

I know this won't necessarily guarantee better products or smoother operations, even the best idea can fail. That isn't a big deal because Capitalism 1.0 doesn't guarantee that either. 

What it _will_ do, on the other hand, is reduce the penalties for failing while leveling the playing field and opening up new business paradigms. 

This will lead to a more diverse on-the-whole ecosystem of products and services (so no one provider disappearing will collapse the system. What would the world be like right now if Microsoft went under?). 

There's more, but we've already got a Great Text of China going on, and we've all got work to do today.  "
"I understand the point better now, thanks.  I guess I'm of the belief that the number of available Teslas relative to the amount of available Uber cars is so small that it wouldn't move the needle much, not enough to overcome the massive head start Uber has with being synonymous with ridesharing.  Maybe when there's millions of Teslas on the road, then yes,.
"
Now you are talking about hacking a car.  Which if you are going to make it completely driverless... You do not even remotely want. 
"Maybe you can hack the features on the car, but hack to the access to the fleet learning information from the Tesla servers is going to be more difficult. "
and never get any updates of maps or the autopilot software? There are far easier ways to kill yourself. 
"True, I think Elon Musk wants the Autonomy program to pay for itself by the ways of people buying this software now. Hardware is included in Model S/X price already, you get it even without ordering software. Those $5-10k are all purely for autonomy research if you ask me."
"Right, thanks for bringing that up! It's certainly theoretically possible, as he has shown. 

But the price delta between one of the pre and post autopilot cars were below the cost of adding the hardware, so it kind of isn't economically worth it."
I should think so! ;)
"Production starting now with the new non-MobileEye hardware.

Really the only issue is for those who may have ordered recently and will get a car that's temporarily worse than what they thought they were getting when they put the deposit down.

I could see Tesla refunding order deposits if someone was truly upset about this, but I think most people will be fine.

"
But Tesla has never met a schedule. It won't be broadly available until 2017
I didn't realize that; tone is hard to gather via text. But I responded because it kind of rubs me wrong to think that having to spend an extra $5k now makes anyone (besides Tesla) better off.
"I think I understand what you're saying. You feel cheated because you had no way of knowing this was right around the corner, whereas most other companies announce major releases well before they actually start rolling out. I can appreciate that.

It just seems odd to me to go ""well this sucks, but it makes me feel better that those other bastards who waited have to part with an additional $5k to upgrade! Serves 'em right!"" Which probably isn't what you were going for, but is just how I interpreted your initial comment.

You do bring up a good point about depreciation, but honestly, I would expect a considerable amount of that with any brand new car. Take solace in the fact that you car won't depreciate by nearly as much as an equivalently-priced German car. I also don't think it's as bad as you seem to think-- even the cheapest non-AP CPO cars are still $45k+, so I don't think this has cost you ""tens of thousands of dollars."""
"I've heard a lot of Uber drivers express that sentiment... that is unfortunate. It seems like a company with such a forward thinking service is really missing an opportunity to also deliver a better experience for the drivers, too, since they're the ones doing the work. "
[deleted]
Then they shouldn't be selling the car with that capability to the general public. If i own a taxi fleet why shouldnt i be able to buy the car and use it to replace my drivers? 
"I'm not vowing to never buy the car here, I'm discussing a policy that they *might* put in place.

It might change, it might get better, it might get worse, nobody knows.

But right now that paragraph has some pretty bad connotations and I'm voicing my concern for it. If they go through with it how it sounds, I'll probably make a bigger stink, but for now I at least want my voice heard that it doesn't sound good.

I'm not trying to hurt the stock or anything, I really hope I'm wrong about this (hell I've got a good chunk of stock myself), but this is something that I really don't like on a bunch of levels."
How much kms can you go on a full charge and also using the generator? Can it do 200 kms in a day?
"I think the disconnect is the difference between SAE and NHTSA.  NHTSA had a four level system that they abandoned once the US DOT adopted the SAE 6 level (0-5) system.

The TechRepublic article references NHTSA.  In the reference it says:
> fully autonomous vehicles (vehicles at Level 4
on the scale established in NHTSA’s 2013 preliminary policy statement).

Then Techrepublic says:
> Level 5: It should be noted that some organizations, like the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), have their own charts that refer to ""Level 5"" vehicles.

I think the author of the tech republic article didn't realize that the systems are not directly interchangeable (A NHTSA level 4 vehicle is not necessarily a SAE level 4 vehicle).  Thus, if their source says a level 4 vehicle is fully autonomous (by NHTSA) and they have a source with 5 levels, then the 5th level must have no human controls, even if neither source said that.

Another day, another journalist that publishes a story without the correct facts."
"Google already has it.  Tesla has it, but people like you demand more testing, which they will have through enabling it on all the cars already sold [like they did with their level four autopilot].

The only part that is not here right now is YOU and all the other people who are not ready to let the car drive itself."
"That only looks at the E-class vs. the Model S.  Again, it depends what you consider ""ahead"".  The self-driving S-class prototypes are inarguably better than the Model S, but Tesla isn't very transparent with what they're testing."
"Right. I'm a little worried that's what this is. 

No one has anything close to a fully autonomous vehicle on the road without 5 corner radar. Most don't even have something without LIDAR.

Even Comma.ai, to my understanding, is using data from the three front facing radar units on their Acura. "
We waited a year for autopilot functionality and there was no class action.  There were a lot of disgruntled Tesla owners on TMC though.
"Software's really the major piece, though, right. I could hook up a bunch of sensors and sell you a autonomous capable car today. But that doesn't guarantee it'll ever work or get regulatory approval. 

What happens if, two years from now, the government decides these sensors aren't sufficient to achieve approval? And Tesla's been taking buyers money for the feature? A giant class action lawsuit is what, fine print or no. 

I'm excited about what this means for autonomous driving, but worried about what it could mean for Tesla if things don't go well. They haven't even been able to get their cars officially for sale in all 50 states yet. "
"That's not really true, then. Automated collision avoidance systems started making it into production vehicles a full ten years earlier in 2002 and 2003.

I assumed they meant the Model S launch in 2012. 

Hard to say. Either way, probably not accurate. "
"The difference is that I can see way further back in my mirror then 100m. I checked this morning and a rough estimate is more like 200-300 meter. On those parts on the Autobahn where really fast driving is more common it should be even more.
Of core I don't see many details, but you see if there is something approaching and then you can take a view moments to make a decision.
Reaction time isn't really the problem, but having the information to make the decision to switch the lane."
"I was watching the demo video again and you get a good understanding of what the camera can see at 00:49 and 01:38. The vehicles at 01:38 seem quite blurry when they are at the edge of what the camera can see. Im not super happy with what you can see there, but I have no idea what the AI will make of it.
I hope there will be more information once the first vehicles run on the new Enhanced Autopilot (which Im guessing is using the Rearward Looking Side Cameras in question) in the wild.


At least they say that the Enhanced Autopilot will ""see fast-approaching vehicles in adjacent lanes.""."
Read everything under that section along w the supercomputer product page. Then go to the dev section and read the docs. Its basically the exact same thing.
"'Enhanced Autopilot' and 'Full Self-Driving Capability' are clearly listed as two separate options. The latter shows 'Requires Enhanced Autopilot'.

No new hardware will be required - hence this entire press release.

I'm not sure which part of:

> as of today, all Tesla vehicles produced in our factory – including Model 3 – will have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability

you don't understand."
"dude, are you not understanding the issue? this is not the same thing. there is no feature that any car company provides that asks you to pay money to ungovern the top speed of a car. you'd have to go aftermarket and that would be illegal.

the issue is selling a feature that can potentially never be used at all. it's being sold as 'Fully Autonomous' on top already enhanced auto-pilot."

"Have you ever been to freshly snowed road, lets say, in Canada? I'm asking, because maybe you haven't and your impression of ""snow conditions"" is the version of ""xmas snow"" from movies. (no disrespect, it was just my observation from people who haven't seen snow).

The reason I am asking this, is because snow **can** be very difficult. It's reflective and coats the entire road. I've been in situations where even for me, a well trained human, it is difficult to tell where the road ends or starts. If it's at night during a major snow fall in Quebec on Ontario, before plows go through, it's just a coat of white...

Unless, of course, Tesla could see through snow, which it, of course, might with all the sensors. In which case it'd be amazing!"
EXACTLY! :) I cant wait!! :)
"That's not true.  There is an Uber employee in the driver seat.

Aren't there like 3 technicians around?
Honestly I was a bit surprised they are sticking with that idea.  It seemed like a good idea but also like it was such a silly idea that I never thought they would roll them out.  It'll be interesting to see for sure haha.
"Huh? I'm not sure there's even one factual statement in there. It's uncanny. 

Both systems have had exponential growth this year, so they're not dying off. Android Auto is in the marketppace and has vehicles shipping with it today. Several models received CarPlay software updates this year, including the XC90. Both systems operate by utilizing a dumb terminal layer on the car that merely displays the UI being generated on the phone and passes the taps back to the device. 

It's like you purposefully set out to be wrong on every single point you made. "
Some data does not allow you to draw a valid comparison if the system is better. You don't know the 	dark figure.
"It is a pretty hefty payment for sure. I am on the same boat. Can afford it, can't justify it. Which is why I am waiting for the Model 3 :)"

Joke comment of the day from the armchair CEO.
"So far what I am seeing is that he is often late, but he also frequently delivers.

Point is, if he does deliver, even if not on schedule, the world we know it will change significantly, not in a decade's time, but within 5, at least in the West....
"
"And it isn't even very good. Still isn't a very good driver. Making a car that works in even 99.9% of situations humans drive in is very, very difficult and likely will take at least 5 years. "
"Ahh okay. If they start cranking out a lot of these new models, the price should drop quite a bit on the radar tech? 

I'm excited about the thought of radar in everything. 

Need neural net garbage can that will take itself to curb and navigate the fog and crappy sports equipment littered in driveway"
"Me: Oh, drive me to taco Bell then? 
Telsa: fucking meatbags, starting autopilot. "
"Yes, they could, but they don't, and if the industry is behind they will try to stall until they can catch up."
"Sure. But *current car manufactures* can’t do it and that’s what counts. Look at them, they’re not even able to match current Autopilot in quality (2nd best system on market is twice worse than Tesla’s). Can you imagine them competently developing autonomous cars? I can’t. It’s telling that the one non-Tesla company doing serious autonomous driving work is freaking *Google*.

It’s in the best interest of large car manufacturers that autonomous driving doesn’t happen… not just yet. And they are huge, financially and politically *powerful* companies. They employ tons of people, they have lobby power. Don’t be surprised when Germany pushes to severely regulate autonomous driving in the entire EU. It’s no coincidence that Germany is pressuring Tesla into renaming Autopilot either."
Maybe he's referencing an old world v new world type of battle. 
Autonomous gas cars don't make economic sense to build. Why you ask? Fuel costs.
"Which means you first have to prove AP is safer than humans. FYI, that proof can't be based on private data and we already know EM can't be trusted to be honest about APs actual safety or capabilities."
"If there were a bet in Vegas for this I would bet everything I have against it.

Way too many lobbyists against it. Insurance, police unions, prison unions. Anyone who makes money off duis will throw money at it to keep the status quo and the money flowing. Just look at pot legalization , everyone knows it's stupid but it still isn't legal after 90 ish years"
"Can cars differentiate between a child and a paper bag yet?  
I hope they at least got better with cars stopped in the left lane on highways."
"Remindme 3 years?  We'll see!  

It's hard to say.  Law can move very quick in the right situation.  When Tesla has 1M+ cars on the road, have logged billions of miles with AP hardware, it's going to put enormous pressure on people to get the laws updated."
"From searching, autoland has been an option on 737s for 40 years.  If it lacks autoland, it is because the customer didn't pay for it and opted for an assistive HUD display instead because it was cheaper.

The autoland is used to enable landings in bad weather that a pilot could not otherwise do.  So I am sure some airlines 30 years ago felt they didn't need it or bad weather is rare enough to take the delays instead.  But today, they all will have it since it will be built into standard auto pilot.

I will also say, I am talking about commercial airlines (737+), not private jets and small aircraft.  Commercial airlines buy bigger planes and will have the most features.  An inability to land for a commercial airline wastes more money than a private jet.

Not an animation but [Sam Harris talking about AI](https://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_can_we_build_ai_without_losing_control_over_it?utm_source=tedcomshare&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tedspread) fascinated me.
"Seriously though. 

What have companies, cooperations, or governments shown that makes people think we're on the verge of entering an automated wonderland where people hardly have to work?

The savings companies get from switching to automation, aren't going to find their way into the pockets of workers and consumers. "
"In canada I've seen it happen.. not blowing through it, but stopping right at the intersection so all 4 ways can see him and stop too, then he continues through the red light. And traffic resumes as normal. It's really common."
They do it all the time around here in Michigan in the US. Notably they do it slowly however. They'll start laying on to their horn (very very loud) and drive through the intersection slowly and then floor it out of the intersection.
"They can change the red lights to green a lot of the time, I know. You shouldn't be going into an intersection if an ambulance is coming perpendicular, even if you have the green."
Ah Yeah. I've never heard it called that. 
"A map wouldn't have the accuracy I'd want, plus it'd need to include positioning. Honestly I think emergency vehicles will keep their controls in some form. "
"I'm talking about ambulances. We aren't going to Uber those, and we park them in specific ways, ie on the highway we will want to block traffic, unless someone else is already blocking traffic, in which case we want to pull up in a way that puts the back door closest to to patient. "
"Fantastic post mate!

Of the 3 options, I can see a whole lot of ""2"". By 2100 Africa's population will be higher than Asia. Nigeria alone will have 750 million. Even if we do halt climate change to its levels right now, and we can't, the competition for resources based on current aspirations is a spanner in the works. This means pressure on the current economic equilibrium, let alone the automated utopia.

Telsas automation is fantastic and I welcome it, but I am concerned about those who see a change as painless as the end of the horse. Lets say in 5 years, municipalities start having 'automated vehicle only' precincts. Sections of highways will follow. Even with car sharing, there still needs to be a lot of cars to deal with the volumes - and this means significantly cheaper price points. It also means access to resources that the US may not find so easy to access.

Times are changing. Turkey and Russia are allies for the first time ever. The Philippines today cut military and economic relations with the US. We must be thoughtful and vigilant. ""May you live in interesting times"", sounds enticing, but it was actually a Chinese curse."
"True, at least I think that will be the case at first.. But if I let my Tesla do one fare a day by itself, at $30 per trip, it would pay for itself completely.

I imagine that if it does appear to be profitable there will be a TON of cars available for hire. I know I would personally do whatever I could to buy as many Teslas as I could, as fast as I could, to start renting them out.

5 fares a day at $20 each would be 3,000 a month per car. If you give each car 2 hours per fare (driving, hitting a supercharger, waiting around), at $20 per ride, you'd be hitting 6k a month per car (minus whatver tesla takes from that). And since there is no driver involved you could realistically charge $10-$20 per ride and actually make a profit.. and NONE of the traditional taxis could compete.

Just my thoughts, anyway."
I never said it was smart or safe.  I just wonder how long until... 
"Not arguing the safety or that if it's smart.  Just wondering how long until someone wants to save $8000 and use a jailbreak. That's a lot of money and say someone buys a used Tesla but can't really afford the software upgrade. Or they just want to bend the rules and save some money...  It's gonna happen.  It's just a matter of time. 

Also, what are Tesla's responsibilities if they don't recognize when it happens or have some way to prevent it?  It's potentially dangerous, as you said.  Will they disable the cars? Disable the features?

We won't know until it plays out and we know more about how it works, but it's going to happen.  Instead of stating the obvious of how dumb an idea it *may* be I was just trying to start a discussion about potential scenarios and ramifications of having a software update control so much of a car."
I think they made that offer with the nose cone change iirc
"Eh, I mean it was a half-joke (mainly trying to make myself feel better) so it's totally understandable :)

And I guess I could see that, especially if you're really planning to buy soon. It's kind of crazy that you have to pay more for hardware that the software can't use yet- but in my mind it's a small price to pay for future-proofing. If this is really the M3 hardware then you can hopefully expect it's not going to change for at least 2 years.

That said, if you want the old hardware I'm sure there are deals to be found!"
"> ""well this sucks, but it makes me feel better that those other bastards who waited have to part with an additional $5k to upgrade! Serves 'em right!""

Ha! Ok, I can see that- but yeah definitely not what I meant :) More like ""they're getting much better hardware, of course it will cost more"". More than anything I was just trying to alleviate the depreciation pain for recent buyers.

The people I feel really bad for are the ones who paid an extra $500 for AP1 ... I mean, why on earth did Tesla jack up the price of AP right before making it obsolete? I was ""lucky"" that I ordered way back in July (delivery took forever) so I paid the original $2500, but I still don't understand that particular move. 

Nor, for that matter, Tesla releasing their best, most expensive model ever just before this update. People paid $160k for their P100DL's and now they're obsolete? That's just .. ouch.

> You feel cheated because you had no way of knowing this was right around the corner

Now to be fair, thanks to people like /u/FredTesla I was at least suspicious that this was coming. I grappled very hard at the beginning of September with the possibility of postponing delivery until AP2, but ultimately decided not to base my decision on rumors, I had waited long enough (years...) and really wanted the car. I knew that at some point this decision would come back to bite me- but after the AP price increase and 100's came out I kind of breathed a sigh of relief. ""No way"", I thought, ""would Tesla possibly release AP2 right after this"" .. I was wrong, and that brief respite from worry is possibly what is making this sting all the more.

> You do bring up a good point about depreciation, but honestly, I would expect a considerable amount of that with any brand new car.

Yeah.. this is true. Maybe this is a drop in the bucket compared with the initial 20% hit I took when driving it off the lot. I don't really plan on selling it ever (though I guess now I'm contemplating some future trade-in) so this is more just a technical point for me anyway.

Ok, well thanks for hearing me out and having a civilized discussion with an over-emotional person on the Internet. What a rarity! I should probably stay off this sub for a while until I calm down about all this :D"
"They've publicly wanted to get rid of drivers for years now. The only people still driving for them either can't do math, aren't connected well and don't know Uber hates them and wants them gone, are desperate, or just don't care and want people to see their awesome wheels. Think about that when you order up! "
"Because business. Find another self driving car to buy then, or build it yourself. The spoils from self driving cars is so great, there is no point in manufactures giving other businesses the benefits.

Just because you want, does not mean you get. That's capitalism."
"Tesla thus far has been more than reasonable in most of their most important decisions. I have no reason to believe this will be any different, so I'm going to reserve judgement until the details are announced."
"Full charge + full tank of gas is 500-600KM. 

I charge at home, drive 50KM to work, plus in to a 120V outlet at work, I have a full charge when I'm done the work day and drive home. I do a bit more than 100km per day fully electric. In winter the range goes down and I use about 1.75 litres on that 100km commute.

But if you are going to do 200km a day, every day. You might want to do the math between the Volt and a regular Prius. The Prius may work out cheaper overall."
Thanks for clearing that up! 
"Lol I'm all for it man! I'm really excited. But to say that it is 100% ready when Elon himself said it isn't is shortsighted. If there are any issues with the rollout the public push back will be huge. They've got one chance to nail it, and I want them to get it 100% right. If that means they take an extra year to test those .01% edge use cases,  then I'm all for that. When Elon is confident it's ready for full rollout, I'll be confident and fully behind his decision. "
"Also, they don't currently have level 4 AP, they have level 3."
That is a good point.
Yes it is but I was just pointing out that Tesla is using their own Software even though they are doing the same thing. I'm curious to see how the Vision stacks up against Nvidia. I'm assuming Vision will be better due to the sheer amount of data it will be fed
Please go look at the order page before accusing me of not understanding. I'm also just parroting back what Tesla clearly states. 
"That was already the case with the previous Summon, dude.

> there is no feature that any car company provides that asks you to pay money to ungovern the top speed of a car.

Not so unusual as one might think. Typically for the extra cash they reprogram the engine management computer (effectively the same as removing the governor), put some different wheels on, change a bit of interior trim then call it an 'S' or Sport model."
Do you think all software should be free or something?
"No, you don't understand. 

The value is in the software. The cameras are easy, the hard part is the work to create a self-driving car system. That's why you pay for the software and not the cameras. "
So they'll not own a car for the track. It's that simple.
"I have.  You are right that its difficult,  but the larger picture is that It makes improvements for hundreds of thousands of people at once who likely aren't good in snow. It's sensors are now far more data rich then your ears and eyes will ever be,  and it can be trained and improved enmass,  with almost no human time spent to do so. 

Its a hard problem, but automated cars now have the tools and processes to do a much better job than us. That is why  automated cars will win. "
"Where self driving vehicles will win in these circumstances is with super accurate gps and maps, you don't even need to be able to see where the road is with cameras.

It would see the through the snow using the ultrasound sensors in the car and using gps and maps to map the road ahead. 
"Android auto is completely dead.  It doesn't exist anymore.

Carplay doesn't really exist either.

>Both systems operate by utilizing a dumb terminal layer on the car that merely displays the UI being generated on the phone and passes the taps back to the device.

Cute, but no.  They have their own interfaces that only display apps designed to display on the android auto interface.  They are not just pass through windows showing the raw screen of the device.

Apps that are coded to work with them, don't work with them.  That is why they died.  People are just sticking with mounting their phone on their dashboard connected to the car's stereo with bluetooth."
"I'm not saying ""some data"" can prove that ""the system is better"", just refuting your point that it won't provide any data.  Sorry if I'm being pedantic but I think there are categories of events that this definitely can detect.  

But to play devil's advocate, certainly, they might *not* report times when the auto-pilot would go haywire and drive off a cliff, were it on."
"Very good point. It will take a lot of time.

My guess is that it will be a lot safer and that insurance companies will push it hard thru. They will drop prices for autopilot driven cars."
">If a driver slowed down and the system didn't detect something...

If the system is failing at detecting things sometimes, it will eventually crash somewhere within the millions of miles worth of data. However, if every time the car crashes the data shows that autopilot would have prevented the crash, you can draw a valid conclusion the system is better."
Yup! Same here! 
Uhm ok? It's a fact and a pattern...

I'm sure you could just program a macro on one of those Amazon warehouse robots to do the same.
"I think part of the confusion is the difference between RADAR and LIDAR.  Radar is the older technology, less precise (in terms of resolution) but capable of ""seeing"" through fog and rain. It works based on bouncing radio waves.  It is also significantly cheaper than LIDAR, which is a much newer, much higher resolution technology, but is *not* capable of penetrating fog and rain. It works based on reflecting lasers.  Tesla's systems (both previous and new versions) are based on RADAR (plus cameras and ultrasound), but Google's system is based on LIDAR, and is thus much more expensive..

In Tesla's newer system, they have (among other things) added software techniques and allow them to get more precision from their RADAR than before, but still not quite as much as LIDAR) "

EDIT: if there's going to be any pushback (there will be), it'll be from professional drivers and dealerships. Not ICE manufacturers who are working to develop the *exact same technology.*"
"Yes they do. Infiniti has ""autopilot"" tech."
"They may have tech similar to 'autopilot' like emergency braking assistance, adaptive cruise control, lane assist, etc... but I haven't seen any that are progressing towards self-driving. This is baffling to me. Lexus I think had pre-crash technology where the car knew it would crash and they would prime the airbags, lock the seat belt, and apply slight braking, but still let the car crash. Why not stop it from crashing in the first place? My thought is: fear of lawsuits, or more sinister, that you will need to buy a new car, maybe a Lexus, since the last one saved your life :) It's this kind of thinking that makes me believe they will try to use their legal influence to stop someone more progressive like Tesla."
"> But current car manufactures can’t do it and that’s what counts.

They're working on it. They realize it's the future, so they're not exactly sitting on their laurels waiting to die.

Yes, absolutely. Or more likely, someone like Google will perfect their technology and license it out.

> It’s in the best interest of large car manufacturers that autonomous driving doesn’t happen… not just yet

Why the hell not? It absolutely is, if they want to remain relevant. And they do.

> Don’t be surprised when Germany pushes to severely regulate autonomous driving in the entire EU.

Germany is not a car manufacturer. I could see the legislative body of virtually any country pushing for the same thing.

The only people who don't want autonomous cars are professional drivers and dealers. Frankly I don't feel for either of them. I'd rather have the future."
"The ones fighting for the old world would be professional drivers (taxi, truck, etc) and dealerships though, not ICE manufacturers or oil interests. If anything, a) ICE manufacturers will develop their own tech so people have a reason to actually buy their new cars, and b) oil interest have incentives to fight for (or at least not fight against) the tech because autonomous driving = cheaper and easier to drive = more vehicle miles driven = more fuel sold."
But what does autonomy have to do with it? The economy equation is exactly the same.
"Huh? That makes zero sense. So autonomous ICE cars don't make economic sense because they have fuel costs, yet human-driven ICE taxis that have both fuel *and* labor costs do?"
"I'd take that bet.  Look at trucking companies.  They can save 200,000 bucks per year by replacing human drivers with robots.  there will be plenty of money on the pro autonomy side.  If they can show statistically they are safer than humans it will be a certainty in 5-10 years

"if 5 is fully autonomous, then 4 would be highway, and we have that right now...so...4?  Otherwise, 3, which is still already further along than you would have ever imagined."

I've looked at the order page and read through what Tesla has stated. There is no new hardware needed between the cars being built today and fully self-driving cars. The hardware is standard on all cars.
"Summon is not a standalone charged feature by tesla. Also, summon's most practical and usable features are when on private property e.g. your home. You keep bringing poor analogies to the table here."

Further, it's not ""cute"", that is... literally... how they both work. You're right that they don't do raw mirroring of the standard phone display. The reason they can't do that is because it is specifically against the law in the United States. You cannot put a display capable of displaying video while in motion within view of the driver.

> Germany is not a car manufacturer.

You seem to not realize just how *huge* auto industry is in Germany and how much influence it has. Anything that significantly harms a major industry like that also directly harms the state’s budget (not to mention eventually increased unemployment, always a *very* sensitive issue and major political point in EU).

"When cars are fully autonomous they we will be the work horses of society. It is likely that people will not own them and will have a subscription to a car service; like Uber for example. The reason it is more beneficial to use electric cars is that they have less moving parts and therefore require significant less servicing costs. The cost of electricity is also much less than gas. Furthermore at slow speed electric cars are more efficient too, so they will get even more miles per charge.

So if you wanted to set up an autonomous fleet that is constantly active 24 hours a day, the costs of maintenance and fuel will be significantly less for electric vehicles. Especially in cities!"
"Most autonomous taxis are likely to be electric because of fuel costs. The faster we get to a world of transportation as a service, the worse for ICEs."

I used to think that, but I have been convinced otherwise. Firstly, these test precincts won't be large in area and I actually think it will happen in Europe first. One the benefits in safety and reduced traffic snarl are demonstrated, the rollout will be rapid.

The question is about an owner hacking their own car so physical access is a given.

"So I understand that they are using the Titan GPU and that Nvidia is offering the same thing as them. But Tesla isn't using their drive platform nor are they are using their platform.

"I agree that cars are expensive.  Hopefully with Tesla Mobility services  some people may be able to use that instead of purchasing a car.   The money that's spent on that software is helping to pave the way for Model 3 (Model Y, truck and semi production) so it's going toward good things.  
""if you've paid for the car, you should get all the software.""  
I can't agree with this logic though.  If I buy a TV, I'm not automatically entitled to all programming content.  Software is a separate thing.   Also, in the Tesla you still do get some benefits from the autonomous hardware even if you don't pay for the software.  All the safety features are included for free.

You are crazy if you don't think it is dead.  Showing it on the phone is an admission that in-dash is dead.

"If we look at the data of every single crash that happens in a Tesla over millions of miles, it will show that the crash was either the drivers fault or the systems fault.

"> The reason it is more beneficial to use electric cars is that they have less moving parts and therefore require significant less servicing costs.

This is where I don't agree. Sure, they have less moving parts, but that doesn't by definition translate to lower service costs. The electric cars have the biggest service cost of all: replacing the battery. It is very difficult to get exact prices, but estimates I've seen for the Model S seem to hover around $25,000 for a replacement, and something that's going to be in use as a taxi will probably need that before the end of the first year. Further, unless you take time out of the taxi's service to slow charge it, all the fast charging you do will drastically decrease the battery lifetime. "
"Well first, autonomous still doesn't have much to do with it. The calculations are the same, though some parts of cars as a service may favor it, though other don't.

The biggest considerations are charge time and long term battery life. Fast charging is quite bad for the life of a battery, and for a car that's going to be in use pretty much all day, you either have to accept it being out of service for a longer period of time, swap out batteries, or take the hit to battery longevity. And that's where we hit the other snag. Various sources seem to put the average miles driven by a taxi per year between 80k and 100k. It seems that is actually somewhat close to when many Tesla batteries have to be replaced, which likely costs ~$25,000 for Tesla. 

Also, it will take probably at least another decade before electric cars become competitive on cost, as the cheapest electric cars with decent range are the model 3 and the bolt, both around $35k, whereas a typical prius taxi often costs <$20k. I think we'll eventually get there, but there are a lot of roadblocks, and the math isn't quite as simple as you make it seem. "

All cameras are included on all vehicles. Read the line where the option mentions 'x active' cameras. I thought the same as you before I went back and read carefully.  :)

"I like how your argument changed over time, culminating in a ""Look how dead it is! They're adding new features to it!"" post. 

>But they aren't doing that for some strange reason.


Gee. I wonder if the reason might be in the post you replied to? Hmm..."
"> Would that not be valid?

No, because you can't tell how many crashes the system would have cause that the driver handled without an incident.

If the driver stopped for a pedestrian how do you know the car would not have run over the pedestrian."
Self-driving cars are not pizzas.
Why do you use so many periods...
"Not sure I buy the $25,000 number. That would be what, $300/kWh on an 80 kWh battery? If this is in 5 years (and despite the hype of this thread, level 5 isn't coming any faster than that), I'd expect a figure of more like $100/kWh. 

Plus, the depleted batteries might have a second life as a powerwall: https://about.bnef.com/landing-pages/new-life-used-ev-batteries-stationary-storage/

And the reason autonomous is important is that presumably these autonomous taxis will have very high mileage rates (= fuel savings), but maybe you're right that a Prius that can get 50mpg would be more economical."
"> There will be too much emotional pushback from people who want to drive, I mean that's the entire reason there is a luxury car market, right?

Sure, its also the reason some people still have horses despite this happening a century ago:

I am sorry you feel out of sorts. I hope your day gets better."
"I get that that's what the press release implies. However, Full Self Driving Capability is listed on Tesla's website as an option. Seriously, GO LOOK. ""Enhanced Autopilot"" software is $6k. The option below that is hardware for ""Full-Self Driving Capability,"" which is listed at an additional $4k hardware option. 
"
"I think you are probably right. The fact that the autopilot is a software upgrade is explicitly noted on Tesla's website, but not so regarding the FSDC confused me. I think you are right. It is just software, and by default only 4 cameras are active, yet 8 are going to be installed from now on. "
[deleted]
"I had to add that because you don't understand the difference.

Apple doesn't do car play on the phone.  No where in this conversation are you defending android auto by saying you can use the interface on your phone.

You are talking android auto and carplay being built into cars.  Both of those things are DOA.  Hell, android auto in cars never really happened to begin with.

At least you admit I am right, in dash is dead because it isn't popular enough and can't keep up with the phones.

The version on the phones themselves isn't much better in popularity, people just use the normal apps or car modes built into the normal apps."
"There are 4 scenarios that matter here:

1. 100% autopilot 

2. Autopilot overridden by human

3. 100% human 

4. Human driver hypothetically overridden by autopilot

All of these can be seen in the data. 

1. Obviously any crash entirely at fault of the autopilot is already being closely watched.

2. This can be seen by taking any instance where human input caused the vehicle path to differ from the Autopilot planned path, then checking to see if there would have been a crash.

3. This is simply recording what happened when there was a crash,  but autopilot was not in use.

4. This one can be seen by running the autopilot all the time, then if the human crashes, see if the autopilot would have avoided it.
"
If the driver stop for a pededtrian then you can look what the autopilot might have done. If autopilot would have run over the pedestrian then it is pretty clear software is defective. If autopilot crash then you can used data to recreate the event and determined if human could have prevented it.
"Because if the car never hits a pedestrian, you know the car doesn't run over pedestrians."
"Yeah, delays in the technology sector are very common and definitely not unheard of. You are doing something that has never been done before, after all."
"The thing that pisses me off the most is that I'll have to wait prove you wrong.

RemindMe! 20 years ""I told you so"""
"I've seen the site. I've read the site. I know what it says.

Nowhere in the 3 paragraphs of option text does it say that new hardware will be installed. It very heavily implies that four previously-inactive cameras will now be used for self-driving purposes, but it does not state that four more cameras will be installed.

The state of play as it appears is:

1. All Tesla vehicles come with all second-generation Autopilot hardware standard.
2. All Tesla vehicles come with second-generation Autopilot safety features (e.g. automatic braking) standard.
3. For AU$7500 (not sure on US pricing), you get the driver assistance features including Autosteer, lane change, Summon, cruise control and Autopark.
4. For a further AU$4500 (not sure on US pricing), you get complete self-driving functionality.

If you think it's any different, please provide solid sourcing."
Again. No. Not what I'm saying. 
"That's ok. You can sink in that ship by yourself. You're the only one here claiming they're dead. Clearly it is you who do not understand how they work, nor how they are deployed. Only in your fantasy land does ""Plut0nian doesn't like the way these features work"" equates with them being dead. Both are rolling out at scale. Both work exactly as I described. I suspect you don't care, but you could easily confirm this fact yourself with the developer documentation.  There's not much more to say beyond that. 

You don't like them because they're not an exact mirror of your phone. We get that. But an automaker can't do what you want because it's illegal. Lots of people do like them anyway, as evidenced by their huge growth the past two years and the new announcements for the 2017 model year. 

Edit:
BTW, here are the lists of supported models for 2017. 
CarPlay: https://www.cars.com/articles/which-2017-cars-have-apple-carplay-1420691737477/
Android Auto: https://www.google.com/amp/amp.androidcentral.com/android-auto-vehicles

Not looking very dead. Many of those are new additions for 2017, as you can see."
How do you check if there was a pedestrian if Autopilot didn't detect it? Do check every occasion where the driver slowed down if there was a pedestrian or not?
"I'm just looking at the USA order page for the Model S or Model X. 

https://www.tesla.com/models/design

No argument about the autopilot. It's a $5k time-of-purchase option or a $6k OTA upgrade in the USA. 

However, for FSDC, Telsa's site mentions going from 4 active cameras to 8, and Tesla makes no mention that this upgrade is available OTA, only that it is available at the time of purchase for $3k or $4k after delivery. 

You think they all come with 8 cameras (plus whatever other sensors), but by default only 4 are active? Thus, the FSDC is just an OTA software upgrade, too? That's possible...if so, I'm surprised Tesla didn't word it like that on the build page. 

Also, sucks for people who just took delivery of new P100s. Looks like they are out of luck on FSDC forever on their current cars--but it seems like Tesla was advertising autopilot and FSDC as one and the same until Tesla's latest press release. "
"I like how you say support.  You have to pay extra to get carplay or android auto and it isn't well supported if you do.  No one is hyped anymore for it.

Most of those models sold will lack carplay and android auto, no one wants to pay 500 dollars extra when you get a better experience using your phone from a holder on your dashboard.

It is also funny that the largest car company isn't listed for any model."
"Log sensor feed everytime driver deviate from autopilot action. You have radar, camera and ultrasonic sensor the probability of pedestrian being invisible in all sensor is very low."
"They would have to ship with 4 idle cameras, otherwise today's press release is an outright lie.

I agree it sucks for recent deliveries, but I don't believe Tesla had promised anywhere that first-gen AP could do full self-driving in future."
"When this conversation started for some reason I thought you actually cared about getting the facts right. I realize now that for some reason you have it in your head that because you don't like something, no one likes it, despite extensive evidence to the contrary. That's silly, but you can do what you want. 

A parting note since you brought it up: Save one, all of the top 5 automakers are shipping their new vehicles with CarPlay and Android Auto. You know why? They're using a competitor called SmartDeviceLink... that, big surprise, also doesn't mirror your phone screen exactly."
Thanks for the info; I had always thought Tesla was marketing autopilot as coming in the near future as FSDC enabled by an OTA software upgrade. 
I have the facts right.  Very few cars have this in it and there is no public desire for it.
"It seems like several media outlets love to jump on (or make up) negative events regarding Tesla. Why is this? They're an American company making cars in America that use American electricity (when driven here in the US). I wish ambitious companies would have more support rather than having to ""swim upstream"" all the time."

"The financial press loves to jump on Tesla because it isnt run by one of ""Their guys""

You know, frat Harvard MBA types who jump into a company all piss and vinegar, cut costs with cheaper labor and materials, then eject with their golden parachutes during the short, temporary stock pump before their customers realize their product/brand has gone to shit."
"CNBC is frequently used to manipulate the stock market. Long time ago someone from the hedge fund industry documented the details how they do it. They first take position, prepare the campaign. They even plan when to publish what at which source to the minutes. It's quite profitable. So right after the CNBC, you can anticipate similar things on other sources such as TheStreet, BusinessInsider, ConsumerReports, etc. Look at the trading volume right after the article. Some of the dumping was part of the manipulation. They wanted to trigger stop-loss orders and start the avalanche. This time they failed because Tesla immediately clarified the CNBC news is wrong."
"People shouldn't be swayed so easily, do research first, but in the stock market, it is gambling"

"The stock market knowledge in this sub is infuriating. If you're surprised at all by movement like this then you clearly have no grasp of volatility or how stocks are priced in. This article is an argument over semantics and how people interpret them. Seriously. That's it. If semantics can move a stock more than you're comfortable with, then clearly the sentiment behind the price is already shaky at best.

Furthermore, in no way, shape, or form, is that a stock ""crash"". TSLA moves 2% in either direction on a daily basis. This is nothing new. Stop trying to play the victim against the media."
"Damn I wish I had $35,000 for one :("
"Their stock actually rose today, closed 5$ higher than it opened.

There is literally no way for Tesla to fulfill all pre-orders by mid 2018 if the SOP is late 2017. That's around 50000 cars per month.
"If it's on the Internet, it must be true."
Would be nice if news agencies were sued for shit like this. Maybe then they would do some actual fact checking before reporting anything. 
Can they get sued?
TSLA stock sale
">CNBC has since updated its headline from “Tesla quietly pushes back delivery estimate for new Model 3 orders to mid-2018 or later” to “If you didn’t order your Model 3 yet, you won’t get it until mid-2018, Tesla says”.

If that's a delay, consider me impressed.  A lot of us were thinking people who didn't order on day one would be waiting well over a year.  This gives hope to those who reserved early on day 1 that the wait might not be quite so bad."
OH BOY DISCOUNT!!!
I love these financial headlines. A stock crash is now a momentary drop of 2%? So pretty much every stock in history has crashed every day.
Can CNBC be sued?
It's almost like they ment to do that
That's just an opportunity to buy stock at a cheaper price.  
People need to learn how to read/comprehend!
I don't mind Tesla not spending money on commercials. I know a guy spends hours on net but told me that Tesla is made in Sweden. It took me a while to convince him it's MADE IN USA and he seemed quite delighted to hear that. I don't care about the media. 
"Just another in a long long line of ways the ""Main Stream Media"" lies and perverts the truth."
OH MY GOD THAT EVIL MEDIA SENT THE STOCK CRASHING - CRASHING I TELL YOU! HOW WILL THEY EVER....annnd it closes up 2%

Why does it really feel like the media *really* wants Tesla to fail? It's very strange and it seems like the biggest news about Tesla are people lying about problems with Tesla cars
A major news network rushes out a story and fucked something up?! This is new for them! (No it's not)
I am guessing Tesla does not advertise on CNBC...
So now is the time to buy Tesla stock?
It was up $5 today.
"This is great for me.  I was actually looking for an updated expected delivery date to decide whether I would pre-order or not.

I may do that now since 2018 makes more sense for me financially (when my current car loan is completed)."
Shurley they can sue for misrepresemtstion and loss with this by americam standards?
Pretty much nothing has happened to Tesla stock since the big run up in 2013. It's just very noisy. 
"Tesla stock is volatile anyway, so it's no surprise that little things will rock its stability a bit. Thing that I wonder is, why are investors so edgy about news that comes from an outside source first? Could this 2% or so just be those that are in it for gains, trying to avoid any loss? Let them get nervous and sell then. Anyone in with Tesla for the long haul isn't going to care about the usual fluctuations as things progress."
I feel like CNBC should in some way be responsible for this. The stock did not fully recover after the article. Judging by the screenshot in this article the stock was much higher before the CNBC article than it was after. 
That was so disgusting.. What a terrible job CNBC.
Ironically I'm hoping to reserve in Dec/Jan so its nice to know when I could expect the vehicle.
"Electrek is not much better than most other media outlets with its headlines. A 2% drop is barely a crash. The linked stack chart doesn't show the Y axis so the reader can't see how big the drop actual was. Overall Tesla is almost 2% up today. 
And the change from ""delivery"" to ""production"" indicates a delay despite the official response."
Will there be any consequences for CNBC?
"If that reaction to that specific change on their website wasn't obvious to people at Tesla, whoever approved it probably should be fired.

"Probably because they're trying to curb our reliance on oil and those who want to keep society stagnating and destroy the environment while they reap profits aren't cool with someone bucking their quest for world domination or whatever. 

Let's just say that the profit driven media corporations which have a stake in maintaining the status quo of our oil dependency maybe aren't the best people to be telling us the news."
"Because we live in a time where journalistic integrity is sacrificed for corporate profit. Sometimes the ""big story"" just doesn't exist, so news outlets can simply create one. "
"To paraphrase Jon Stewart, the media bias towards sensationalism is usually much stronger than its bias for or against any given position. 

My guess is sloppy reporting and looking for stories explains a lot more negative coverage than meddling from major sponsors/other car companies. "
2 worlds oil lobbying. 
The media is in bed with big oil.  Tesla is disrupting big oil.
"Just this morning, I overheard the local news say something about Tesla. Which was followed by them saying something to the effect of, remember that guy that was killed in Florida driving a Tesla... 

Irregardless of good or bad news, there always seems to be some kind of dig fed to the people. "
"Because people are Twats that love to shit all over true innovators.  Then copy them and call it better, when it isn't."
big oil 
"I treat it like a concentrated effort to manipulate Tesla stock to make it affordable for the rest of us. Frankly said, I love it. Got a bunch of buy orders filled."
It's probably put out there so the stock crashes and then someone who wants to buy the stock can do it at a discount.
Stock market manipulation?
"Cynicism is easy, and is never viewed as harshly as naivete, even when it's just as blind."
"People love to hate anything new and ambitious because they're being ""realistic""."
Media has small balls and likes the attention 'sassy' headlines garner.
The media and journalism is shit for the most part these days. They'd do anything for clicks and money. 
"Talking negative about Tesla is a very easy to get lots of ad views. 

It's all about the money. "
Especially with the clickbait autopilot feature stories.
"It has nothing to do with the medias beliefs and everything to do with who owns that media outlet, and what other companies they own. They for sure have investments or ownership of oil and other car companies. "
"These media companies live off the dealerships and other car companies. Almost every other commercial on TV is for cars and Tesla doesn't advertise, doesn't have dealerships that advertise.  

While at this point Tesla isn't really hurting the old guard, the Model 3 could start to change that. It could also ""give ideas"" to others and that's a big risk to media companies"
Because the existing car companies do media buys in obscene quantities.  They don't want to upset their biggest advertisers.
it's a crappy way of getting attention.  it probably works.  still crappy.
"It doesn't matter either way. If it indeed sends the stock crashing down, then smart money will eventually figure out that it was due to a false report and will be happy to buy at lower prices. This demand will send the price back into the original range. Maybe not always exactly like this, but more or less."
"Maybe they do it because most people can't relate to Tesla. Tesla has a reputation for being only for wealthy people (although they are moving away from that), so maybe middle and lower class people (subconsciously) enjoy seeing negative reports about them.
Just speculation."
Because the media loves the status quo.

Technically it could be Canadian energy powering an electric car
"For the media there is more money in tearing things/people/ideas down than there is in building them up.  And when those things/people/ideas are truly good and noble, the thirst for blood is even greater.  "
"Because all the commercials in betweens segments are from GM, Ford, Toyota, etc. and all your town's local dealers. "
They stand directly in defiance of big oil money which is far more important to the media than patriotism
Because it loses money at the moment and that's relevant to cnbc?
"[It's less American than a Camry or Accord](http://www.american.edu/kogod/autoindex/2015.cfm), so that's not a great counterargument.

But on to the point: anything about Tesla makes news.  People will jump all over news about Tesla, good or bad.  Media outlets report on things people want to hear about, thus Tesla pops up pretty often."
"They make up stories because Tesla is perfect. Besides the self driving crashes, but those aren't technically their fault"
OP's headline is as bad as the CNBC report.
"I was thinking the same thing haha

Yep. Anyone can be sued for anything. But they will win so it's not worth it.
It's a terrible job only in the sense this time they kind of failed the manipulation. They do this all the time. I don't mean it's CNBC. It's a hit job planned by a hedge fund. CNBC will publish whatever as long as they pay for the air time.
"I don't understand the rational to delay reservation. The deposit is fully refundable. If you change mind later, it doesn't hurt anything.

Those who wait until they see the actual car, the wait list probably will way pass one million."
"In terms of the stock movement today, it retraced 100% of the positive movement from the opening today. That's not insignificant. Also check the volume. I'm sure quite a few algo's and stop losses got triggered by this non-story.

Yea seriously in today's world where information is so readily available and distributed via the internet and how fast it can affect a company like TESLA i think a certain degree of accountability is needed to keep media honest

For the most part, these drops are humans reacting to the news and typically you'd find that the HFTs are acting as the counterparty. The HFTs would look, for example, at Panasonic (a major Tesla supplier) to see what it's doing. A sharp drop in both those correlated stocks might be an indication of an issue, but a drop in Tesla without a corresponding drop in Panasonic probably indicates the market is acting irrationally. That's a very simplistic case, but conveys the general idea. "

42k cars that's 2/3 of the Golfs VW makes in Wolfsburg per month in a factory that is fully ramped up using a supply chain and a system that has been setup and optimized over decades. It would be impressive on it's own if they manage to produce that many cars per month by mid 2018.

"> Shouldn't journalists have some sense of responsibility when they have that kind of power?

Should they?  Absolutely.  Will they?  Probably not.  If there's a potential story out there, whoever publishes it first gets the recognition and the clicks, and that's what keeps sites afloat.

And if you want to get into that responsibility, it gets convoluted pretty quickly.  Should there be no reporting on the Model 3 and what features it may have because it might affect the stock?  Should magazines like Car and Driver and Consumer Reports not have deemed it ""car of the century"" and ""best car tested"", respectively?  Should reporting on a fatal accident wait until after the investigations have all concluded before publishing?  Should journalists fact-check and debunk claims like ""safest car ever"" rather than quoting them?  Should reports of a battery fire not be published until a full investigation is done?  Where do you draw the line?

And the biggest question, do your responses to any of those questions change if you replace ""Tesla"" with ""BMW"" or ""Audi""?"

"But if the previous market valuation of $100 was correct, and it only fell to $50 because of an article with flawed information, then it's undervalued at $50 and it ought to be a good buy."
"Another good, related term to understand is ""dollar cost averaging"".

In a nutshell, if you have money to invest and you know you want to put it into Tesla, divide your money up into equal-sized chunks and spend them spread out over time.  You end up with more lower-priced stock and less higher, which is a good thing.
"
"Gladly. Allow me to expand on it a bit with another quote:

>Averaging Down Can Be Rewarding

>Averaging down is clearly something technical traders will not do. A “stop loss” will automatically sell a stock if the price drops to a certain level. To them, stock prices have only one direction. But averaging down is clearly something that value investors should do. You have already bought a stock at higher prices. When the price is lower, why don’t you buy more?

>If you buy the stock at half the original cost, your chance of making a 100% gain is much higher. "
You ever try making any money off of it?
You're a funny kind of crazy my friend.
I wonder how much quality will dip because of that. Teslas seem like cars that take specialists and time to build. Producing at a high quantity and hiring more unexperienced people to do so seems like it would be hard to keep up with their standards.
"Integrity is what I meant. You can report facts, but sometimes they spin a false narrative. Just like this situation: report that the website changed, not that the Model 3 is delayed.

"And that same electric car takes significantly more energy to produce (more ""gallons of gas"", and uses the energy equivalent of 1500 or so gallons of gas over its lifetime, assuming there's no battery replacements in between.

And yes, arguing about how much gas equivalent a car uses so you can claim it's ""more American"" is grasping at straws."
"What you are saying is a bit tautological -- that's the definition of a bargain. The problem is that at the time it's not clear whether they should be selling or not. Sure, it drops 7% and then rebounds, and you, with the benefit of hindsight,  say that they ""shouldn't"" have been selling. But you only say that because you know it rebounded. "
"The problem is that ""information"" is not just news reports on the company. A company like Tesla might be sensitive to a number of external factors  such as commodity prices, exchange rates, interest rates, consumer demand and the performance/outlook of its competition. On top of that you've got things like the Solarcity acquisition, which makes it effectively impossible to have an accurate view of Tesla as a whole unless you are doing this professionally. So I don't think you can avoid being at an information disadvantage by just following a number of sites. A 7% drop was definitely caused by something, it's not like a number of people just suddenly decide to sell enormous amounts of TSLA.  This isn't just Tesla obviously; any publicly traded company is a very complicated thing to keep track of.

I expect, just guessing, that public interest in Telsa will wain, once they're no longer the new upstart, or no longer the only EV game in town. "
"> Integrity is what I meant. You can report facts, but sometimes they spin a false narrative. Just like this situation: report that the website changed, not that the Model 3 is delayed.

Again, that goes back to the list of questions I just asked.  Should news sites report the ""safest car ever"" note as a lie instead of just what Tesla has said?  Should Car and Driver and Consumer Reports retract statements calling the S the ""Car of the Century"" or ""Best Car Ever Tested""?  Or does that only apply when it's something negative?

> Yes, some of my answers do change. For example, I've seen other car brands on fire before, but I've never seen a story about it from them. 

Really?  You've never seen a story about any other automaker having cars catch on fire?  Is that because they're not published or because you aren't looking for them?  Here's one from [literally hours ago.](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/police-officers-lucky-escape-after-9068862)

>Also, have any other lane-keeping features from other companies caused an accident before? You wouldn't know because they don't seem to follow them, even though some are far inferior.

Have any other lane-keeping features been dubbed ""Autopilot"" with the company's CEO saying you can probably read a book while it's on?  That tends to draw more scrutiny than a quiet release of ""DISTRONIC PLUS"" or ""Active Lane Keeping Assistant""."
"> I mean, it certainly seems simple on the surface. If you report inaccurate news without fact checking, and that news, beyond reasonable doubt, directly causes that company to lose money, they should be held responsible monetarily.

But again, say you decide people reporting inaccurate news must be punished.  Are you going to punish Tesla and all the news outlets that parroted them for falsely claiming the Model S is the safest car ever made?

> Much like when Tesla sued Top Gear. Although that incident was obviously 100% intentional defamation, it was dismissed regardless, but that was in UK court.

No, that was a ridiculous lawsuit with no ground to stand on.  You can't sue an entertainment show for making shit up for drama or entertainment.  It's something Top Gear is known for doing, and they've done something along those lines (or worse) to any automaker that has ever sent them a car.

You can't argue that that's inaccurate because it's not a factual statement. Saying that Tesla is pushing back production is 100% factually inaccurate.

So, is it possible that we no longer have enough certainty to oppose any control on freedom of the press? As always, perhaps we should, perhaps we should not. But is it truly something that can be firmly denied with the way the press has changed over time? "
Which is still incredibly irrelevant when we're talking about how much of a car is made in America.
"> It only takes 25% more more energy to make according to the same report.

That's a significant increase.

> Common sense item #1: we import about half our oil, we generate our electricity.

Saying ""we generate our electricity"" makes no sense.  You're being ridiculously specific about everything else, but you're willing to gloss over where the electricity comes from?  Come on.  If you live in the northern half of the US, statistically about 10% of your electricity comes from Canada.  That's a fifth of your oil number without even considering how the electricity is generated and where those resources come from.

> Common sense item #2: an ICE uses about 15 times more energy to operate over it's life than to produce. Thus, not factoring in energy is HUGE. No straws

Not factoring energy into an overall picture is huge, yes.  Not factoring it into an analysis of how much of the car is built domestically is not.  Common sense would be *not* including running cost guesstimates in something explicitly about production."

I already covered this."
">How is ""safest car ever"" not a factual statement?

You haven't defined the term 'safest car', so the statement is meaningless. 

What is a safe car? Is it one that better protects against a frontal collision, or a side collision? What about the car overturning? What about flammability? Does active safety count (effectiveness of brakes, acceleration, cornering)?

On the other hand, to say that “Tesla quietly pushes back delivery estimate for new Model 3 orders to mid-2018 or later” is a statement that is much better defined (except maybe for 'quietly' which is a subjective evaluation), and is either true or false. 

Did CNBC misreport this?Tesla changed their website from ""Deliveries begin late 2017"" to ""Production begins late 2017. Delivery for new reservations is mid 2018 or later"". These are not mutually exclusive statements. It could be that production began in late 2017, with the first deliveries also in late 2017, but due to the backlog of orders any new deliveries won't be delivered before mid 2018. Both statements are thus true. However, the CNBC said they ""pushed it back"", implying that a change took place, i.e. that the new statement on the website somehow modified (and invalidated) the old one.  Which is not the case, because they are logically independent."
