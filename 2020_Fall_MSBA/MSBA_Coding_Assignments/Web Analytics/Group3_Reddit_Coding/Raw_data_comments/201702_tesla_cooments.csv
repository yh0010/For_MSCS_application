"> A German man used his Tesla Model S to slow down a car behind him that was piloted by an unconscious man.

[Link to the story.](http://www.thedrive.com/news/7663/tesla-driver-uses-his-model-s-to-stop-runaway-car-on-autobahn)"
Well that's one way to get a good regeneration charge to those batteries.
"He didn't just bring the guys car to a stop, he got out and performed first aid on him. He saved his life. That guys a hero."
Praise for this selfless action may confuse the network's deep learning algorithms. ..^/^s
"but he had to do something that Germans are programmed from birth never to do: pass in the right lane—a crime right up there with theft, wasting good beer, and putting bacon on Jaegerschnitzel.

lol
"
"Great move by Musk/Tesla to pick up the repair costs.


But... would insurance typically cover damage in this scenario?  If so,  whose?  


My thoughts are the unconscious guy's insurance would pick it up... As the driver ""fails to avoid"" an impact with a car ahead.


But... the Tesla guy is intentionally ""crashing"" his car.
"
"Just after this tweet he made a bit of a grandma move and tweeted these from what I assume are his drafts, and quickly deleted. https://twitter.com/TnG_Adam/status/831971945805705217

Edit: too bad he didn't have any Model 3 news in those drafts. "
"From the actual report:
>but he had to do something that Germans are programmed from birth never to do: pass in the right lane—a crime right up there with theft, wasting good beer, and putting bacon on Jaegerschnitzel.

Being a German, I find this hilarious! I mean... it's true! :-D

/edit: I must admit, I commit this crime pretty frequently whenever I encounter yet another left lane lurker crawling ~~over (across? words...)~~ down the Autobahn at walking speed; why bother trying to wake him up when the right lane is completely free for the next approximately 743,43358 kilometers? So... yes, we're trained to never do that but we're also smart enough to overcome this training in times of great need. "
Free regenerative braking charge 
">Not only did the Tesla driver have to sacrifice his own car (the newspaper says that his Tesla and the Passat suffered about 10,000 Euro in combined damage)

Wtf that's like 190,000 American dollars"
"Anyone else notice how this stuff is only news when a tesla is involved? I mean don't get me wrong, I love tesla, but it's just funny. If this guy was in a dodge it wouldn't even remotely be considered news"
"I wonder. 

Could he have set the Tesla to autopilot. Then leaped from his car to the other man's car. Got in the other man's car and taken control of it. While the Tesla keeps on going until the autopilot stops it."
"There you have it, definitive proof Passats give you strokes and Tesla give you extra bravery."
"Wow, 10 grand for a pair of bumpers? Sheesh. Kudos to the Tesla driver for quick thinking."
"That is awesome.

The first time a self-driving car does this will be even more awesome."

Is there a link to the story?
"He risked his life more than just the car. Stopping a car like that on the highway (in germany where there are no speed limits basically) means that cars coming behind would have seen no stop lights on, or emergency lights blinking. This could have easily ended with them being disintegrated away by someone hitting from behind at 200 kmh..."
"Its a good thing Tesla isn't fully autonomous yet. I could imagine someone disengaging autopilot and doing this manoeuver. The deep learning network at this point [in the future] is learning some new things but has been around long enough to really know most so when something new does happen it pays attention.

Then some poor schmuck on the same road a week later driving at the same speed in same proximity to other cars and autopilot chimes in ""Its go time for that new shit I learned""

(Obviously I know that it doesn't work quite like that. I just thought it was funny.) "
that is fucking courageous. Have you met a Tesla owner on real life? Cant imagine that.
"tesla, please invent magnetic vehicle to vehicle coupling. imagine how spinning out of control and rollovers would stop if both cars would immediately stick to each other. or maybe just tesla police interceptors should have that."
This is why Tesla don't need to run virtually any ads.

"I don't know about Germany but in the US if you've got comprehensive coverage, it *should* cover something like this, from what I understand.  I'm not an insurance guy tho so I could be way off"
Insurance in the U.S. atleast would have the TESLA driver at fault. Nice thing about insurance is that you don't NEED to use it. So he could have the other man offer to pay out of pocket to fix damages to his vehicle because most likely the VW insurance company is going to pay for the scrapes from the guard rail and TESLA insurance company is going to be liable for the bumper damage.

When the speed difference is too large he may notice you a bit late and quickly tries to get out of your way to the right lane (while you try to illegally pass him there).

Or he's just blind and suddenly moves right, maybe because he wants to, or his exit is coming up.

Seriously, don't overtake on the right side, most people get out of the way when possible and if not get a bit closer (don't really ride his bumper though, also dangerous) and turn up your headlights a few times."

That was a total idiot. He risked my and his own life. You are part of this problem. Stop that, you are not clever you are smartassing people into danger"

i guarantee you that a german driving a dodge would make the news aswell
I don't think a driver halting another vehicle on the autobahn is an all too common occurence. I found it rather spectacular.
If it was a Ferrari or a Lambo my guess it would make the news. Those cars are expensive.
"I've been trying to find it but a few years back, someone in the US did the same thing. From what I can recall, he was an engineer or physicist and was driving with his family. He tells them that he's purposely going to cause a crash by matching the speed & stopping the other car with the incapacitated driver. 

The search continues for the article... "
"Faz.net (Internet Portal of a German newspaper) reported ""He used his Elektroauto (car with electricity motor) to stop the other car."" No manufacturer was named. I only read here, that it was actually a Tesla. "

He did post a subsequent tweet saying it was an accident from his drafts. 
"When I pass them on the right, I tots know that I cannot do this like crazy. I never pass them so fast that I couldn't avoid them in case they eventually decided to change the lane. 

How come that saying ""I pass them on the right"" almost always gets interpreted as ""I drive by them like a crazy mofo in a race car on acid""?"
"Ah, I see. Makes sense. Thank you! "
"I'm not passing them on the right the same way like I would pass them on the left! I'm totally aware that they usually pay even less attention to what happens on their right hand lane. I pay them proportionally more attention when passing on the right. Instead of them changing the lane afterwards I often get angry looks and waving fists... Usually I even signal them by using the flashers (which is totally allowed and even encouraged here) beforehand that I intend to overtake and that they should change to the right lane because there's more than enough space so that I can easily overtake  If they still don't give a shit and block the left lane, I don't give a shit either anymore and pass them on the right, paying appropriate additional attention of course and only in situations where I can easily avoid them if they decided to change the lane yet again without taking into account that there might be other traffic participants around. I'm definitely no reckless motherfucker and dumbshit maniac on the road! I have a fucking lot of driving experience (former taxi driver). Believe me, I know what I'm doing! "

We get taught in Germany that the first and most important step is to secure the area by putting up a hazard triangle in some distance and wearing a reflective vest at all times. This is to prevent an already bad accident from going nuclear.
Don't move him into the recovery position when he's been in a car accident though. You will want to leave him in whatever position you found him in because he might have spinal damage and moving it will make that worse. Best you can do is stabilize the neck.

"That alone doesn't guarantee you good drivers. Israel also has a minimum of 28 mandatory lessons with a driving instructor before you can even attempt to take your driving license test, and yet people here mostly drive like shit.

Driving around people who've no idea what they're doing makes you prone to second guessing what people are doing.
"Can confirm. I've lived in Italy most of my life and drivers were decent. I moved to Germany and.. drivers are very good. When I go back to Italy I am constantly tailgated and see shitty drivers make shitty errors.

The under the left lane is for passing... something half of American drivers don't.  
"It's only 12 mandatory hours of practical training though hardly anyone gets away with solely those.

But you certainly can get by with 16-20 hours. The theoretical training isn't 1 on 1 and therefore a lot cheaper.
The costs also vary wildly in Bavaria the average license is around 1800$, while in Berlin it's around 1100$. I'm pretty sure mine was around 1000$ some years ago."
Nicely and with a conscious?
"Not just for the license, although  an 8h(?) first responder training is mandatory for it. Everyone over 18 can be sued for ""unterlassene Hilfeleistung"" if they don't help a person in danger, as long as helping doesn't put you in danger as well. Penalties are fines or jail up to a year."

"Because a lot of people do that, going far too fast and then quickly swerving right, passing and swerving back left.

Overtaking on the right is a lot more dangerous than on the left, there's a far bigger blind spot (due to the driver sitting further away from that side) and the mirror doesn't provide as much view. It's already dangerous overtaking a car this way and suicide with a truck, that's why it's illegal."
Its your decision. I can believe that you are skilled and cautious. But you still need to know that it is illegal and the only correct answer would have been to be patient.

"Right! That's the vibe that I hadn't read initially. Elon's wording seems to wed the ""congrats"" with ""sacrificed damage to his own car"".

"If you're talking about Cruz:

Sure; but, I think Cruz knew what he was doing, as he did it a few times. He's a Princeton undergrad / Harvard Law grad / five-year Texas Solicitor General / five-year UT law professor / five-year U.S. Senator. He knows, in my opinion, that he should be sympathetic to someone who's suffered, especially when under his worldview, that person would've likely suffered far more/died. "

There is nothing wrong with win win. 
I've actually had 3-4 friends that are anti-ev send me this information and they were really impressed. The PR is real.
"Although none of us want to admit it, the fact that Elon is so rare of an entrepreneur that this is a big deal says something about how poorly large  corporations handle situations like this.  "

"In Germany, if you get damages (hurt or something you own gets broken) while helping as a first responder, the insurance company of the state of your origin will cover the cost.

This is set up so that nobody can think ""well, I could get blood on my clothes and who pays me that?"" or is afraid to call the fire department because he may have to pay them if nothing really happened. 

It seems pretty proven in this case that this was done to help, so I guess even if Elon wouldn't have covered it, the German state of the tesla owner would have.

(we had the same topic in the German subreddit about it, a source for that would be [this](http://publikationen.dguv.de/dguv/pdf/10002/erstehilfe-web.pdf). ""Deutsche Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung"" means German statutory(?) Accident insurance. "

In Germany Driver's Ed Schools actually do emphasize the importance of mentality and defensive driving.
"Story time: About 8 years ago before I moved to Germany I was driving from Atlanta to Charlotte at this point I was maybe 2 exits into NC.

 It was an off day not rush hour, I had a commercial van decide it was a great time to cross from the left lane of I-85 all the way to catch their exit in about 1/4 mile going 10 over. 

Collectively as a country we can't drive for shit. "
"Yup, pretty much the polar opposite of middle America (I'm not being unfair- I live there...  People don't even understand a zipper merge or the left lane here, much less how to safely arrest an uncontrolled vehicle, or why they would be *expected* to do so....)"

Conscience fwiw.
"Wouldn't really use ""sued"" as this makes is look like its a civil lawsuit for damages or similiar.
""Unterlassene Hilfeleistung"" is a misdemeanor, which will get you prosecuted. "
"It's not really that it's a dick move, but that it's not what you pay for when you buy insurance. It's meant to protect you financially in case of accidental, unexpected damage. They calculate the rate you pay based on that. This wasn't an accident. I agree that it would suck for a Good Samaritan to be stuck with the bill, but insurance companies have no more legal (or moral, in my opinion) obligation to pay it than anybody else. It would have been very kind of an insurance company to pay for that, just as it's very kind of Tesla to pay for it. Neither of them would be evil for not paying it, though."
"""TESLA are selling big! Not like FAILING chrysler! They stick to oil. BAD!"""
"That's why lurking in the left lane is also illegal. And still it's the ones trying to deal with those assholes who get blamed. If you're being passed on the right, *you* did something wrong. There was obviously enough space to drive in the right lane. Even faster than you. So why didn't you change to the right lane in the first place? The obligation to drive in the right lane also isn't there for no reason!"
"Yeah... in theory I agree. But common sense and rules unfortunately are often mutually exclusive in the field. I feel like it's plain stupid to stick behind some left lane lurker and wait, wait, wait until he wakes up (which depending on the level of left lane lurking never happens). The only completely legal alternative would be to change to the right lane and still stick behind him and wait, wait, wait until he changes as well. I'm honestly sorry but that doesn't work for me. 

In my opinion left lane lurking should be penalized with at least a month of license suspension, 2 or 3 points in the Flensburger Verkehrssünderkartei (traffic offender file), and it should be really expensive. Why? Because due to the prohibition to overtake on the right the left lane lurkers occupy not only the space in their lane but also in the lanes to their right. A motorway only has so much capacity. Someone who crawls down the motorway in the left lane occupies the space of at least two, three, sometimes four cars. They forward traffic jams and thus can even deal some severe economic damage. 

There are reasons for the obligation to drive on the right. And I don't see why those idiots who just ignore it for, aside from pure stupidity and ignorance, whatever else reason I'll never understand (what's so much better about the left lane if the right lane is completely free?), well, I don't see why they should get away with it! They are way less qualified to drive a car than I am. I pay attention while driving. They don't. I am on the road with every fiber of my mind. A look in their face is usually enough to show that in their minds they are anywhere but on the road. 

In the end it's boiling down to the question who's the bigger risk? Someone who's driving faster but is highly focused on the road, pays attention to driving, or someone who's crawling down the road, dreaming of distant worlds? In my opinion, definitely the latter. So take them off the roads and the issues with people thinking like me will vanish as well! Or take people like me off the roads and you'll achieve no improvement in crash statistics at all. 

That's just my opinion. You guys may not like me for it but I've been driving cars for almost 20 years now, have an estimated 400000 to 500000 kilometers on my lifetime trip meter. I know the road. I know the freaks out there. I know the idiots out there. I know that I am an idiot myself sometimes. But I also know what it takes to drive safely. It's **not** just driving slowly and blindly following all the rules all the time. It's driving **consciously**, **considerate** and **focused on the road**, using your brains, your common sense, your experience. Whether that allows sometimes for breaking some of the rules, everyone has to constantly decide for themselves. "

"As others have pointed out, it would've because it has to. People rendering assistance as first responders are automatically covered in all damages to their person or property. They also cannot be held liable for damages they cause, unless it's proven that they acted with gross negligence or malicious intentions.

That's necessary because the law (§323c StGB) says:

>Whosoever does not render assistance during accidents or a common danger or emergency although it is necessary and can be expected of him under the circumstances, particularly if it is possible without substantial danger to himself and without violation of other important duties shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine.

In practise, if you aren't able to help yourself, you are only legally required to call the authorities. But not doing anything will get you in trouble if caught."

"Honestly though, this is why insurance companies are stigmatized. This was a human being literally saving another's life, causing some damage to some sheet metal in the process, and the thought of insurance not helping out is really disappointing.

You also have to ask what ""intentional"" means. If I get in an accident because I swerved away from hitting a person, saving their life, does that mean I ""intentionally"" crashed the car? Where do you draw the line? "
If you took this story on social media and your insurance wasn't covering it they would get roasted publicly until they did. While it's not what you're paying for sometimes going above and beyond should absolutely be normal. In this case it would be something that should happen every time. It won't because muhh capitalism

You dont solve anything by being impatient. He is wrong by blocking the left road. You don't make it any better with that. The correct answer is to be patient and wait for him to change his lane so you can pass him safely. Just imagine 10 other cars who think like you and dont want to be patient. All 10 pass that guy from the right side. What a massive chaos a danger for everyone plus other cars on that track

"First of all, condescension won't get you anywhere in life, so cut that shit out.  

In regards to your point: scale needs to be taken into consideration. Sure, code was stolen. That sucks, but on a scale from ""doing absolutely nothing"" to ""killing millions of people"", it's a lot closer to the former than the latter. 

Finally, does the end justify the means? You may think not, but it's a conversation worth having. Does the end of saving millions of lives due to targeted and well orchestrated donations into vaccines and research justify hampering the livelihood of first-world citizens playing the big-money game? Maybe, maybe not. 

Maybe it doesn't erase the bad, but don't pretend that the 'bad' in this scenario is at all really that bad.

And 'good deed' doesn't really speak to the volume of time, effort and money that has been put into the various causes that the B&MG foundation supports.

Finally, your continued reference to the Nazis implies you think they've actually done some monumentally good deed that would compare to saving millions through malaria vaccinations and prevention. Is that the case? If so, what is it that they did that you think relates so closely?"
"You need to install the ""concience"" update. It overrides some of the code in the ""short term cost control"" plugin. "
"Watching his interviews and conversations he's had with people leads me to believe that he is just this nice, or at least, very close to it. He always comes off as a genuine person. Has a sense of humor, is intelligent, empathetic, not just ""Let me put on my CEO face for this interview and be stern but confident.""

But for something like this, you also have to factor in that despite him seeming like a very genuine and nice guy, he also has buttloads of money and he could put pocket change (relative to him) in to displace any financial losses this would potentially bring."
"Based on what I've heard from people close to him, Elon isn't particularly empathetic to people directly, but he's obsessively empathetic to people/humanity."

That said, they might pay it. I'm getting quite a few downvotes from people who I assume think I'm arguing that the insurance companies *shouldn't* pay anything they don't absolutely have to, which I'm not. I wouldn't be at all surprised if they did, in a case like this. People don't really understand that they're going above and beyond when they do that, though, because paying for things is what insurance companies do, so it doesn't get a lot of praise like Tesla gets when they do it."
"Plus if you rear end someone, I think you're at fault pretty much automatically (which is basically what happened)."
"The idiots that just didn't notice me usually change the lane as soon as they do, yes. But there are those who take a flasher signal personally and stick to the left lane then more than ever. 

**Intentionally** blocking the left lane however is **coercion** and as such a punishable offence. That's something many people don't understand or don't know. It's not only tailgating (which I don't do because I know of the risks) that is considered coercion, it's generally forcefully hindering people from doing what they like. The only legal way to stop someone from doing something illegal is by detaining them and calling the police. Every other way like intentionally blocking the left lane, braking other drivers or like for example blocking them from leaving a car park because they parked in your space **is coercion** and as such punishable.

Actually the university isn't getting *paid* so much as just getting whatever money it needs to do the job it does. Like any other government agency. Because it is one.

University notices that it now has 15,000 students and only had 10,000 five years ago? And projects that number to stay the same for the next like 10-30 years? Needs more building? More staff?

"My Ford and Toyota dealers both did this when we bought our cars a few years ago, and from what I understand is pretty common.  They make a best guess for tax/registration if you purchase after business hours and if you overpaid you get a check in the mail a few weeks later."
Can we start crediting the people who actually found this error and fixed the mistake rather than Elon? He's inspiring and incredibly hard working but he doesn't run the company single handedly.
"This is actually routine.  Lots of types of transactions guess at a future cost and credit you the difference. When you get a mortgage, they guess at various fees and taxes in the future. Buying a car is the same way. They just simply guess at future fees and then settle with you later.

When I got my Fiat, this went the other direction.  I got a letter a few months later asking for more money because they had to pay ""higher than expected"" DMV fees. 

If you look closely at the purchase agreement, this reality is written down.
"
"Every dealer does this. You pay a little extra for license/registration fees and they refund the excess to you. Happened on every car I've ever bought, including used ones, including from sketchy discount used car lots. Usually it's something like $40-$150."
"Top posts right now are a standard refund of overpaid taxes and a photo album of old Model 3 pics. Please Tesla, please give us something to talk about!"
Great now the books are gonna be off for the earnings report...
The fact this standard practice is front page material should be embarrassing
Seriously? Any serious company would do this. Why are you surprised Tesla did?
"From the comments here it appears this is pretty common, but I've never had this happen. In my state the reg fees are fixed and the sales tax is a percentage of purchase price. Is this not the case elsewhere?"
"Companies are required by law to do this.  It's unclaimed property technically.  You can check your coresponding states website to see if you have any unclaimed property in your name.  This can take many forms like previous overpaid bills, positive old bank account credits, tax credits for businesses, unpaid or unclaimed wages from previous employers etc.  "
"Elon didn't do this. Tesla is required by law to do this, just like any other dealership. Shit post. "
"My favorite business lesson that I have learned came from my father:  If you do what's right for your client/customer, the money will take care of itself.  "

It's the law. Thank you Tesla for obeying laws so that you won't have to pay major fines and court fees.

"This is common practice among all dealerships, regardless of the manufacturer. They have no way of really telling you the exact amount of taxes, so they simply guess based on their best estimate.

The only time this doesn't happen is if you live in a state with no sales tax, which are New Hampshire, Oregon, Delaware, Montana and Alaska. Also of note, if you go buy a car from a state that has no sales tax, they will also add an estimated sales tax on their which will be payable to your state of residence, typically based off of your zip code."
Yeah my mom got 2.58$ back from mini. I'm 99% sure any reputable dealer ship would do the same
I'm dreading when they send me a note that says the opposite :(
This is normal. Stop sucking Elon off so much it's clogging your brain up with jizz.
"When I ordered my car you had to pay for the back parcel shelf for $250. A few months after I got my car they made it included as part of the car.

Without me asking Tesla sent me a check randomly for the $250+ taxes (total something like $278). The check didn't come with a letter or call, so I literally had to call Tesla myself to see why it was sent.

Side note: parcel shelf is included now (allegedly, heard from someone) because without it there is more noise in the cabin from the back wheels."
I got the same letter and a check for $350!
I was hoping you would post a pic of the car too!
"This is how you avoid a class action lawsuit.

Aka the accounting department made people send out checks to match their adjusting entries. No accountant wants to deal with finding why debits > credits 
"I just had an opposite experience. I earned a $1,000 referral credit. Genuinely didn't know it expired on December 31st of last year. The original email doesn't have an expiration or a link to more details. I happened to notice it for the first time on January 3rd (because a friend told me he used my referral code and check if it applied... my second referral). I immediately contacted Tesla. Was told HQ says it was on your MyTesla page and should've known. Out of luck. You lost $1,000. Seriously, that's your first reaction to someone who helped you sell a car? (And, if you search, you'll see a bunch of people didn't know the credit expired.) You'd think they'd send out an email saying ""Hey, you have a credit expiring."" Overall, disappointed in how it was handled. Seems to me like they were banking on people not knowing as there's no dispute the credit was earned. No benefit of the doubt for a huge Tesla advocate helping you sell cars?"
Why thank Elon?
"Both Tesla and Elon Musk deserve praise for the things they've done but this particular case is neither unheard of nor did Musk himself spot the mistake and decide to send you a refund.

"I don't mean to be a buzzkill but I remember doing this when I worked at a Chevy dealership, especially if a payoff for a trade-in is involved. It's a lot easier to send a check to your customer because you went over on what they paid than have to call them up and ask for more money"
Any car dealer will do this. Sales tax and reg fees go to the govt and not the dealer. If they were found to have kept an excess it would be a PR/legal shitstorm for them...

"That's true, but he does set a corporate culture. I've worked for a company that has transitioned from a visionary, inspirational leader like Elon to a more traditional, numbers-oriented, managerial CEO, and there's been a profound change in the company's culture."
"I work for Tesla and honestly doubt that Elon knows this is happening to begin with. In Elon's world, no errors should have been made in the first place negating the need for refund checks. The operations teams are what keep the Tesla engine moving. Also, I am unsure if we are allowed to legally keep fee overcharges being a publicly traded company. Our auditors wouldn't like that. "
"C'mon guys. You cannot collect excess sales tax. You can get in fuckloads of trouble. It's cool they wrote a great letter, but make no mistake they absolutely had to issue the refund unless they want an investigation by the state's attorney general where this was sold in."
"Yes and no.  He didn't do the leg work,  but he does lead and form  the culture of the company.   Most other CEOs would hold profit over service. "

"For future reference, if you get a letter asking for more money because the DMV estimate was short, you owe them $0. The car is in your name and the contracts were signed. The dealer can eat shit. I worked for a dealership, and sent out quite a few of the letters asking for money myself because my boss told me to, but the customer could ignore it and have no repercussions. It was also my job to get the DMV estimates right in the first place, which wasn't always an exact science :/"

"Yes, accounting wise with inventory and the way parts and labor are accounted for in large items like cars, when money comes from thin air and you have a record of that happening, it's bad for the company and even worse if you try to hid it from tax and other financial auditors like your creditors. I failed or nearly failed my corporate accounting class, but I think that's what happens at large companies who have all these accounting obligations. They basically aim to not have these weird line items in their accounting records so that they can more easily get loans and pay debts and taxes. You can't really use that money that comes from accounting errors for anything. It just sits there accumulating blame and it you certainly can't put it in someone's pay check or use it in anyway. "

"Yeah this definitely happened to me with a used Mitsubishi that I bought at an out of state Hyundai dealer.  My fuck up was I didn't  realize I am not liable for Georgia sales tax on a car purchased there when I lived in NC. Since Georgia does not have property tax on cars and gets higher taxes up front.  They refunded me the difference between Georgia sales tax and NC highway use tax.  

I am sure that 4.5% was not something they wanted to remit to me, but they didn't have a choice.  When they go to pay the tax man his share that shit wouldn't add up otherwise.  "

I would argue that a CEO is a person holding a position. A leader is someone providing vision and holding the company to its ideals. The leader doesn't have to be the CEO as long as they are granted the power to run the company.
"You should have just stuck with ""ok"" and not edited in the rest.


I never claimed he personally designed batteries. I don't care about that issue. 

As for your claims about how he could have made a mass market car that blah blah blah... this is where you are really showing your ignorance. Their business model was to make a high end compelling car as a means of funding the further stages of the business. Building a mass market car, certainly without generating the brand buzz as they did with their first cars, as well as building t he engineering expertise, would have been impossible. This is a very well thought out approach to both building a brand, but especially in being a startup car company using cutting edge technology. You're comments that they could have just made a mass market car with less issues is so woefully sophomoric it's almost funny. 
Musk is clearly a genius business man, and his work in building Tesla as a company to this point is really remarkable. Like I said, your comments don't hurt Musk, they just show how little you know on this subject. 

But one thing you said is true... he is far from perfect. No one was claiming he is perfect. Your criticism on tesla are just way off. "
There is some research coming out to support this as well. 
"The thing that kills me about it is that I LOVE data driven decision making...but it needs to drive DECISIONS. SS is just a formula that produces the decision for you. 

There is no leadership in that and it leads to creative stagnation. Businesses need creativity and creativity leads to good business."
"Jobs, Gates, and Musk are/were all CEOs. It's literally the CEO's job to provide vision and hold a company to its ideals. It's not that companies need ""leaders, not CEOs,"" it's that companies just need good CEOs. Nothing special about modern companies. "
Never said he shouldn't make high end cars.  He could have taken out a lot of stuff though he overdid it and a bunch of People died because he didn't test them properly.  Like 3 people.  Nobody talks about that.
I guess my point is that being a CEO doesn't make you a leader. One of the traits of a good CEO is to be a leader. 
"OK. Nobody talks about it because it is malarkey. Those people died because they used their cars contrary to guidance. In the US, 30k+ died in cars from other manufactures in 2016. Why aren't we talking about that? Why aren't they doing more to work toward preventing those deaths, like Tesla is??

"That makes sense. Thanks for the clarification. I guess my point is that is the case for any company, not just modern ones. I think we're pretty much saying the same thing different ways."
By definition you're a leader as CEO. Leader does not have connotation. There are good leaders and bad leaders. Obviously you want good leaders.
