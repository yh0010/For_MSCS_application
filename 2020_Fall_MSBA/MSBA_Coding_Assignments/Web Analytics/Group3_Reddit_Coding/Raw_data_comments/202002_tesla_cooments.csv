This is actually a lot bigger than I thought.
Just me or the front tire looks way bigger than the back tire?
"Damn this is the best I've seen it look so far. I really like it from this angle / in this config / with those colors - dunno what it is but this photo made it ""click"" for me."
Math.
"[Link to original tweet.](https://twitter.com/jayzilla711/status/1233654426545508352?s=21) 

Person in photo said they are 5‚Äô7‚Äù by the way. Those are the 20‚Äù induction wheels."
"Damn it, I should have gotten the Y instead of my model 3. It would be perfect for my family of 4 + dog.

Still love my 3, but could do with a bit of extra height and space in the cabin :-)"
That‚Äôs a sexY ride.
Really love that spec
[removed]
"This actually looks better than I thought so far of the model y, got confused by a model 3 a few days ago, think it might have been a model y aswell, but they shouldn't be here in Europe so probably just a 3 (saw if from an odd angle so it looked taller)"
[removed]
Bummed you cant order those wheels with the performance model
Model Y is really nice. Much bigger and roomier than model 3 . I may switch to model y in 3-4 years.
"Whenever I see a model Y, I think to myself, ""I should trade in my model 3 and upgrade,"" but then I remember I am single so i don't need that much space. Plus I have FSD in my model 3. no reason for me to upgrade."
Dammit. I thought my 3 would suffice.  But this looks hawt.
Gonna be honest Model Y is probably my favorite model.
It's like a new gen Model X without falcon doors. This is gonna sell four times better than model 3.
Best color IMO
The black plastic cladding along the base and wheel well will help prevent paint wear from tire spray/rocks. I wish my incoming 3 had that!
"Awwww I love this too! Fangirling here, haha. I might need to replace my 3 (due to someone slamming into me on the freeway). Been going back and forth on this or a used S."
"Given all the ""it's just a slightly bigger Model 3"" sentiment, I think it looks sick, to mirror the words of my 13yo. The proportions, the wheels... Wow."
"FINALLY, that's the perfect model I was waiting for."
Those wheels are nicer than I originally thought
Can you please stand next to a Model 3 in the same position as the Y? This picture makes the Model Y looks like a X but hard to judge because I don‚Äôt know your height.
"Feeling like these specs are similar to the old Mazda 7 (Now Mazda 5). 

That‚Äôs going to be wonderful!"
Love it!
Do we know if the inductions can fit on an S or 3? I know S and 3 have different bolt patterns...what about Y?
Holy shit its way way bigger than I thought!
Are the rear windows tinted?
"If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, how tall are you?"
"I hope the 3rd row is rear facing and can fit an adult in a pinch.  Looking at this picture I just don‚Äôt see anyway there is a viable 3rd row that can fit a full size person.  I‚Äôm 6‚Äô and while not the most comfortable, I easily fit in my wife‚Äôs highlanders 3rd row.   I just don‚Äôt see how I could ever fit behind the 2nd row in this car.  I don‚Äôt plan on sitting there but my 9 year old is over 5‚Äô tall and still growing."
Dammit! I might have to sell my 3 now.
Wow that‚Äôs pretty big
It‚Äôs so beautiful
"Best selling car of 2021, 2022, 2023, etc right here"
"Roadster 2: Small sleek design. Looks fast just sitting there

Yes! This is what I‚Äôve been waiting for. You thank so much.
Turns out the guy is 7 feet tall
Those rims are sick.
How much are those tires?
"I saw one on Hwy 101 northbound through Petaluma, CA  (a white one).  This one is the color I love.  Are the front and back wheels a different size?"
"Probably not, but is there a chance the 3rd row is lowered? Like maybe they take some of the trunk space out to gain some room since the hatchback slopes down?  That being said, it's still hard to imagine."
One in a million girls
So exciting üòç
Will the Y come in the same versions as the 3. So a SR+ and a LR AWD then performance?
"Hate those plastic fenders. Looks cheap to me.

If you‚Äôre going to have those mud flaps should be attached standard."
Im still curious to see the rear seats in the very back.
"Love black wheels with blue cars, clicks together so well."
Cybertruck somehow eclipsed it
"Model X is 66"" high  so no the Model Y is not an inch taller."
So about the height of a Nissan Leaf. Excellent!

so long?
"Huh, guys, this is clearly photoshoped! Not only the front tire looks much larger, you can see the smudge near the front mudflap!"
[deleted]
"Apparently the guy is only 5'7"""
I know it sounds crazy but I have noticed this in other pictures. Might be an optical illusion related to the shape of the body of the car???
Haha for sure. Gotta be a distorted pic or something.
"I think it has to do with the body distance between the tire and roof on the rear tire.

My Mazda 3 sedan had a similar thing.

[https://i.imgur.com/1Mg0y7g.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/1Mg0y7g.jpg)"
"tyre‚Äôs turned to the left by about 2-3 degrees, camera angle therefore makes type look bigger than it is"
All to do with lighting/shadows. üëçüèº
Definitely an optical illusion. Look at amateur photos (particularly on Craigslist) of motorcycles most notably taken from the right rear looking towards the bike. Without fail the rear tire looks insanely huge compared to the front.
"You're not crazy. It definitely looks that way. However, I've seen enough optical illusions with similar circles that appear to be different in size to know that's most likely what's going on here."
Came here looking for this comment.
what the?!
[deleted]
"With the person in the photo for scale, the proportions finally make sense!  It felt so ‚Äúprius‚Äù in some of the other shots I‚Äôve seen, but here, suddenly I have a better idea of what it looks like in the flesh, and I love it"
"So it‚Äôs bigger than I thought, awesome"
5 feet 7 inches = 1.7018 meters
Is induction wheels the way to go? I ordered a Y but not sure on which one to get
Use proper units. USA doesn't own this place.
Maybe u can trade it in for a Model Y?
That's actually a S3XY ride
[removed]
It looks meaner and less like a Prius. I like this angle.
I don't know what's wrong with me but I can't tell the difference between a model x and y.
[removed]
"yeah, what the hell gives with that?"
"I had no plans to upgrade from my 3 before.  Now, with the increase in range, and the bigger size than I expected, I‚Äôll probably get one as soon as my 3 is paid off.  Maybe sooner"
"The only vehicle for which I'd even consider trading my model 3.
I'll probably stick with my 3 though."
"The 3 looks proportional, this looks a little strange from front and back. Looks like an X from side though"
Get both :)
Height it 5‚Äô7‚Äù
Not me in the photo but he did say he was 5‚Äô7‚Äù
It definitely won't be rear facing.
"I‚Äôve been dying for a rear-facing 3rd row.  It‚Äôs useless forward facing but if it‚Äôs rear facing with feet dropping into the rear sub-floor cubby area there would be room for full size adult heads and feet!  Please Elon, freakin PLEASE.  Been hoping that was why they didn‚Äôt want to really show it, because they had a surprise in store (and maybe wanted more lead time before any other manufacturers could follow?)"
"Haha, yeah but some of us want to be invisible."
Agreed. I really don‚Äôt like it :(
Drag coefficient would like to have a word with you.
I'm curious as to the height of the gentleman in the image. It might be throwing the size off.
Came here to write exactly this get the F away from my car son
"1. Not his
2. The picture tells more than a random measurement anyways"
"And it STILL looks bigger than I thought.  Last time I saw a photo, it hardly looked any bigger than a hatchback 3 with a 1‚Äù lift..."
Really?
"I‚Äôm a car enthusiast and have never seen or heard of that..ever. Maybe you‚Äôre confused with a wider wheel/tire on the fronts, which is sometimes, but rarely used for front wheel drive biased performance cars (Audi RS3 as an example)."
"What in the fuck is ""bump compliance""?"
5/7 in agreement.
Fuck the metric system.
If the Gemini wheels are the same as the aero wheels from the model 3 then those have better aerodynamics and therefore are better for range. The induction wheels definitely look nicer and are sportier but they‚Äôll affect your range a bit.
Canadian here that enjoys freedom units from time to time.
"reddit's an american website, this is a subreddit for an american car, and a photo taken in america... just google the unit conversions like the rest of us"

"Sure, the 508mm induction wheels.. ;) is that the wheel size used wherever you are?"
Rip

Got it!
"I don't think the model 3 looks like a prius, The design of it has grown on me, and I guess that the model y will as well, but some press photos of the model 3 and y have odd angles, the 3 looks more sporty irl imho, but it's not very agressive, which helps it look better and less than a ""bro-dude"" car and more like a ""tech car"".

&#x200B;

The model 3 design is a bit more reserved, which is what some people dislike, but I think that it looks more like an Apple product in that way, reminds me of 21tst century vw beetle or something type car."
"Eh, all the models look very similar unless you're up in it's business. Not a knock on them, they look great, just hard to quickly differentiate on the fly or when one is flying by you. I still have trouble with the X/Y, m quickest way for me to tell is on the X, the front and rear door handles meet in the middle so it looks like one long handle. On the Y, the handles are located more like a traditional car/like the 3."
"it could have been a model x,  I know that there's a few around here. it's mostly the headlights that are easiest way to identify them, and I think that the X is a bit ""fatter"" or more rounded with the roof and bonnet."
[removed]
"I've decided to trade in my Model 3, which I ended up buying a set of 19"" OEM Performance wheels at a killer price literally 2k miles into ownership. Not sure how well they would fit on the Model Y. Still have brand new 18"" Aeros with less than 2K miles that I could swap back before trading in."
"This is my biggest hesitation right now. When I see it from the side I think, ‚ÄúDamn this looks good!‚Äù But when I see it from the back I‚Äôm like, ‚Äú...Meh‚Äù"
In the future. I do have en electrician coming in a few days to install a 2nd 240V in my garage.
"$3,000 seems pricey for the mini-3rd row, but if it included a power folding step to get into the hatch area it‚Äôs a little more reasonable.  Rear facing is the only way I see enough headroom and foot room.  The only other thing could be a higher roofline on 3rd row versions.  Worse range as a result."
Drag coefficient would imply something here is helping the aerodynamics. There is no change between this and what the body would continually be if it were all one piece like every other model. Now if the bottom folded in to reduce drag sure. We can set up time to talk. This is just a cost save.
"In another comment, someone said 5'7""."
It's owned by Tesla and they love this kind of marketing
"Yes.  Lighting can play mega tricks in photos 

If the camera is slightly closer to the front of the car, the angle can play tricks too.  Lots of possible reasons"

Ok cool thanks
Your 27¬∞ day is much nicer than my 27¬∞ day!
I like you. You seem like a flexible and accepting individual. You really measure up to your peers.
"As an American I really wish we had switched to metric in the '70s and '80s like Canada did (or earlier!).  Our current system is a mess.  How many liters in a quart?  My 1/4"" wrench doesn't work better find a 6mm!  How many feet in a mile?  How many kilometers in a mile?  Bleh!"

Would mean taking a huge loss on your 3.  But would also mean you have the Y you want

The model 3 is if you made a car that looks like what vanilla tastes like. It‚Äôs not an ugly car it is just sooooo plain.
That‚Äôs probably the best giveaway right there.  Handles
Easiest is to check the door handles. Y has the same handles as the 3.
[removed]
Nice! I‚Äôm trading in my brand new 3 (that was recently involved in an accident and being repaired. TL;DR I rear ended a vehicle that stoped in the middle of an intersection for emergency vehicle that was a good bit away.) after it get repaired for a performance Y. I can‚Äôt wait for it!
How does that change the fact that he‚Äôs standing too close?
Ok just asking...
Haha but like our blood neighbour we‚Äôre the same 97¬∞!
"I blame the lack of conversion to metric in the US on industry‚Äôs lack of creating new containers in easy to remember metric sizes. Most Americans understand what a 2 liter bottle of soda is... but how many ml in a can of soda? I‚Äôm not 100% sure, but I think it‚Äôs a weird number like 355ml... basically a 12oz can with ml listed, which is far cheaper than creating a new size can that is 350ml. There are other examples where the opposite is true... a Ford 5.0 is easier to remember than calling it a Ford 302."
"I grew up with metric and now use imperial in aviation. Wonder which way is harder to learn. 

Granted I don't have to give a stuff what a quart or yard is haha"

"I prefer plain infront of too flashy and overstated or too cluttered and busy any day though, but yes, they could have made the performance model look a bit more sporty, or make a ‚Äùfastback/coupe‚Äù with a more flashy look."
"I like how clean it is, and I‚Äôm a BMW guy. Front end gives off Porsche vibes"
"I‚Äôd much rather have ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù or ‚Äúunderstated‚Äù styling with slick aero and form-follows-function than the boy racer crap some automakers are designing these days.  Teslas look much better in person.  It‚Äôs as if they are hand sculpted artwork instead of computer designed 3D modeled only?  Hard to describe the essence that they capture but they are beautiful IMO.

As for many of the other carmakers, I feel like their designs have really lost their way!  Just add some more creases in random places, and slap some fake vents and a wing on an oddly proportioned vehicle and call it ‚Äúsporty‚Äù I guess?  I can‚Äôt follow designs that are overstyled and gimmicky"
"Not if the car is far away and in motion, still think the headlights/front is the easier way."
Right on! Yea I recently had back surgery so I've decided higher ride height may be a good thing hehe. Initially we were looking to keep the 3 and checking out used BMW X3s...man...just dealing with salespersons and dealerships annoyed the hell out of me. And of course driving an ICE car just doesn't do it for me anymore.
As a Tesla shareholder I say he can stand as close as he wants to this car I own a small part of
Is that why Canadians are so hot?
Only thing metric has over murican is decimals vs fractions....fractions are the devil
I'm sorry someone pissed in your coffee.

"Exactly.  Subtle and elegant, like a Porsche.  

Teslas don‚Äôt quite have the stance or proportions because they design/build cars with a lot more function and utility in mind (than a 911 or cayman) but they sure do a great job with proportions for what they are IMO.  Some trade offs for packaging, and for absolute aero too.  But I find them to be gorgeous for what they are"
"Study all the little details and maybe it will become easier?  There are tons of little give always from the hood/bumper and headlights, to the way the character line at the shoulder of the side of the car interacts with the rear fender, to the little ducktail lip spoiler on the trunk lid vs, the spoiler on the X, taillights that point somewhat down on the part that wraps around the side to the fenders vs the 3 taillight set-up that runs higher on the rear fender following the the fender line (triangle turned 90* if that makes sense)

If you want to get better at telling them apart start looking for all the details"
"Man I totally can feel you on that. I‚Äôm a tall guy with a family history of bad knees and joint pain. The 3 is great but after being in my mothers Model X I was 100% sold that I needed a taller car than my 3. As for the car dealership I just helped a friend get a new car, god I was so done with them by the time we got the keys. I told my buddy that he needs to get a Tesla after he starts to make money as a software dev. and is financially capable."
That‚Äôs going to be sold as used or as a demo vehicle in the showroom one day.  As a shareholder you should care about paint fixes. Give the car some space man.  How is the picture enhanced by standing that close?
Why would you be sorry? That is an exotic drink

I think the marketing value outweighs any small scratches
Yeah but it's better when you boof it.

Nvidia and others make computers that power self-driving cars. 

 A few manufacturers can update their infotainment systems over the air.

No other car can receive data and update all powered components of the car over the air. I don't think most of the big auto even understands the significance of OTA and data gathering. Even if they did, they have no path to achieve the level of connectedness and upgradeability of Tesla.

They are in trouble.

I kinda feel bad for Toyota because their hybrid strategy was quite... adequate."
"This is classic click-bait that if the author had done actual market research would find out its complete bull. 

Take for example the computer chip. While in the past the proliferation rate of tech in new car models have been longer.  It is not so today. Take EyeQ4 for example, a very efficient NN processor which has all the NN that are running on today's current Hw2+ and HW3 systems and more since 2017.

It became production ready Q4 2017. By end of 2020 it will probably be in up to 20 car models. Nio an electric startup was the first to put it into series production during the first half of 2018. This is roughly 6 months after its production readiness.

BMW on the other hand put it into series production Q4 2018, that was literally 1 year after production readiness. Its now in almost every new BMW model, starting from that time, also VW models and this year even Ford (mach-e), etc.

So the proliferation in the industry for EyeQ4 was around 2 years.

For EyeQ5 which has even better deep learning compute efficiency than the FSD computer. It will be production ready second half of 2020 and is planned to be put into series production Late 2020 by Lucid just months afterwards. Then BMW will put it on the INEXT the first half of 2021, then VW, etc.

The proliferation into the industry again will be around 2 years. The tech is READY and AVAILABLE, you either put it on your car months after it goes live (nio, lucid) or you slow walk and wait 2 years (ford)"

"Not too many years ago, there were plenty of similar articles about how great a strategy it was to not only have parts suppliers, but outsource the innovation and design to them.  Great idea, but now we see the innovation and design will be limited to those parts, rather than the whole.

Wasn‚Äôt it great to be able to outsource a door, for example, and have someone else worry about making the buttns do various things like windows, locks, mirrors? Yeah, no, now those Doors have a separate control unit that only cares about those buttons, which is a problem for trying to add automated features and OTA updates."

"There is one **HUGE** strategic difference between Mobileye and Tesla, and it's not the chip capability (although everyone is focusing on that).

* Mobileye's systems rely on HD maps (which do not widely exist yet), and they are actively building a platform with VW where fleet cars will need to generate/update those maps.  If they can build this out widely and maintain it effectively, they have a shot.  Otherwise it will only ever work on highways (transport fleets) and urban areas (lots of active mapping).   Many say this solution also requires a 5G cellular connection for map data x-mit.
* Tesla's systems aims to truly ""teach the car to drive"" the way humans can drive without an HD map, by leveraging driver experience data to refine and improve future performance.

Wildly different architectures requiring very different compute solutions. Remains to be seen who will come out on top."

"Toyota is not cutting edge in Canada. They do average, boring, dependable and reliable cars. Lexus is their premium brand name but the internals are all the same parts."
Car industry in general is 7 years behind current tech. So tesla gets it out there in a year.
And this is what disruption looks like. when you check all your assumptions at the door and start from zero.
it's just 6 years? I thought it was 8 years plus because the 2012 model s can do over the air updates and the latest cars from legacy car makers are still unable to do that
"Trust me it's only bc the other companies can afford to get away with it. They can budget their name into the cars price while Tesla's still trying to build trust with their name.

Probably more than a decade than Nissan
"It isn‚Äôt too surprising considering Tesla‚Äôs size (overlapping companies/ventures), production, and focus on the type of cars that they are making. Their singular goal is to produce an advanced car. 

Toyota and VW have to focus on mass global production while also remaining standard and reliable around the world. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if Toyota and VW have similar technology in infant stages but good for Tesla by leading the pack and setting a standard."
"""Automakers worry that computers like Tesla's will render obsolete the parts supply chains they have cultivated over decades, the engineer said.""

Classic disruption theory in practice. The incumbents resist change because it'll render obsolete all the work they've done for decades."
"This compliment given to the computer is one thing. But the real jam in this article is the elimination of third-party suppliers and the streaming of the supply chain. Not many understand the web of interconnections which goes into producing a car today. And these interconnections are so founded and planted, that car companies effectively become victims to them. ""You annoy us, we will cut you off. We cut you off, you have a 6 months delay in your production schedule"". These suppliers behave like unionized workers which can shut you down if you so much as look at them the wrong way. 


Building what is essentially a computer on wheel (obviously Tesla has many dependencies as well), as the article claims, greatly reduces these dependencies. 

What does this mean? That the ability of traditional auto-makers to compete with Tesla is even lower than we thought. They are on a really slippery slope towards their ultimate re-making or death (i don‚Äôt wish it on them, just to make it clear). 

This reminds me very much of the famous innovator‚Äôs dilemma. Big companies sometimes fall because they cannot efficiently re-allocate their resources towards a path that cannibalizes their current cash flow streams. 

Fascinating stuff.

Pardon my grammer/spelling."
"This doesn‚Äôt matter if the car isn‚Äôt reliable and in the 2019 reliability report Tesla comes out last. As an owner I like the car but the fit and finish is not remotely at Toyota, Mercedes, BMW, or Audi level. Neither is de interface which gets more buggy every update. I frequently have to hard reset the car (hold steering wheel select buttons and brake for a couple of seconds)"

"The FSD chip is already outdated tho, if you compare it to Google or NVidia's NPUs. It simply is a 2018 design. That's a lot of time for chip development.


NVidia's current design is much more scalable and outperforms the FSD chip.

NVidia Drive AGX Pegasus - 320 TOPs (dual chip design, [source](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/self-driving-cars/drive-platform/hardware/#))

Tesla is ""ahead"" because they already put the hardware into cars. But it's not used much yet.


The thing is....these NPU systems are all still in their infant state. Development jumps are *huge*. The previous Nvidia generation only did 30 TOPs. Their next generation (""Orin"") aims for up to 2000 TOPs (dual chip design, [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_Drive)).

Tech would move faster if companies could just accept that if they allowed themselves to hire the green mohawk guy who smokes weed at his desk all day they'd have a much more productive and inventive staff.
"yea there's stuff in 2008 performance bmws that you can't even get in cars today like heads up display. Most of Toyota competes on price alone, hence they go with the most basic components to keep price down and reliability up."
Now compare the price of a Toyota and a Tesla. Might explain this whole situation.
The most underappreciated asset of Tesla is it's data gathering. You simply can't build a good FSD system without that data.
The ECU thing was new to me but it totally makes sense. My last car was a MINI and that damn thing vampired my wallet with little controllers here and there dying.
"Interesting, I had discussions to that effect a year ago with some collegues in Finance. Tesla has in fact succesfuly disrupted the industry supply change and is shifting the landscape.

&#x200B;

On top of that, the centralizing of all computing into HW3 makes diagnositics and maintenance MUCH easier than traditional cars. If you ever worked on a car, because most of the parts are supplied through various supplier, it really complicates diagnostics of failures, where as Tesla for the most part has a single point of failure. (I mean that in a good way)"
"Tesla teardown finds electronics in VW and Toyota 6 years behind. 

FTFY"
HW3 central unit looks like something you‚Äôd pull out from a military jet‚Äôs avionics bay than a car. So no wonder someone doing ECUs for everyday Toyotas may be baffled.

How do we know so specifically that this is 6 years ahead? Will Toyota/VW/others want to even follow this method?
"After this article, ARKK has to update its golden goose case to $30000 a share."
I'm actually surprised these legacy shops are only 6 years behind. That's one model cycle and taking into account how these electronics are ordered 5 years ago with reliability not performance and functionality in mind it's not that bad.
I feel this has already been documented a couple of years ago when Sandy Munro did their model 3 teardown and found the electronics to be Military and Avionics grade.  No news here.
Classic example of Clayton Christensen‚Äôs  Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail. Toyota did the same when it first entered the US market in the 70s.
did you really need to tear it apart to find that out?
I have been telling people it's alien technology...
Didn‚Äôt Tesla make all their patents public domain not so long ago?
Alien tech
Elon Musk time traveller confirmed
Ill bet whatever you want that SIX full years from now the electronics in Toyotas are better than these.
"The screen resolution on most new infotainment systems as well as their touch responsiveness is worse than a $30 Amazon Fire tablet and I‚Äôm not even exaggerating. 

Most car buyers are lemmings in that they‚Äôve been shafted with garbage tech and conditioned to 1. Believe this is totally normal and 2. Not ask why car tech lags so far behind consumer tech (another example is the shit maps UI in almost every car before Apple CarPlay and AA arrived. My shit Android phone from 2011 had better maps (Google) than most cars have today)"
"It does not make sense to talk about being 6 years behind another company in terms of technology. They could just hire the people who created it, to be 0 years behind. Besides we have no idea how far any of these companies have come in terms of any technology apart from what they have released. One anonymous Japanese engineer saying ""we cannot do it"" is far from hard evidence that others are struggling."
Why does this sub attract so many fake automotive technology experts?
[deleted]
"There is nothing new in the article. It was announced during autonomy day that Tesla made their own FSD chip. Are they just finding this out ? They didn't need to strip the car.

What Elon said about batteries is more stunning. No other car company is thinking about cells, modules and batteries while Elon and team are going full speed with this. The world needs to pay more attention."
Keep in mind the business model at Tesla is different because they are going for market share not profit. So cost is likely not as big of a factor. They can afford to design in house where other manufacturers likely standardize design and sub it out.
That's not 6 years ahead of Toyota. That's at most 6 months ahead.
"Here's Teslarati's commentary on this teardown by *Nikkei Business Publications*

"I call complete bullshit. I worked as an electronic engineer for a tier 1 supplier and dealt with engineering sample silicon of absolutely cutting edge tech on several occasions. Think Volvo, JLR, Ford, Peugeot."
Well have you seen the reliability of their technology? The reason major companies dont put in technology that advanced is because the bugs arent worked out yet.
"Last I checked, Toyota isn't driven by a computer like Tesla. So wyf would Toyota or anyone else spend money to have a flashy computer on board? This comparison is stupid."

"Too bad any large vehicle company can crush Tesla, and Tesla won't be able to do shit when it happens. When one of the big domestic 3 go in for the kill, they'll destroy Tesla within 2 years. GM's electric truck will probably kill the shitty ugly Tesla cyber truck. Sorry Tesla, you're only around because GM, Ford, and Chrysler/fiat are letting you. Love how I am getting downvoted by spitting the truth. Tesla doesn't have the capital."
They start integration with currently available market tech and then take 5 years to bring it to market. In that regard the lag makes sense.
"It should surprise you.  As a new car company Tesla‚Äôs budget was far, far smaller.  Taking on all this stuff in house rather than relying on suppliers was far more costly.  In fact automotive giants VW and Ford are having to collaborate just to compete with Tesla in Autonomy and electrification."
"Ain't that the truth?  Think about how long Bluetooth was a ""thing"" before vehicles actually started including it as a standard feature... and it STILL lags behind the functionality and ease-of-use available on your phone, laptop, or other Bluetooth-enabled device.

It's one of those common annoyances."
"The legacy automakers could easily be innovating more, they just haven‚Äôt had to and it‚Äôs cheaper not to. Any one of them could have taken the Tesla route with a new model - if the ‚Äúcheeky little startup‚Äù can pull it off then vast empires like VW have absolutely zero excuse. Here‚Äôs hoping those dinosaurs implement some real change (ID.3 screwups isn‚Äôt a promising example) or die out."
"This article isn't about that at all. It's that the FSD computer isn't something that's expected in other cars until 5 years from now, allegedly.

I have 5 year old devices that feel great and responsive. It's not like technology from 5 years ago sucked."
This is the reason I opted out of the center screen and nav on my Toyota. My phone has a lot more capabilities and is more pleasing to look at. Put up a dash mount and presto a modern screen and apps. Even on my Tesla I use the phone more than the screen since it is so limited when it comes to apps/programs. I need Waze Tesla!
Imagine if Tesla added variable 120hz and 240hz touch sampling(like upcoming Samsung S20) with HDR on their screens it'd be the fastest/smoothest screen on any car for a long time before competitors even catch up. Good for watching Netflix in HDR and playing games at high refresh when charging or what not.
PEP36 so it is three years not five.
You mean ‚Äúpalm pilot‚Äù feeling?
"Other automakers get different systems from other manufacturers. That automatically means by the time they chose that system it was already available and a little dated and by the time their new car rolls out with that system it's much older than anything Tesla does.

It's also the reason it's harder for them to add or change features once the cars are out there while you can tweet Elon with some bizarre idea and see it added in a future update. It's not just the OTA updates, it's having full control of all systems on the car and full access to all the software for those systems."
"I've always wondered why they have the ""old phone"" feeling effect, finally have a reason/understanding ty"
"My Model X P100D was built March 2018 but the touchscreen feels archaic. It has MCU1, lags and is slow and has gotten worse with every update. Still no path to upgrade. Pretty poor UI performance for a car that was built under 2 years ago."
"Upvoting for ""old phone."" You nailed it."
It‚Äôs also about the fact that Tesla is innovating in ways that these other manufacturers are clearly not. This isn‚Äôt just about part backlogs.
"Tesla has really opened my eyes to the shenanigans of business as usual in the auto world. Everything is outsourced and then the marketing people dress it up as ""oooo pretty...don't look at the screen, look at this faux carbon fiber plastic ..."". I was pulling out the stereo on a 2014 mercedes and it was made by mitsubishi. I discovered it had GPS integrated into it but was disabled in my trim."
"Thanks, first time I heard of outline and it is awesome. 
Suddenly there are no ""5 simple tricks every doctor hates"""
"The Y is a very conservative product in many ways, but I do believe that they will go ahead with the new wiring system and a heat pump cabin heater (by no means advanced tech). Seems like they know the 3 is an amazing platform and are just adding a few new pieces of tech to the Y on top of the 3."
"As someone who doesn‚Äôt know what that is, would you be able to tell me?"
It doesn't.
He's an alien trying to fund a rocketship to go back home
No. Elon is the time machine itself. He's bringing the future to us all.
So Elon needs to save whales to stop a future probe from draining the oceans on a terraformed mars...seems legit. Who's to say Tesla didn't invent those batteries anyway?
"haha, this is my theory. He comes from the future so he knows what is possible and is just trying to bring it forward by 100 years. 

*he also knows about the climate disaster's end state!"
or he just invested money on R&D and hired people that actually know what they're doing.
"He's going to be the next Howard Hughes, he'll have a space force larger than any country's."
He actually just turns up to work early.
could you imagine telling your leaders at one of the largest businesses in the world that you can‚Äôt advance your tech because ‚Äúit might hurt our suppliers?‚Äù
"Not just BS, a totally lame article. They only call out the self-driving module, after a complete tear down. What else did they find? I hate lazy, click-baity journalism, if you can even call it that."
"Watch Autoline‚Äôs Carmageddon episode.  Two industry analysts with ties to multiple legacy firms confirm it.  Sometimes truth is hard to bear.

Also a VW exec stated that they have 200 different software teams spread across dozens of suppliers working on software for dozens of processors and this all has to be coordinated to just implement OTA updates.

Do you have a better theory why 8 years after Tesla introduced it, no other legacy auto manufacturer has managed to introduce over the air software updates?"
"Yes, completely misleading imo. The industry expert said he expects this kind of tech to be implemented in 5 years. With that he meant the powerful pc inside teslas, HW3. Thing is, it's going to take a few years until this hardware can truly be utilized.

While Tesla is using the silicon Valley approach of using their users as beta testers, VW and Toyota go the old way of polishing the tech until it's ready, and then releasing it, even if that means releasing it later than Tesla."
"Thank you.

The article tries to lead you to believe it's a single computer that replaces every other processor on the car (even as far to directly and wrongly say it controls the media stuff -- it does not).  The whole precedent of the response from other automakers relies on this untruth.

Nothing to see here, just hype."
I thought the same but read the whole thing. I am now dumber.  What a garbage article.
My Lexus was a bit behind other manufacturers in gadgets when I bought it new. 10 years have passed and I've had 0 issues.
Something tells me that the delay on powered seats in the Tacoma is not because they were concerned about the _quality_.
[deleted]
"This would assume that innovation and quality are diametrically opposed.  That would mean that every new iPhone that comes out is extremely low quality, which they're not.

I think you're giving Toyota a pass here - they actively fought integration with CarPlay and Android Auto for years, and it wasn't a quality thing.  Car manufacturers have been coasting for decades on most fronts, especially electronics.  It's not their area of expertise (profiting while minimally improving their product is), and they've never been forced to compete until now."
"To be fair power seats are kinda pointless. ""Oh look this thing I adjust literally one time to where I like it is ELECTRIC"".

Edit. Alright I get it. It's nice for when you share a vehicle. I still stand by that it's largely pointless if you are the only driver primarily. And even if I'm borrowing someone's car the only adjustment I make is forward and back which takes .2 seconds."
"A comment about Mercedes also estimating a 5 year timeframe was posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/f56oaw/tesla_teardown_finds_electronics_6_years_ahead_of/fhwxc20?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).

> Was told the same thing by a Mercedes engineer a few weeks ago. It‚Äôs not about competence or budget (not primarily at least), but about being stuck in decade-old supplier relationships and commitments. He said at the current pace they‚Äôd be able to catch up to Tesla‚Äôs current design in about 5 years.

Also relevant quote from Elon at autonomy day

> I think if somebody started today, and they were really good, they might have something like we've got today in about three years. But in two years, we'll have something three times better.

I don't think Jim Keller is available today - So 3 years would be very optimistic."
"I've read a lot of comments dismissing Tesla's software advantage asserting that such-and-such legacy automaker has a far superior infotainment system. Uh, yeah, we're talking software that runs the *whole* car, buddy, not some fancier in-dash stereo system."
VW launched a network where their cars can communicate with each other and warn if there is an accident or obstacle. Hopefully Tesla will achieve the same thing. Level 4 autonomy they should continue working hard on it and publish their research to help the humanity just like what waymo is doing
"They absolutely do understand they aren‚Äôt stupid lol. You people are ignorant.   
GM and many others have full OTA updates I‚Äôm their newest global architectures.   
I personally don‚Äôt want OTA because I refuse to let the OEM have the power to remotely brick my car at their whim."
As a Tesla owner the system is buggy and not remotely as nice as a similarly priced Mercedes or BMW system. I love the car but they also now are reported to be the least reliable brand last year and in my experience this is true.
There are cars...NIO being one of them. You just haven't done your research.
"I have a 2016 Audi and it‚Äôs a fantastic car, but it really irks me they don‚Äôt do any OTA upgrades like Tesla does. It has a bunch of irrelevant features like internet radio stations that don‚Äôt work."
"Their hybrid strategy was adequate?  It was Toyota's way of seeming environmental while requiring people to still buy an expensive, costly-to-maintain gas engine.  It was a total cop-out.  Even now they're fighting EVs tooth-and-nail.  This is because they refuse to let gas engines and their never-ending profit stream go, to hell with the environment."
"OTA updates have just never occurred to them. Car has left the lot, good bye forever until we find something that might kill you so the government forces us to 'fix it' or whatever.

Why would they want to support their product AFTER they have the money from the customer?"
"> For EyeQ5 which has even better deep learning compute efficiency than the FSD computer.

> Late 2020 by Lucid

> BMW INEXT the first half of 2021

Okay let's compare where Tesla's Autopilot with HW3 is beginning 2021 and these competitors with EyeQ5. It's not that easy to just stick a chip in your car and call it a day.."
"> Does anybody know if it would be feasible to make the HW3.0 FSD processors available for distributed computing (...) where different protein arrangements and their effects on the body (...) are calculated

There are multiple units in the FSD chip. Three major ones are: general purpose processor (CPU), graphics processor (GPU) and neural network (NN) inference processor.

Most people probably thinks about using NN processor, as ""the most powerful"" part of the chip. The NN chip can NOT be used for any other computation than convolution neural networks or similar concepts. Its control logic, instruction set and computation units arrangement allows it to process only neural network convolutions. It would be also possible to perform some simple arithmetics on 96 element vectors, but I doubt it would be worth the effort. So unless you find a way to predict protein behavior with neural networks, than no, you cannot use it for this king of computations.

Remaining parts (CPU and GPU) are like in any other computer, so it can be used for any other type of calculations. It has 12 core, 64bit ARM CPU, and GPU comparable to smart phones, so it can perform some complex computations, but I'm not sure if it would be worth it."
No you can't. Protien folding needs 32bit float processing unit. Tesla's Hardware 3 is optimized for 8bit integer processing. You can't even use multiple 8bit unit to collectively process a 32bit operation because they don't have cache and buffer that allow sharing of intermediate results between processing unit. Process result is written directly into hardware memory so doing a 32bit operation on an 8 bit hardware will blow up your memory access up to 64times. Even SRAM that HW3 is using which is 10X faster than DRAM will not be able to keep up with 64X demand.
"This has been the trend in every industry. For years it was, hone your core competencies and leave the rest up to contractors. But once you get big enough and your core competency is stable you realize it's far more profitable to just own the supply chain."
They have to be pointed in a good direction and they all have to be going the same direction.
In the end I predict Tesla will need lidar to make it happen. Apple is working on producing low cost miniaturized lidar. Apple will leapfrog Tesla if they don‚Äôt come to realize this soon. HD Maps are not the answer for sure.
"This article has nothing to do with other manufacturers being ""behind"", but on some assumption that other manufacturers will have something resembling the FSD computer by 2025.

The FSD computer also has nothing to do with the infotainment features, even though the article says it does."
"i dont know which car you had in 2010 but i highly doubt there was anything like this available and id say their implementation looks pretty good, especially having an extra  screen for controls.

"Lol wut? You are smoking crack and/or never sat in a Taycan. It‚Äôs ok you are poor, just don‚Äôt lie."
Even the speedometer on the Taycan goes at a juddery 3 fps or so. It's pathetic.
Apparently the reason is ‚Äúour suppliers won‚Äôt give us better tech‚Äù.
"Get a high interest savings account. Put $300 a month in there. Keep doing that until you have a big enough down payment to have a $300 a month car loan. By then you'll know you can afford the loan because it won't be a new drain on your budget you are just sending the money somewhere else.

Obviously, adjust $300 to your local currency and your budget.

Also, buying a house is usually recommended prior to buying an expensive car. This isn't always true for every living situation."
dont buy.  in 5 years they will be so much better.  buy tesla stock instead
"the thing is they can not do it because they choose to not do it.

Nobody on the market is able to produce enough electric cars to meet the demand so its not like they can completely abandon the ICE market as this is where their money is and will be for the next decade at least."
"Even if it weren't amazing, it wouldn't entirely matter. They're kinda like the Apple of cars - the hardware/software are so well integrated the end UX is great, even if PCs have technically superior hardware"
"They won‚Äôt be as good.  Their chips will have to be more general purpose, because they will serve multiple customers.  Tesla‚Äôs chip is optimized exactly for their exact use case (sensor suite, power budget, instruction set choice...)"
They all already do (except Qualcomm)
"I partially agree here. I‚Äôve been a die hard Tesla fan for years now and LOVE my model 3 but the build quality has to get better. Albeit it is now between my 31xxx vin and my fianc√©‚Äôs 483xxx but still major room for improvement. As for the infotainment system, though it does have quirks is light years above everything else. No other car I have ever been in feels as intuitive. Everything else feels.... dated."
"I read that as advising that Ford and GM use more modules in their cars. In fact, the whole article seems to be mostly BS. My feeling is that Tesla succeeds because they start by trying to make the ***best*** product they can in a particular space, *then* figure out how to make it cheaply. Most everyone else starts out by looking to cut costs in the near term."
"This article seems to throw different subject into one article, mixes it and throws a strange headline that has very little to do with the article on top of it.  
I wouldn't call that a brilliant article."
It's more than just specs on a piece of paper. FSD was designed for one specific application where the final purpose is already known. You know what data is being put into the neural net and you know what outputs to expect. NVidia's processor is closer to a general purpose computer. It won't be nearly as efficient on a per operation basis.
"NVIDIA Drive AGX Pegasus is based on the Xavier processor, which is really 2015/2016 design if you want to count it that way, which is very strange. The DLAs on that chip is rated at combined peak \~30 DLTOPS (INT8). In comparison, Tesla's Hardware 3.0 has dual 36.8 TOPS DLA's, which means 73.6 DLTOPS (INT8).

NVIDIA Orin isn't expected until 2022 at best, and the DLAs are expected to be around 200 TOPS.

But there's more than rated peak DLTOPS. Tesla has a very specific understanding of their software and how best to accelerate it. Stalls, memory access, latency, cache design, and DL multitasking are all very important aspects for performance. NVIDIA's is a generic kitchen sink approach, as they must for a wider variety of clientele. Tesla's chip only needs to accelerate Tesla's software. Which means real world performance on Tesla's software is dramatically better than the rated DLTOPS performance implies. For example, the latency after a flush to generate first results is really important for a real time application. Tesla's hardware is designed specifically for this and is much better than Xavier in that aspect. That doesn't show up in DLTOPS ratings.

Furthermore, getting the software and hardware deployed into the field in the hundreds of thousands builds a tremendous lead. The amount of interesting miles, and very specifically, the ability for their teams to identify issues, collect relevant data, and test them has a dramatically tighter loop than anyone else at dramatically less cost.

You seem to barely grasp any of this."
"No, they designed this chip to be energy efficient, and cost effective, look at the cost of nvidias chip and energy usage, not an apples to apple comparison, furthermore, I‚Äôm sure they will design increasingly better chips, every couple years to keep up."
"The NVIDIA chip consumes a lot more power, and is probably more expensive. Not really compared to the HW3 chip. Tesla still wins from a performance/watt standpoint."
"watch autonomy day, elon already says they are halfway working on HW4 and by the time these chips for NVidia gets to other automakers, tesla will then overtake it with HW4.  and so on and son on, hence the 6 years ahead, etc etc"
2000TOPS at how much energy burn?   RIP range
"> ""One stunned engineer from a major Japanese automaker examined the HW3 computer and declared 'We cannot do it'""

Right, because the buy chips from Renesas, a dedicated semiconductor manufacturer with about 20,000 employees, instead of trying to take on everything in house."
"They dont have to do it.  They can buy it.  (NVidia, Intel)

With that said, those companies will have powerful competitive offerings but can never offer the same level of integration with the car's ""other"" systems outside of autonomy unless they begin to design those hardware platforms as a main component in a full EV suite/architecture  (perhaps partner with Sony?)"
"Lexus IS 300 starts at 38.5k, goes to 48.8k https://www.lexus.com/models/IS - the Toyota brands don‚Äôt have a sports sedan to compare to any more

So not really much of a difference"
"""You simply can't build a good FSD system without that data.""

Where is the $7k vaporware people paid for?  Lol"
"I assure you Tesla vehicles are in the same boat. This article falsely paints a picture of the FSD computer being one central unit for everything (going as far to directly state it is in charge of the infotainment -- it is not) which is not in any way true of a Tesla vehicle. There are still many independent modules talking to each other, just like any other car."
">where as Tesla for the most part has a single point of failure. (I mean that in a good way)

nice that you mention that because thats also the biggest downside, you got a single point of failure build right in and if anything there fails it means full replacement instead of being able to swap individual parts."
"The idea of centralization that this article implies is false. Their one example (the FSD computer being in charge of infotainment) is wrong. Tesla vehicles still have multiple modules that communicate with each other, just like any other car. Please don't be misled by the article.

As someone who has worked on cars, the fact there are multiple suppliers has had zero impact on anyone's ability to diagnose something beyond reaching for the wrong socket set (metric vs. standard etc.)"
"that‚Äòs not how technology works. even if you have access to the new tech, you can‚Äòt just integrate central components. you need to rebuild your whole stack."
"> One anonymous Japanese engineer saying ""we cannot do it"" is far from hard evidence that others are struggling.

While one engineer doesn't set the absolute case, I'd say the WEALTH of evidence in the form of 2020 ""modern"" cars all feeling like a Fisher Price toy from 1994 indicates some problem."
"Yes, it does not take the same time to catch up as it takes to make it in the first place as no company lives in a vacuum.  
  
But then again - as others are catching up, Tesla will keep improving their software and electronic. As Tesla keeps growing it will be harder to catch up until self-driving is a thing and the focus switches to consolidation and standardization across brand.  
Guess Tesla can make a lot of money by licensing their self-driving-tech if they are first at the goalpost."
"Since we have multiple statements from industry analysts and execs of legacy automakers stating very similar facts, I believe they know more than you as to how difficult it will be for them."
"The fact he says a sensible thing now and then makes me think of the ""[monkey in a room for an eternity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem)"" theory rather than ""oh, he said a good thing, maybe he isn't so bad""."

"> regardless what you think of him

In case of compliments, context is very important.

Getting a compliment from Gandhi or Hitler is not equally impressive, nor even equally good."
">No other car company is thinking about cells, modules and batteries while Elon and team are going full speed with this

how do you think anyone is releasing EV¬¥s without thinking about these things?"
"I don't read this as saying that Tesla is six years ahead on the tech, I read it as saying that it would take Toyota six years to redo from the ground up how the different components are integrated with each other, which is holding back rapid innovation.

Teslas superbottle, their shared cooling circuit for battery, motor and HVAC, the move from a point-to-point cable harness to a switched harness, the stainless steel exoskeleton, the switch to consumer grade touchscreens, their OTA updates of nearly any software component in the car, the list of ways in which Tesla has rethought how to build cars is pretty impressive for such a young company.

The corporate model of having hundreds of extremely specialized suppliers that supply the same tiny component to almost all car manufacturers in the world has been completely vital to the enormous cost cutting that has happened in modern automobiles. But we are currently entering a phase in the product life cycle for automobiles where the amount of room for innovation has gone up tremendously, and Tesla is leveraging the hell out of their competitive advantages.

BTW, I'm not saying there isn't lots of innovation coming out of big Auto. Just look at how much better transmissions are today compared to ten years ago! That said, consider the CVT: If Tesla was an ICEV manufacturer, they would have figured out how to pair a CVT with an engine that was optimized for only one exact RPM, and gotten a much more efficient vehicle out of that type of transmission. There were attempts to do just that, but successfully doing so requires rethinking the engine, the transmission and all their support systems including a half-dozen ECUs as a whole, and that's just not going to happen when ever single component comes from a different supplier."
So can you name any other car with this much computing power?
"Why do you think so? The ID3 seems like a great car, a solid improvement on it's predecessor, the e-Golf. But I don't think it's a leap ahead of the Renault Zoe or the Peugot e-208, more like yet another contender in a well served market segment."
"As soon as they manually load software onto 10,000 units, right?  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Not trying to be rude, I actually love the look and hope the ID.3 succeeds, but if you‚Äôre going to throw shade you open yourself up to legitimate criticism"
What‚Äôs that?
You ok?
"Still a poor excuse, the Model S is approaching 8 years now and still has a better screen than most."
"If this comment is true, then the legacy companies would get their hands on HW3-like this year but those cars won‚Äôt come out until 2025. Do you really think they have HW3-like tech this year?"
*and* they go with the cheapest piece of junk they can get away with.
Currently the work around is Apple CarPlay or the android alt.
"I mean, if you use something like ARM, you really don't need to do much to validate from one to the next."
Yeah it just shows the kind of stagnant dinosaurs all these old automakers are
"That's the difference between using a waterfall design approach vs agile...
We're transitioning to Agile in my company. I'm really excited about the future!"
"Yeah if we‚Äôre saying a vast empire like VW ‚Äúreally wants to‚Äù come out with new tech but can‚Äôt manage it, that‚Äôs a crazy level of corporate disfunction, they deserve to go bust. More likely is they keep reaping in maximum profit pushing the old crap until they‚Äôre forced to change."
"I would question the more costly part.  Having to sign fewer supply contracts or deal with vendor quality issues, tighter integration, being able to rapidly resolve problems and make adjustment to subcomponents, being to upgrade components on their schedule; there seems like many areas that in the end they end up saving money."
To be fair both Bl√•tand and wifi in my 2019 sucks. Not even AC or planned WIFI 6 - 6 being a very critical step where everyone has to have complete setup for 6 or loose a lot of performance. I have to buy an extra WiFi AP for our Garage just for the car.

"Legacy automakers are Dinosaurs they are unwilling to change from fossil fuels, they‚Äôre ‚Äúnew‚Äù technology is almost a decade behind the current leading competitor (Tesla) and they still spend hundreds of millions on advertisements of couples having sex off screen and families being created so they can sell their huge gas guzzling family cars to families and lonely men and women who believe buying the car will help find them love. The more commercials a product has the worse it is that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a million Legacy automaker advertisements every second on TV yet there has never been one Tesla commercial because he doesn‚Äôt need to sell a product that already sells itself due to the extreme quality and a passion for one day seeing a truly green earth Elon and his gang

"Have you ever worked high up in a large company? I have. There are tons of excuses. Mostly there‚Äôs no mandate from the share owners. Large institutional investors invest in VW by looking at their balance sheets, margins and forecasts. They don‚Äôt want their stable portfolio to suddenly be a risky venture capital fund. If they want high risk/high reward, they‚Äôll buy e.g Tesla stocks instead. Investors moved their money to modern camera manufacturers long before Kodak went bankrupt."
"careful with that blasphemy! When you're as old as I am you have weathered decades of ""you must buy iteration x!"" ""you need 1 GB, no 2, no 8, no 16 GB of RAM!"".

"Toyota waited obscenely long to implement Android Auto.

Aside from the annoyance of having to plug in the phone, Car Play / Android Auto have been a game changer for built in infotainment. It's a much bigger screen, it's more responsive, it's better optimized for using one-handed, it completely blows away the built in navigation of ~2005 thru 2015. 

IMO it's really levelled the playing field between brands that have good infotainment and brands that have bad infotainment."
Or Android Auto!
honestly the model 3 screen already feels amazing to use.
"> it'd be the fastest/smoothest screen on any car

It already is. Also the biggest"
"HDR would only be a benefit if the screen also had the ability to get substantially brighter (HDR on a dim screen can look worse than SDR), which would also be a benefit to drowning out direct sunlight."
"I'm hoping that the Model Y screen is 4k/120 Hz. Same exact size as the Model 3, but much better screen. Keep pushing forward!"
"Related: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOvQCPLkPt4

120 or even 240 fps is awesome and should be standard everywhere."
"Cool idea but unfortunately it‚Äôs a pointless cost driver. At least 90 percent of the time it would only be displaying semi static information or a nav display/music etc, so 60hz with good touch response and a good GPU driving it for smooth performance (as the model 3 has now) is more than enough.

Truly adding HDR in requires OLED (at the current time), which only benefits viewing Netflix in any real way, and would be just a massive cost increase. The biggest benefit to OLED would be perfect blacks in the dark, but the added cost and potential burn in makes it extremely unlikely."
Too much heat at those sampling rates
"120hz sampling? Sounds like a complete and total waste of tech. That barely makes any sense on a phone, which you're touching all the damn time when it's in use. Putting it on a car screen, which gets touched like twice per drive, if that, would be a complete waste."
‚ÄúYou can do THIS at casinos and THEY CANT STOP YOU‚Äù

What are the other pieces?
"Basically, it goes from 1500m of wiring in the model 3 to 100m in the Y, and they will use a bus like you see on a motherboard rather than a wiring loom like we usually see, so it‚Äôll be easier to automate the wiring installation."

"There was a recent Lex Fridman w Jim Keller (https://youtu.be/Nb2tebYAaOA)

"Actually Toyota has an incredible relationship with their suppliers

Toyota sends Toyota Production System experts to its supplier network to help them become more efficient and safer

https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-toyota-group-and-the-aisin-fire/

The idea is all ships rise together."
"It's very prevalent in Japan espicially among all the large businesses.  It's called ""keiretsu"".  actually Gohn is famous for destroying and getting rid of the keiretsu at Nissan which actually allowed it to be profitable."
"Yeah hilarious. Something is messed up, or more likely they‚Äôre all happy making a pretty penny churning out old tech without any nasty, disruptive innovation. 

The automakers are the *customers* of the suppliers. As a customer you tell your supplier what you want based on your vision and you go elsewhere or just build it yourself if they can‚Äôt provide it. To have suppliers telling the automakers what they can and can‚Äôt have is a joke."
They have the problem with their dealers.  Why wouldn‚Äôt they have the problem with suppliers?
Because dealers want to make money.
"the one main reason why other manufacturers didnt do it is simply because they dont have 4G build into their cars unless its higher class.

Beside this they have established Mechanic networks where they can just install updates whenever a car comes in for service and most importantly they simply had no need for OTA, if you car comes feature complete as advertised out the factory you dont need to patch it unless there is a bug somewhere.

Tesla never had the option to not do OTA because the FSD Alpha version that is on all these cars needs to be patched constantly to improve things."
"Yep. Disfunction on a vast scale which explains why as consumers we aren‚Äôt getting more innovation and better value. We‚Äôve all been taken for a ride. 

The only solution for VW to really succeed in innovative automotive tech is to finance a startup - their own or something like Tesla. Imagine if they swallowed their pride and really went all-in."
"> Do you have a better theory why 8 years after Tesla introduced it, no other legacy auto manufacturer has managed to introduce over the air software updates?

They have and when they don't it's not an issue of capability.

My Mustang got OTA updates Via WIFI when I owned it. Many other cars are doing something similar nowadays. But you'll notice that most of this is limited to infotainment stuff. In many areas dealership laws and agreements straight up prevent OEMs from doing OTA updates to anything outside of infotainment."
"Because they have. A lot of cars released in last 5 years have over the air software updates. Even if users do not really ask for it at all. People are used to bringing the car ir for regular service check once or twice a year and all software gets reflashed and tested then. If something fails in brake software update with OTA - wither you have bad software in your brakes or you are stranded on the side of the road. If same happens in service, they can recover easily on the spot."
"Easy. Because they sell cars with the software already written, not incomplete. So it would only introduce a massive security vulnerability for no good reason."
"When Tesla first rolled out OTA updates it was extremely insecure and vulnerable to attack. They get by security through obscurity. 
They might have fixed it now but there was an insider post on Reddit years ago explaining how janky their software systems were.  
Toyota can‚Äôt just hack something shitty together when they make millions and millions of cars.  
They have standards and care about liability."
"Absolutely. 

From what I understand the European car makers are quicker to implement new tech (with varying degrees of success) whereas Toyota have long been known for the iterative approach."
Precisely
But they also couldn't fix an issue easily after you get the car... unlike Tesla.
"As someone with a degree in industrial engineering who has studied the Toyota Production System in detail, yes it is. Every component needlessly made electronic just creates another failure mode. Minimize failure modes = maximize quality."
"Power seating enables things like driver profiles and easy entry / exit, both things that I use on a daily basis. I like to sit close to the wheel when i drive and having an easy exit profile makes things much easier. Entry / exit is especially helpful for elderly people / people that lack the mobility as the average person."
"the powered seats actually made the Tacoma viable for me, in previous years you could adjust lumbar and forwards/backwards but not up and down. for me that meant I sat waaaaaay too low. Now Its actually back on my list of vehicles to consider if I ever want a truck that isnt EV"
"I agree mechanical seats are much faster. And if you are the only driver, may not ever adjust the seat. I had an old BMW in the 90s that used short sections of sleeved cable between the electric motors and the seat gears and they would pop out or shrink, half the seat would adjust but not the other half. the gears would wear out. repair shop said they weren't repairable.   
I never understood why it was just acceptable that cars let their 12v die - dumbest thing. Even my Prius had it's 12v battery crap out...which ironically killed the entire car."
and usually you don't adjust your seat often...
Unfortunately you‚Äôre replying to a comment about the Tacoma. It has legitimately the worst seating you can get in a vehicle. They needed power seats because apparently they couldn‚Äôt add tilt or height adjustments on a $45k vehicle.
Anyone living in a cold climate who doesn‚Äôt want heated seats is insane and a Luddite.
My 2006 Grand Cherokee has power seats and they are great. Never broken and can be much more precise than manual adjustments.
Only good reason for power seats is memory for multiple drivers. Otherwise manual all day.
Power seats have 12x as many adjustments as mechanical seats.
"I think the better analogy is Apple certainly wasn't first to market with a smartphone. But, when they did enter the market, they had the best product."
"To a certain extent they are opposed though.  Part of legacy makers development cycle is thorough testing of nearly every component.   There‚Äôs little doubt that inhibits innovation, just from a timing perspective.  I think even the most ardent Tesla supporters can agree there‚Äôs aspects and functions of their Tesla cars that could have used further testing.  That innovation Tesla is bringing to market is at times at the cost of reliability.  The comparison to Apple isn‚Äôt a very good one since in recent years Apple really hasn‚Äôt been at the forefront of anything, they seem much happier to rest on their laurels and pump out the same phone in a new wrapper every year.  

Toyota/Lexus has always done it differently.  In terms of tech they‚Äôre always 10 years behind.  Nothing gets rushed into production.  That makes their vehicles a pretty bland, boring place to be at times.  But when I was living on a tight budget and needed a car to get me reliably to and from two jobs and be worth something when I was done with it, there was no better car company.  Now that my life has some flexibility and I can afford multiple cars?  Sure I‚Äôll look elsewhere for the latest and greatest features and gadgets.  There‚Äôs room in this world for both offerings."
Yes! Coasting is the word i've been looking for. Tesla opened everyone's eyes to the huge coast. like decades of coasting. changing stitching patterns on seats FFS. charging for carpet. tiny low res screens. And everyone just accepting that a three year old car was somehow magically 1/2 or less of its new value.
"Electric seats are gimmicky. Electric seats with a memory are not, unless you're the only person who ever sits in the driver's seat of your car (no spouse, no kids, no valet, no mechanics‚Ä¶)"
Power seats are a godsend when two people of radically different sizes use the same car. I‚Äôm 14 inches taller and 100 pounds heavier than my wife. I‚Äôm happy to let the power seats readjust so I don‚Äôt have to do it manually every damn day.
"I'm adjusting seats all the time.. especially on long trips. Electric allows much more accurate adjustments (ie a few mm vs 1-2"" at a time)"
"If I approach my car with my key, the seats automatically adjust to my specifications when I unlock the car. If my wife approaches my car with her key, the seats automatically adjust to her specifications when she unlocks the cars. Is it a luxury? Sure. Is it pointless, well, obviously not. We have a different seating position. It saves the effort of adjusting it each time."
I mean if it starts to really kill Toyota's sales they'll pay whatever exit fee they have to in order to exit the contract.
The good thing for them is in the meantime most people will keep toeing the line and buying the old rubbish while buying into most of the disinformation about Tesla and it‚Äôs tech.
"Absolutely none of that is true. As better chips ARE already available. Why is it that people simply don't research? Even better ones in the future have already been announced for 2022/2023 than what Tesla would have in 3 years.

* Nvidia **2x Orin = 400 TOPS, 130W**
* Nvidia **2x Orin + 2 GPU = 2,000 TOPS, 750W**
* Qualcomm  **700 TOPS at 130W**
* Mobileye **1x EyeQ6 128 40W, 2x EyeQ6 =  256 80W**"
But Lexus says I can tell Alexa to turn the oven on before I get home! I'd much rather have that than a car that can update its self-driving capabilities!
I‚Äôve had the experience that it‚Äôs very reliable. What issues have you had with the interface? It‚Äôs been rock solid for me and I feel it‚Äôs improving each month. I haven‚Äôt experienced a bug in months.
Do you have mcu1?
"I have a 2018 model 3 and my dad has a 2016 cls 550, I find the Tesla a lot easier to use. The cls still had that weird wheel tool as a mouse pad and the screen is set fairly far away from arms length. The user interface is not nearly as intuitive as the Tesla.

Then again maybe the 2020 sls 550 will match up with 2020 model S."
"As a former BMW owner, the Tesla system is less buggy and way nicer to use than the 3 series or i3. The map is so much more responsive and the destination entry is so much faster. Tesla has the industry‚Äôs highest customer satisfaction for a reason. (Multiple reasons in fact)"
You're insane and/or over-demanding. Tesla's software is crazy good.
"I admit I haven't looked this up in a while. A quick look tells me NIO has updated the interface OTA. I didn't find anything that points at range increases, power increase, better braking or any major system update.

When I search I'm inundated by claims that a software update caused an inconvenience to one person. This one ""glitch"" is proof that NIO's OTAs can indeed affect primary systems in some way.

Can you share some of your research about their OTA system?"
"Sure but remember that Mobileye's Vision chips comes out of the assembly line with fully mature software and NN. So everything you see in this video will be in there with very high accuracy and reliability.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaFoq40zUMg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaFoq40zUMg)

So if you are talking about underlying vision system. For example Tesla Vision vs EyeQ5 Vision NN. Then it will be EyeQ5 since it will be there at launch. We don't know the time table of the deployment of the NN that Tesla is working on.

[For example take a look at the comparison of AP2 firmware versus EyeQ4 earlier this year.](https://i.redd.it/578gwi8zu5y21.png)

Another thing you should look at is:

**Full Hardware Use**

Tesla of course is putting hardware into their system that will not be fully utilized for years. That doesn't mean its wrong or that they/others shouldn't do it.

Going down memory lane, Tesla put 8 cameras on their car in October 2016 but were using just two cameras out of the 8 till about Q1 2018 when they started using the fisheye camera. This was when the trifocal camera (which was invented first by Mobileye) from Mobileye went into the first car (NIO).

Tesla then started using all 8 cameras Q4 2018, again 2 years from actually putting the cameras into their cars.

For the computing hardware. Tesla only made full use of their HW 2+ board's compute power Q4 2019. That's 3 years after the initial launch.

Again the idea that simply putting a host of hardware into your cars without software gives you (6) years  of advantage/ahead is completely unfounded and misleading. An advantage is having actual software to go with that hardware and having actual tangible features."
You do know that BMW has \~2000 software engineers working on self-driving in a dedicated campus in Unterschleissheim? I believe that is more than the entire Tesla software team combined (but it is hard to get exact numbers on that).
"It does look fairly good IMO. It also does have a lag to inputs (not necessarily a feedback lag, but the time to switch screens seems a bit delayed). Hmm."
You are right. Dude above you has clearly never sat in a Taycan
"quick online comparison shows i would need to put 25k‚Ç¨ down on a 50k‚Ç¨ car in order to get down to 300‚Ç¨ a month payment.

at 300‚Ç¨ a month it would take me almost 84 months to save up 25k‚Ç¨ interest rates not taken into account because you basically get next to nothing at the moment.

The loan for the car would then run another 84 months at 300‚Ç¨ so it would only take me roughly 7 years to save for the down payment and then another 7 years till the car is mine.

hard pass."
"Tesla would love you to believe that, just like Apple did. But where are the PowerPC chips now?"
Yes I can see it might feel dated but i really hate the lag and my screen lags like crazy. Model 3 that might be fine but my X its price category just is way more competitive.
This would tie in with Elon‚Äôs first principles way of problem solving. There is no pre defined method. Only the method that produces the best result.
"Yeah, nothing new or interesting in in terms of content. I was starting to wonder if we're all reading the same article. lol."
Exactly.
">. FSD was designed for one specific application where the final purpose is already known. You know what data is being put into the neural net and you know what outputs to expect.

A full self-driving system does not exist yet. Implying that we already know what is required of the system is just simply not true. We will not know what is necessary until we reach a functioning system we as a society are okay with.

HW2 and HW2.5 were both advertised as FSD ready and fit the criteria you described, yet here we are."
"The energy usage of The chip that initially launched in 2016 on HW2 cars was 100+ Watts on about 10 TFLOP. Half of the DrivePX2 board which was 24 TFLOPS at 200+ watts.

Today Nvidia has chips (Xavier) that is 30 Tops at 30 Watts. There are even more efficient chips than that available today."
"> they designed this chip to be energy efficient, and cost effective, look at the cost of nvidias chip and energy usage

1) It's still a 2018 design outperformed by Google and NVidia

2) Power consumption isn't as much of an issue for ICE cars

3) The given power consumption values are *peak* only for both systems. You don't run these chips with 100% utilization at all times.


>  I‚Äôm sure they will design increasingly better chips, every couple years to keep up.

Of course they will. Like NVidia and Google will too.

But the article and my comment are about the *current* situation. HW3. And the article claims Tesla *currently* would be 6 years ahead. For chip design they definitely aren't."
"The best analogy is it is the Apple vs Google method. Apple has lower spec chips often that out perform because they design the chip hand in hand with the rest of the phone and the software.

Google has to wait for for Qualcomm to design a general chip that will work across lots of phones and even software, then they write their software. Or worse they write the software and hope the chip keeps up or matches. They can't and won't be able to compete at the very high level as long as there is that separation and lag.

That said, it is the normal trade-offs of business. Google goes for ""work well enough"" and offering lots of options. Apple goes for ""works very well"" at a premium price with a lot fewer options.

Consumers make their choice. Both do very well in the market place."
"I think you just agreed with me.  Its not enough to just make the chip.  Tesla is changing the entire wiring of the car for each subsystem.  With other car companies, many of those subsystems may be made by a completely different company.

They can‚Äôt do it.

Edit- they also dont have the programming background for all thats necessary."
"I dont think it's a plus or minus.  I think you have to look at it from a cost vs reliability perspective.  Take the following made up example:  A) A single $3k point of failure, or B) Ten $300 points of failure.

With A, you have a more expensive failure, but with B, you have more things that can fail."
they are outsourcing. they just assemble like putting car seats.
"The other manufacturers are a little tight lipped on their specifications, ford says it will have a full autonomous vehicle available next year. 
A few other manufacturers already have autonomous vehicles in use but don‚Äôt say what the specifications are. Obviously there are more powerful chips than Tesla‚Äôs already and specked for automotive use.
Besides that‚Äôs not what the article is suggesting. If you have a clue about VW and Toyota you will realise they don‚Äôt make those things,
They buy them from suppliers. Which FYI means that when it‚Äôs available to buy at a price that they can sell to the average person then it will be available to fit."
VW ID3
My 3 year old model S with yellow border around the screen is definitely a mixed bag.
The screen on a model S that rolls off the line today does not have the same screen that one 8 years ago did.
"Here's why they had a ""better"" screen so much earlier:

https://www.thedrive.com/tech/27989/teslas-screen-saga-shows-why-automotive-grade-matters

For better or worse, other car makers weren't willing to use non-automotive rated parts."
"Other than the massive yellow borders...

There is a reason others dont have those screens"
My Model S isn't even 2 years old and the MCU and its touchscreen feel like an old in-flight entertainment system.
Did they fix the rebooting screen issue. I had to use a rented 100D (Model 3 had quality control issues)  and the spedometer screen rebooted twice in normal driving conditions in the span of 30 minutes.
"Um, I'm pretty sure the Escalade has OLEDs all over it which are much better than Teslas displays. Just sayin..."
"Well, my Model S (2018) screen is a POS. It's been replaced twice for random touch events and has the ubiquitous nasty yellow border that they all seem to get now. Tesla uses current off the shelf tech and gets it to market in their cars faster, because they don't wait for hardened, automotive grade versions of the gear to make it into the supply chain. So heat damages adhesives, yellows components, and fries things with way more heat than was expected. I guess if they don't mind replacing the busted stuff repeatedly, they're free to ship consumer grade gear in their automobiles. But now according to them, ""yellow screen borders"" are not a reason for replacing the screen anymore."
"No, because their suppliers don't have it. Tesla's chip isn't ""on the market"" as far as they're concerned."
"Yeah ‚Äî it‚Äôs not just time, but also (A) getting a part that has been certified in some manner to hold up in the expected environment (the early Model S displays had some yellowing due to repeated high heat from parking in the sun all day), and (B) that part being as cheap as f‚Äôing possible.

Also there‚Äôs the matter of how much corporate effort is being put into the actual software..."
"The point of the article was  Installing a controller like H.W.-3 would not be sufficient.  They would also need to redesign electronics throughout the car so all pieces can talk to each other more, set up reliable OTA updates, then try to catch up on software.  This is a many year task even before you talk about autopilot.

the only good news is that second place can proceed faster by following the lessons of the leader.  There‚Äôs no reason they can‚Äôt be caught up hardware wise in 5-6 years. Of course that still leaves battery, software and autopilot, and a Tesla that won‚Äôt stand still"
"No, but the hardware itself is not actually super difficult to clone, so I'm not sure about the whole ""six years"" thing. Neutral network accelerators are relatively simple in design."
"They already do, its aled the EyeQ5, better Deep learning efficiency than the FSD chip"
lol you sweet summer child.
"Ya, most of this talk is out of peoples arses. Automotive is a pretty staid industry. Tesla may be the new kid, but they're far less than 1% of cars made. 

Sadly, for the foreseeable future most all cars sold will not be Tesla. Which means the standard method of business still matters - which is spending as little as possible to make the most profit."
"Tbf, look at what they are starting from. They have a **HUGE** amount of legacy tech, legacy product, legacy workforce, and dealer network to deal with. This is one reason I don't see them catching Tesla. In this race, Tesla started this race 10 years ago, as the tortoise, but kept breeding with rabbits along the way, until that wasn't fast enough, then switched to falcons. OK, silly analogy, but you get the picture. VW and the rest didn't realize they were *in* a race until recently."
"You do realize that pivoting huge companies is very hard, right? Think of all the big companies that went down because they couldn't adapt. Kodak, Sears, blackberry"
"All the ""vast empire"" companies I've seen up close from the inside have crazy levels of paralyzing dysfunction.  It seems to inevitably arise once the organization reaches a certain age and size."
I worked in high management for a company that tried that. Didn‚Äôt go very well.
"They are putting tons of money into R&D even though they are not releasing products. Do you think the Taycan just magically poofed into existence? Or the Kona EV?

The reality is consumers do not want EVs on a large scale yet. So manufacturers are going to continue making what the majority of consumers want, it would be stupid to do otherwise."
"That just isn‚Äôt right about challenger banks in the U.K. - they‚Äôre all struggling massively. Metro Bank in particular is on the rocks but none of the newest, digital platform, ones you‚Äôve mentioned have delivered on any metric either yet, although they haven‚Äôt failed either. (I take no joy in this!)

"Throwing SSDs in aging computers is my favourite upgrade. It's a true huge advancement in technology unlike most of the other iterative improvements, but has been available for years at this point. Mother in law's laptop was unbearable to use. Threw an SSD in and turns out it's just fine even though it's 2 years old, imagine that.

I'm not huge power user either, but I do use Adobe Lightroom to edit raw photos. I've benefitted from building a new computer for it, but I'm using an i3 and everything else is decidedly mid-tier. And it is crazy fast."
"> It boots up in a few seconds thanks to SSD 

No it doesn't. It *awakens from sleep* in a few seconds, which computer manufacturers have tricked most of their customers into believing is a boot up."
"Yeah AA/carplay are complete game-changers. I would never purchase a car without it now. It just makes so much sense, we already carry around a phone all day that contains all the information we want, why not use that?"
I feel a good deal of lag in general operation. I think you'd be very impressed at zero latency.
Wish it were OLED for dark mode.
So you've never used a 120hz display then.
"""it already is"" can be very bad for a technology company. When you are #1, your competition has to be yourself, or you will inevitably fall to #2. So improving on Tesla's own technology even in the absence of any reasonable competition keeps them comfortably #1. 

I bet if Elon gets the tweet about 120/240Hz he'd implement. It's not that hard though I'd assume it would be a hardware, not software upgrade."
But increase heat and no hold up to automotive use as well

What on earth is a heat pump
I'm shocked to hear that the Model 3 doesn't already have a heat pump..
Wow that‚Äôs a crazy big difference
"My racecar has 250m of wiring and that is a really small amount (it's just headlights, taillights, engine and trans harnesses, fuel pumps, starter, alt, brake vacuum pump, water/ic pumps and oil scavenge pump - no HVAC, abs, dash (it's a tablet), stereo, etc..), 100m is crazy"
"I got, I got it! I know the damn words!"
"Oh, that's a typical confirming denial. So it's official"
That movie doesn't end with a traditional happy ending

"I can‚Äôt really hate on Toyota. They really don‚Äôt deserve it. They‚Äôre a good company, they make cars for real people. Yeah they‚Äôre slow, but while I currently can‚Äôt afford a Tesla, they‚Äôre my safe haven from all the other bad car producers."
"Toyota was who I was thinking when reading that engineer quote too. I'm sure they have some of the best engineering talent out there, but it's also a very conservative company that turns slowly.

Some here seem to count them out because of that, but it's why I *haven't*."
I remember when they sent engineers to the local soup kitchen to help them provide more meals more efficiently.
"Instead of micro-managing your suppliers, why not make your parts in-house?"
"> Gohn 

Ghosn?"
"Is that about the time they came from the factory with limo tint, de-badged, a cracked peeling bumper, and a black ice tree air freshener?"
"Feature complete. Making me sad with my Toyota right now. Entune is broken and they will not fix it, even though it‚Äôs literally just software."
Also Security.
Like Ford funding Rivian?
"Won‚Äôt happen. Companies have tried this, but as soon as that startup is getting closer to destroying the parent company‚Äôs main business, they pull the plug."
"You‚Äôre probably confusing a very limited capability with Tesla‚Äôs.

Tesla improved driver‚Äôs assist functionality added DOZENS of completely new features, improved performance, improved efficiency...

Did your mustang updates include all of that?"
No. OTA for infotainment. And that's pretty much it.
"What? Software is iterative, it doesn‚Äôt have to be incomplete to receive updates. Does your phone come with ‚Äúincomplete software‚Äù because it gets updates every few months? Or your computer? Software updates is not a massive security vulnerability, it is actually quite secure due to the fact that you can patch vulnerabilities discovered in the future instead of only ones discovered by your dev and test teams in development"
"This is, by far, the dumbest comment in this thread."
"What?  Toyota OBVIOUSLY is putting shitty products out all the time because they lag Tesla in customer satisfaction.

I.e., there is one single metric that subsumes every other.  That metric?  Customer Satisfaction!"
Which is why a Toyota Land Cruiser will run until the heat death of the universe.
Toyota's conservative approach only works in a mature industry (e.g. making ICE cars). It won't work with the rapid transition to EVs that is happening *now*. Toyota is already dead in the water.
"Sure, but specifically in the case of electric seats, that‚Äôs been a proven technology for a really long time right? They‚Äôve had electric seats in most of their other models for years."
"This! As someone with a partner that is about a foot shorter than me, driver profiles are a game changer."
It‚Äôs not so good to sit close to the wheel once you get into an accident. Just FYI.
Unless you share a car...
"That‚Äôs the thing though. Power seats might not break, but they also might. Seats that adjust manually will always work exactly like you expect them to."
"I'm not talking about their first phone, I'm talking about every year.  

Every year the iPhone comes out and is high-quality and cutting-edge.  Other phone-makers could introduce things like Touch-ID or Face-ID first, but they don't.  Apple does, yet maintains high quality.

Toyota could do the same if they wanted.  They just don't because, for years, people bought their subpar vehicles anyway.  Why make them drastically better if incrementally better sold well?"
"This right here.  I saw an ad for Toyota on Reddit promoting their ""nightshade"" edition vehicles that was just a blacked-out version of the car. That's their cool thing?  Give me a fucking break."
The map the key fob to a profile deal is gold. I literally can‚Äôt fit in the car to adjust a manual seat if my wife has been in before me. Even before that when cars simply had memory 1 and 2 on the door it was worth it.
Memory is key! Had a 2013 camry with electric no memory. Shared the car with my wife. Giant pain in the ass.
"Indeed, it‚Äôs saved my knees."
"On top of that, you typically get more adjustment. I‚Äôve never seen a 14-way adjustable manual seat..."
"it's not about exit fees, it's more about almost being seen as a subsidiary of Toyota. That and Japanese culture of maintaining Wa (harmony) in the group."
"These are all chips optimized for NN, but still not optimized exactly for the type of NNs a Tesla is doing. At this scale of computation, a custom design for the application you're doing is simply way better than a general ML chip like the ones you've mentioned, even if it has 2x or 3x the TOPS. Don't forget that the products of Nvidia, Qualcomm etc are optimized for the needs of many customers, that don't all have the same applications, and not taylored the way the tesla-chip is."
"Lol, I actually added that to my Model 3 for $25 (now $40?) with the Echo Auto. . . Honestly it is pretty cool since it looks a little like KITT and adds Alexa functionality.  But that just makes it that much more of a non-issue when comparing car manufacturers.  

Now Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is a different story; I do wish they would either add the support for it or add more support for things like Audible, Apple Music, and Pandora, and Waze. . .I like Spotify and Teslas navigation but the Nav is lagging in traffic and the Spotify app is just sad."
"Spotify fails to load for me just about every time I get in the car, I have to force a reset by going to the Streaming tab. Last week Bluetooth calls started dropping then reconnecting. 

Two super minor bugs. Other than those things it's a pretty great experience across the board. It does everything I need it to"
"Navigation will not find a route, indicators have no more audio, the interface lags for multiple minutes, the front hood has broken 3 times now and has been repaired under guarantee and still it is broken. The screen has discolouration while the car lives in a heated garage. The flacon doors stop functioning when parked in the sun sometimes. I am sure the model 3 is amazing for its price point but the price point my X was at new the competition is just much better."
"Every morning when I go to unplug, there's a 50/50 chance the plug will not unlock when I hit the button. I love Tesla, but I don't understand why they can't get some basic shit right."
"I am so sorry no clue what mcu1 is. I drive a model X.

Downvotes? For asking a question? Come in guys."
Mercedes‚Äô newest infotainment system is night and day different from their previous system. I‚Äôm seeing a lot of reviewers say it‚Äôs better than Tesla‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt think all of their models have been updated it it yet though.
Tesla definitely forced them to improve miles with proper multi touch but it is the amount of bugs and weird problems like my front hood breaking 3 times now. Or the falcon door breaking in the heat.
"Yes the model 3 is probably nicer but I drive an X and the competition at that price point has nicer systems that lag less. i3 is a failed car design in every way. My experience with new Mercedes, Audi, and Porsche all have nicer infotainment systems when it comes to lag compared to my X."
I would much prefer it not being buggy
"> I didn't find an anything that points at range increases, power increase, better braking or any mayor system update.

Why would they do anything like that? When the cars are purchased the vehicles are already done being developed. There is no need to patch braking, like the non-functional ABS on Teslas vehicles, or range (mpg?) increases."
"Fantastic points. Basically, the article implying Tesla has a 5 year lead due to the FSD computer is downright false since they're not effectively using it yet."
"There is one **HUGE** strategic difference between Mobileye and Tesla, and it's not the chip capability (although everyone is focusing on that).

* Mobileye's systems relies on HD maps (which do not widely exist yet), and they are building a platform where fleet cars will need to generate/update those maps.
* Tesla's systems aims to truly ""teach the car to drive"" the way humans can drive without an HD map, by leveraging driver experience data to refine and improve future performance.

Wildly different architectures requiring very different compute solutions.  Remains to be seen who will come out on top."
"Why does AP2 firmware matter when they're on AP3, which is what this is about? Like literally everything that graphic says EyeQ4 can do that Tesla can't, isn't true, theres really not even a use in posting it tbh.

Anyways if we're discussing car companies - isn't that what this article is about? then Tesla absolutely is years ahead. Mobileye/Intel nor Nvidia produce vehicles. If Mobileye/Intel is the first to reach autonomy, it won't be because Ford, GM, Toyota, or whoever else had anything to do with it. Same with Google. If those companies are successful, they'll obviously have many suitors to put their hardware/software on the vehicles, but again, that's not Ford, GM, VW, etc winning against Tesla. In fact that kinda is them losing as well, because while they may stay in business, they probably won't be making the insane profits imo. So Vs other Automakers Tesla absolutely has a multi-year advantage for Hardware+Software. I mean it's already been a year since HW3 entered new Tesla vehicles, how long until EyeQ5 enters vehicles? 2021 or 2022? That literally is a 3-4 year lead."
You know a hundred 10x engineers are worth 100x more than 1000 average ones?
"Yea, it's not for everyone. Expensive cars are expensive no matter how you work the spreadsheet. Maybe $300 or 300‚Ç¨ isn't the right amount but the concept applies.

At the core of it I'm suggesting that people learn to save and accurately test their budgeting in a harmless way. If someone budgets incorrectly and finds themselves short on funds then they just dig into the savings account they made or find ways to cut down on their cost of living."
"What?  Apple‚Äôs in-house processors are a KEY reason for their market dominance.  Seriously, I do not think you could have picked a worse example no matter how hard you tried."
"Where are panel gaps, in that best result?"
"At the time this tesla chip came out, it was the only chip designed specifically for AI autonomous driving that was going to be used for an actual production vehicle. So, Tesla wont change the chip because it would be too expensive, other companies have come out with better tech, but it costs more, or isn‚Äôt designed specifically for this purpose, and I‚Äôm sure tesla will work on a next gen chip, they probably already have it in design phase."
"You don‚Äôt understand, you are comparing tech that tesla designed specifically for current model vehicles, to tech for future model vehicles, you realize it takes a couple years to put something in production."
"I have to wonder how much advantage Tesla has from aligning the chip/software/other hardware vs the generic NVIDIA model. I like my Android but even I recognize that Apple is able to get a lot more out of their chip/software stack than even Google can from Qualcomm/Android. This despite the fact that Apple chips don't always have better specs or hardware numbers.

The vertical design integration results in far superior efficiency and outcomes. So NVIDIA may be able to do a lot better with their raw numbers but the ability of others to make use of that and the lag of software design coming after chip will have an impact and it won't be positive. We have seen this played out multiple times in the computing industry.

As for Google, call me when they have a real go at things. They don't want to be a car company, and they don't really have any car companies left to partner with that are not already invested in another solution. MobileEye is probably the biggest and most realistic competitor to Tesla. In some ways they are ahead, but they are limited by their partners and the speed at which they choose to roll things out and what they want to do with the data. I think in ways they have one of the best solutions but it is often left hobbled and fractured as a system. If people think Android has an issue with being a fracture development space then watch out for MobileEye as they get a long tail on so many different implementations. That is going to become a nightmare to manage- ask Google and Microsoft."
"Not really trying to take a side, just presenting perspectives on the facts.  I think the big question is not whether they ""can"" do it (I agree that they probably can't)... the big question is whether they will have to, or if someone else can offer an scaled  integrated platform/partnership they can buy into at a competitive price."
"no you still have the same number of things than can fail as having everything in one central place does not mean you can get rid of all of the individual components.

so the problem with overdoing centralizing components is the same things can fail but if only one of them fails you have to replace everything.

its also usually more expensive to manufacture one solution that can do many things than it is to have individual components build for a specific purpose."
"you mean outsource like Tesla letting Panasonic produce its battery cells and also buying from LG Chem because GF1 is not able to supply enough?

Also its not true that they all outsource all of these things, most of them buy the cells and then assemble their batteries like they need them."
"again tell me what other cars are sold with this much on board computing power, should be easy you said its obvious."
"I've seen multiple threads that state Tesla can repair this and others where someone did it themselves.  I cannot say for certain you are in the same boat, but its worth checking. GL!

"My point, even the 8 year old one is still better than some of the crap coming out."
"Granted, my Tesla Time has been in a Model 3, but when I was in an S at the store, the S and X screens seemed blurry and ghosty when panning around the maps. Is this normal?"
I should hope not
"That article is jumping to a lot of conclusions. First, Tesla was in a really, really different situation than legacy manufacturers that had been around for decades - even a century. Tesla made the absolutely right decision to go with the display they went with, even if it was failure prone potentially at ""some"" point down the line. There was simply nothing like that 17"" screen from any other manufacturer - and to this day isn't. The large-screen interface needed to be there, and I'm so glad it was. It's such a draw for so many people. The risk was 100% worth it."
A few minutes of UV light fixes the yellow
"My X was feeling a bit saggy UI-wise. So I took some advice from here and cleared out my list of previous destinations from the GPS.  It took FOREVER since you have to swipe one at a time to delete, but well worth it. Hope it's helpful for you too."
You might want to install an update.
"Which other 2 year old non-Tesla feels faster, or better?"
"I'm not impressed with the Tesla screen at all.

I'm glad there's a bunch of features like Netflix. That's better than other cars. But a lot of basic features are missing, and the interface is the most sloppy and disorganized I have ever seen."
"Death by a thousand latency creeps. ""One more line of code can't hurt..."" x 10,000 and you get a lot of tiny pauses which are insignificant in themselves, VERY hard to measure objectively, and many software developers blithely deny they exist completely. It's one of my pet hates.

But yeah latency creep is a real thing (just look at Windows 10 compared to 7, or new.reddit compared to old.reddit) and I will never stop complaining about it, just as I did [a decade ago](https://news.slashdot.org/story/11/05/03/2051251/the-insidious-creep-of-latency-hell)."
Nvidia makes a self driving chip/board that is faster than HW3.  200 tops compared to 130. Tesla at one time used Nvidia chips.
Why in the world would you need Tesla's chip?
"I did say HW3-like. I didn‚Äôt say HW3, but anyway it means they‚Äôre behind a lot more than just five years."
"Is there a detailed comparison of the 2 available somewhere? I tried searching but couldn't find too much. It also looks like the EyeQ5 is not available yet. Being purpose built, significantly newer, and 7mm as opposed to 14nm, i would be surprised if it *didn't* outperform tesla's chip.

However it'll be a while i assume before it can really take over the market though. Whereas tesla is still claiming the FSD chip can already do the job, and it has been fully in production for a while now. Not only installed in all new cars, but working through retrofits as well."
Hey don't yet destroy all my hopes and dreams! I still have faith :D
Yeah that‚Äôs why Blackberry and Palm Pilots are still doing super well.
Found the executive for Blockbuster video
"I don't know where you guys live but VAG is friggin huge in Europe. Every other car is a VW, Skoda, Seat, or Audi. VW has a huge chunk of the van market as well with their Caddy, Transporter and Crafter models. I don't see Tesla meeting that demand anytime soon with their line-up and production."
"This doesn‚Äôt stop auto companies from innovating, as shown from the Mach E. They will maximize their profits. Plus they need to provide cheaper cars to the public. Auto makers are not years behind and can put in their resources at any moment to easily jump ahead."
"One way lately has been to create a company within the company. Or a fully owned ‚Äústartup‚Äù. I know the Swedish bank SEB has done so with SEBx. It‚Äôs supposed to be run just like a startup, completely free to do whatever they want but meanwhile have access to infrastructure (if they want to). However, I have friends who‚Äôve worked in similar projects and it usually doesn‚Äôt work for very long. One day, the hungry techies tell management they‚Äôve solved something that will make the parent company‚Äôs greatest cash-cow/flagship segment obsolete, and they pull the plug. Then someone else does it instead and you have Kodak."

once you get into photo and video then yeah i see the benefits of newer and more efficient processors. In my work environment they keep wanting to give us new equipment every couple years but all we do is use the computer like a typewriter.
Yeah yeah cold boot is 8-10 seconds. Still a ‚Äúfew‚Äù
Oled is a horrible idea for automotive.  it's susceptible to burn in when static images are displayed.  they are also less efficient at displaying whites and high brightness.  they also have a lower max brightness compared to LCDs.
"Absolutely would not want to deal with burn in as many icons are static (driving pane) which will definitely show up when you watch movies in Tesla theater, etc..."
"Nah, I think automotive should largely skip over OLED until microLED is ready. There's lots of mitigation for burn in, and for a consumer phone or TV that you might keep for a few years that's one thing, but living with that in a car you might own for a decade is another matter. 

We're only years away from microLED anyways, just keep improving the current LCD until then."
the screen already goes too dark for outback driving australia (there is no lighsource for many 100km!). I usually have it on 8% during that time. So no need for oled even though it would look cool.

no.
Tesla never seems to be standing still.
As if Elon doesn't know about higher refresh rates?
Elon enjoys games. I‚Äôm sure he has a monster gaming rig. Pretty sure he‚Äôs well aware of higher refresh rates.
Nobody said they‚Äôre not already continuously improving. Dude‚Äôs just saying the screen is already on top lol
"Oh, that‚Äôs hilarious.  ‚ÄúBeing #1 is bad.  Far better to shoot for being #3 or worse so that you‚Äôre not a target.  They should slow down‚Äù!"
Pointing out that it's already the best is in no way saying they should stop improving.
">Don't know why a cost driver would be an issue on a luxury car 

Because it's a pointless spec bump that doesn't move the needle. Model 3 already has what is likely the best touch panel in any car. A higher touch sampling rate isn't necessary when the current system works perfectly. Have you ever had touch input hz problems on a model 3? Much more impactful to the user is making sure the onboard electronics can drive the screen at 60 FPS smoothly. This is what users notice when they scroll. 

>assuming Tesla also uses similar laptop panels cause 15/17in then it doesn't even cost $100

please read about why Tesla no longer uses laptop grade screens in their cars. also most run of the mill laptop displays are _dogshit_ and should not even be part of your assumptions.

"Pumps heat energy from one place to another, just like fridges but in reverse. Its slower and less effective, but more efficient, compared to just electrifying wires to generate heat and blowing a fan over it like a toaster. 

Basically pumping heat from outside to the cabin, you can imagine it would have very little heat to pull from in very cold climates (but should still have reg toaster heater as backup).

*reddit feel free to correct me as needed"
"It does, that‚Äôs how the AC works. It just doesn‚Äôt have one that‚Äôs set up to be reversible

But yeah, I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt provide it with a heat pump, it seems like the obvious solution

Although it‚Äôs worth noting that even at full blast, your car heater is unlikely to use much more than about 2kW in the worst case scenario unless you do something dumb like open the windows. Moving the car uses perhaps 25 kW/hr, so having your heaters on full blast is only reducing your range by an absolute maximum of about 8% in the worst case scenario

A heat pump would improve that down to maybe 2-3%, which would help but realistically is only going to save you less than 20 miles of range on a 3 hour journey, and probably less"
"Yeah, it's quite insane. Still not sure how the heck they would manage."
We don't yet know if Elon will make it home either....
You thought he was serious about Elon being a time traveler?
Sometimes we're all a little hard for Elon's work.
What is ironic is your comment actually needs that. Because the claim was Elon is a time traveler which you took to be true? Wow.
True.  My only complaint with them is their pig-headedness when it comes to battery-electric vs. hydrogen.  I mean they had the f‚Äôing Prius in ~2000; they really should have been the ones in the lead by this point!
"my first ""EV"" was a modded 2008 Prius. Solidly built cars. innovative manufacturing, recycled plastics, a touch screen in 2006, buttons on steering wheel that controlled HVAC. Very ahead of its time. And then they piddled around for 15 years."
Except they sided with Trump on loosening MPG rules... Massive bummer.
"I think it's just a business decision

At a certain point for every company they need to decide what's core and should be done in house, and what can be reasonably outsourced

Commodity auto parts without much innovation lend themselves to outsourcing.

I look at my house. I gave a couple basic tools that I need... Screwdrivers and wrenches and volt meter and soldering iron. Various power tools. A plunger to fix a clog. I don't have a backhoe to dig up my sewer main if a tree branch destroys it... That I'd contract out because it's not ""core"" for me. 

Tesla's insourcimg was necessary for what they wanted and commendable. Risk big win big."
"This is a detailed answer to your question =) 

https://hbr.org/2001/11/skate-to-where-the-money-will-be"
"Just like Henry ford and the rouge plant?  He was vertically integrated from iron ore all the way to a finished car.  This was 80 years ago.  They completely unwound that.  

Vertical integration is understood these days as generally a bad idea.  In most cases, a business will have trouble achieving efficiency or economy of scale on small runs of parts.  Whereas a supplier can create expertise and service a wider customer base.

The itch to in-house is always present and I have seen it many many times in my old clients.  You look at the supplier margins and variable quality and wonder why you're paying them when you can do it yourself.  But in almost every case, if you've done a good job managing a supplier, their margins are equal to a fair return on capital and nothing more.  Which means you'll probably never do any better yourself from a financial perspective, and you'll have to create a new organization and new business managers and maybe even sell to competitors to achieve necessary economies of scale to earn a good return on capital.  It is a major hassle with little to no financial return.

Plus, the reality is that capital budgets are not unlimited, so in-housing uses up capital dollars that could be spent doing something else, hopefully with a higher return.

It does make sense to in-house if you can't find anybody with sufficient technical capability.  But even then you're usually working on a relatively risky project if this is the case, and you may as well have someone else take the risk if possible.  But given say IP concerns, you might make a strategic decision.  Procurement departments often have a complex rubric for this sort of decision. 

In-housing also more directly ties you to a particular production method or technology, and can make it harder to innovate.  Like by say finding a new supplier with better technology."

"Sort of, although they‚Äôre just investing in, not creating and financing. Different in quite a few ways and not much of a corporate bet."
Did you read the second part of my post?
"Exactly. If I remember correctly, the E-tron recently had a software update that was pretty critical. I believe it increased the powertrain efficiency. Even though the car is advertised as having OTA updates, customers were still required to bring it to a dealer."
BMW even has release notes for their OTA updates. They include improvements for driving assistants and quite a bit of other stuff.
"My phone and computer don't hurtle me through space at 70 mph inches from death.

Tesla has a very bold program by industry standards for live updates considering the typical lengthy and expensive verification process, and the potential liability issues. I'm sure it's considered reckless by most of the industry."
It's actually the only comment that explains the situation.  Whether you agree with it or not.
"Whole I totally agree with you, it's a really stupid comment... It makes me wonder. Is that idea about OTA update actually prevalent at the upper echelons at legacy car companies? Those old guys might actually think like that!"
"Consumer reports often found that the lowest quality cars have some of the highest customer satisfaction. Just look at Jeeps. Incredibly high customer satisfaction that rivals Tesla. But they're unreliable, uncomfortable, slow, inefficient, and cost a ton."
"One word - Prius.

Revolutionary when it came out and highly successful.

Tesla will no doubt carve itself a healthy slice of pie when most vehicles are EV but the idea that Toyota is ""already"" dead in the water is laughable."
"For sure, you just have to consider how Toyota defines the word ‚Äúproven.‚Äù And if the truck market doesn‚Äôt ask for it, don‚Äôt add a potential failure mode."
"I generally don't sit that close to the wheel, but I do have a profile set up for when I have passengers in the back to give them more room that brings me close enough that, in combination with my steering wheel setting, makes it kind of annoying to get out. EE/EE solves that for me"
It's also not great to be uncomfortable when you drive because then you're distracted by the discomfort.
"One thing to keep in mind is just how small the EV market is. Yes, it's growing rapidly but there were roughly 17 million cars and trucks sold in 2019 in the US. The 400,000 plug-in EV sales in 2019 made up about 2.35% of overall sales.
It's certainly not a small investment to break into the market. The market will have to reach a certain size before the expenditures make sense for the traditional automakers. Also, if a traditional automaker is 6 years behind right now and they wait another 4 years to really enter the market, it doesn't necessarily mean they'll be 10 years behind at that point."
lmao i need to google that. I'm sure they sank billions into R&D for how to apply black pigment on previously chrome colored plastic. /s
"Nope, a Neural Network is a Neural Network and is just a matrix multiply and accumulate calculation. That's like saying there is a different type of 1+1 calculation. There are massive amount of people who believe Tesla has some special secret NN. It has been debunked a million times. yet it persists.

Tesla is using the same NN as everyone else. Actually I'm wrong their architecture is very dated compared to Waymo and Google. Infact they previously was using an open sourced google inception network from 2014.

Not quite. Performance is just that performance.

Native Audible support is something I would love to have.
It's actually due to power saving functionality. I think so the bluetooth computer and radio isn't running constantly. Just tapping open the rear door wakes the car and unlocks the charger for me. You can also wake the car by going into the app and waiting until it populates with the car info before you go unplug it.
Car is asleep still. If my phone is also asleep it won't do anything. So either have to wake your phone up so it connects to the car or tap the rear door handle to wake up the car.
mcu is the computer that controls the screens in the car. MCU 1 is older and a lot slower than mcu2. If your care is mid 2018 or newer it should have mcu2 otherwise you have the slow one.

"> Mobileye's systems relies on HD maps (which do not widely exist yet), and they are building a platform where fleet cars will need to generate/update those maps.

> Wildly different architectures requiring very different compute solutions. Remains to be seen who will come out on top.

No Tesla's vision system is based on the same NN as anyone else in the industry. In-fact their NN is currently inferior and unreliably compared to others like Mobileye and Waymo. You do realize that every neural network innovation and new architectures and breakthrough have all been invented by Google?  Its not different architectures. Infant Tesla's NN architecture for a long time was based on Google's public and open sourced 2014 inception NN. Its deep learning 101, its CNN. That's like saying someone else's 1+1=2 math is different. I wish avid fans like you would take deep learning courses and learn how these things work. 

Secondly Tesla IS using HD maps and have been for a while Elon has a history of bragging about things he is not doing and bragging about not doing things if it means it makes him look better."

"You obviously have no idea of their desktop/laptop market. They switched to Intel x86 processors 15 years ago.

Apple marketed PowerPC as their advantage for years, until they were forced to change because in reality, it was not an advantage at all. It was a huge detriment. Marketing is marketing, why would a company ever imply something unique to them is not an industry advantage? It's just standard practice, regardless of it being true.

Are you a teenager only aware of apple in the mobile space or something?"
Apples chips are only dominant if you ignore the massive size of their chips compared to other manufacturers like Qualcomm
Wow. I haven't seen complaints about panel gaps in ages. Welcome to 2020. You seem to be stuck a few years in the past.
"That chip is completely inferior and incapable of autonomous driving. Even the variant Tesla used was half the original DrivePX2. It was 24 TOPS 200+ watts while Tesla used a variant that was 10 TOPS 100+ watts.

I have also posted the next gen chip from others aswell that is in design phase. But let's take a trip down memory lane. There was a huge debate here when AP2 were unveiled and majority said the chip was more than enough. When Nvidia came out and said it wasn't, people claimed Nvidia was lying in order to sell more powerful chips. Few years later now all of a sudden the same majority believe that the AP2 chip is worthless and HW3 is 6 years ahead.

Remember the chip Elon said was previously enough is three generations old and only had 10 TOPS and doesn't even use any of the next gen improvement that Nvidia current chip has.

Let me show you how inferior Drive Px 2 was.

* It doesn't have Tensor Cores (NN accelerator to accelerate large matrix operations and perform mixed-precision matrix multiply and accumulate calculations in a single operation)
* It doesn't utilize Tensor RT deep learning inference optimizer.
* It doesn't have Nvidia's Deep Learning Accelerators (NVDLA)
* It uses unbearably slow pci-e and not the new NVLink 2.0 which was created to eliminate memory bottlenecks (NVLink 2.0 has data rates transfer of up to 300 GB/s)
* It uses miserable slow RAM (GDDR5) instead of HBM2 (+200 GB/S). I could go on and on as there are so many new tech."
"This is exactly what the article is doing though.

And Tesla isn't even really using the FSD hardware yet to this day, so it's all a bit of a moot point."
">no you still have the same number of things than can fail as having everything in one central place does not mean you can get rid of all of the individual components.

Of course you cant get rid of all the individual components, but there will certainly be fewer parts that can fail.  Think about a server hosting 10 virtual machines and compare that to 10 physical servers.

>so the problem with overdoing centralizing components is the same things can fail but if only one of them fails you have to replace everything.

True, but you can have 10 critical components where if any one of them fail, it's a showstopper.  That's no different than centralizing them all and having a failure.  A failure is still a failure.

>its also usually more expensive to manufacture one solution that can do many things than it is to have individual components build for a specific purpose.

I cannot speak to manufacturing cost, but it seems to me that it would be cheaper to manufacture a part integrated with many components, than manufature all the components seperately.  But I dont know."

Because Tesla does doesn't use a traditional automotive development cycle. At most automotive companies it takes 5-7 years for a car to go from design to finished product. I'd bet that there is a car being designed right now with a screen just as good as a Tesla of today but you won't see it for another 6 years because it's at the start of the dev cycle.
This is highly debatable. Early (and even current) Model S/X screens have been plagued with many issues.
Examples of cars with a worse screen but similar price range
"You said ""the model S"", implying that for purposes of your comparison they could be treated as a single model. If you meant to talk specifically about the original model S, you should have written, ""the original model S""."
Well I don't work for Tesla (yet) but I'd imagine since the screen in the 3 is the sole interface for the car they spent more R&D time and money on it
"Silly Reddit. People shouldn't get downvoted for debating if it was wise (or necessary), nor for well reasoned opinions - especially one that Telsa obviously shared since they went forward anyway.  

I have no horse in this game - I was only pointing out to the previous poster why other vendors didn't have a huge screen for so long.  It's not a trivial problem to solve given their self-imposed restrictions."

It actually works in reverse. You can't even buy 100 good people if you have all the money in the world. So getting smart people to stay for a long while and giving them power compared to insanely wasteful giants which doesn't even use the people they have they might literally never catch up if both kept on current course and no monopoly breakthrough battery kills ether completely.

3. there is not yet a choice to match my small SUV. 
4. My commute is too short for the cost saving to make any impact"
"There is a big difference between people considering an EV and actually wanting to buy one. The portion of society ready to buy an EV as their main mode of transportation is just not that big.

Toyota is a very conservative company that turns slowly. Some here seem to count them out because of that, but it's why I haven't. When they show up, expect a decent implantation, while others rushing to catch Tesla have had all sorts of issues. There's few companies out there with reliability as core to the ethos as Toyota, and it shows

Of course it is. Which is the point of making the comment. Not that I agree with it.
"Jeeps NEVER Had the highest customer satisfaction.

"No, the continued existence of each and every legacy automaker is now in question. BMW is definitely heading towards bankruptcy. And, in my opinion, Toyota is heading the same way. There is now a major transition event taking place in the car industry and it will be very punishing on companies which continue to deny it is taking place. That continues to describe Toyota."
"In my opinion, if any carmaker wanted to leap ahead in technology, they could. They would just have to change the way they design and build their cars, which can be difficult for older, entrenched companies. 

Their own old-fashioned ways are the barrier here, nothing else. It‚Äôs the classic disruptor scenario, just like Uber and taxis."
"Saying 'a NN is a NN' is like saying a car is just a car: that might be true if you're comparing them to buses, but that's not what we're doing here and not a useful way to frame it. The kind of computer chip you're going to use to solve the matrix multiplications involved is going to change from application to application because the steps are not the same, the input doesn't have the same size/structure and isn't processed the same way. [Tesla's FSD NN has a very specific structure](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/acjdrt/tesla_autopilot_hw3_details/) which is a *special secret* and it's hardware is optimized for it, and thus more efficient than any of the other chips you've mentioned. Whether that structure is the best way to do FSD is another question about which I don't know a lot, but that's not what we're debating here anyway."
Ok wel then I must have an early 2018 and therefore a MCU 1. And MCU as in Main Computer Unit? Because that is one weird acronym. Regardless I love autopilot but the next car will be either a Honda hydrogen car or a Mercedes SUV full electric. It is my wife who primarily drives it now. I lease my tesla but the purchase price in my country is well over 165.000 dollars and at that price point the build quality and experience is just not competitive besides autopilot. (Now I will get torn apart by model 3 owners whose vehicles were 1/3 the price with the same features)
"Not yet, I have a 2 year lease, but almost I guess. Yes apparently at some point the second computer system was implemented after I received my car. Honestly I would get another tesla at the price point of the 3 but the X is just too expansive for what it is. Next car I want a hydrogen drive train to support other potential technologies so I‚Äôll have to get another brand regardless. I really like some elements of my tesla, I am a not completely convinced yet but maybe when I get the opportunity to drive a newer one I will be more impressed by the build quality."
I prefer my phone over any infotainment system in any car. But besides that no for me it hasn‚Äôt been a good experience.

While the hostile tone? You say I am an ""avid fan"" but I fully admitted that it remains to be seen who will win this race. 
Didn't i just say Mobileye and VW are building out the system to build these maps?  How was I incorrect? Their system needs these maps to function but they are making great progress at making them...I suppose my statement that the maps didn't widely exist yet triggered you?  On that point I'm glad I was wrong/uninformed and their progress is apparently very good.  Thanks for the link. They however have not yet proven they can use consumer/them at scale ...  (not saying they won't/cant)

You make some assumptions about me which are incorrect. I know how deep learning works, and yes they are all basically the same in their methodology.    

It's the complex system choices behind them, (sourcing of training data, how many NNs there are, how you weight them, and how you use/depend on them over heuristic solutions) which can vary greatly.   Mobile and Tesla likely have very different stacking of their NN architectures due to their reliance on different types of data. 

>Secondly Tesla IS using HD maps

Tesla uses mapping data - true, but not HD mapping data.  Big difference, and possibly a poor choice. Tesla's decision to not go ""all in"" with HD mapping data could be their achilles heel, or a stroke of genius.  Remains to be seen.  (If they are in fact using HD maps I'd very much like to read about that.)"

"*10x engineers* sounds so fanboyish lol

We do have a saying in my industry though, you can't get 9 women to make 1 baby in a month. There's definitely diminishing returns as you add people and projects get bigger and more complex. Certain tasks can't be accelerated just by throwing bodies at them. 

But to be dismissive that Tesla is automatically 10x more efficient at everything is silly. There are plenty of smart and talented people at big legacy companies. There's also more bureaucracy, for sure. But I'm familiar with a couple of big companies and the key technical leadership positions in new product development and R&D tend to get the A-team of engineers. I've heard of complaints from executives on mature product lines that every time something new comes along, all their best engineers get stolen.

"My team basically makes a living by picking up the pieces of failed engineering projects.

Unfortunately there are many areas in the trade where ""good enough"" is a common mentality.   1 or 2 of these people on your team is typically enough to slow or halt innovative progress.  It's widely known that Tesla pushes for 0.

Obviously there are shades of grey here but the lesson is that the company with an all-star team is going to be much better off than a company with a ""really good"" team.... and i do not consider myself qualified or driven enough to work at Tesla."
"10x engineers are the exceedingly rare rockstar engineers who deliver the vast majority real innovation. 1000x regular engineers tasked at solving a difficult problem will construct a monstrously complex abomination that will grind to a developmental halt before too long. If they are lucky, some rockstar engineers will be lurking in their midst, and will recognize some key abstraction that vastly simplifies the problem space. If said organization is luckier still, management will recognize their emergent rockstar(s), double their salaries, and spin up a parallel project and appropriately allocate resources to it. But your typical management will be incapable of recognizing these people and they will grow bored and apply for a job at Tesla or SpaceX instead.

Elon Musk is the beyond exceedingly rare ultra rockstar engineer willing to risk every single penny of his immense wealth to satiate his inexhaustible appetite for tackling immensely difficult problems.

Now I will lay my Elon Musk adoration bare: I look forward to the day Tesla and SpaceX are the two largest companies on (and off) earth and Elon Musk is the single wealthiest individual ever. At that point he will be so well resourced as to fund attempts at solving even more seemingly intractable problems like fusion energy.

people do complain about their OLED TVs not being bright enough. the forums are filled with the advice that if you want to watch TV in brightly lit rooms (like a car in the sunlight!) you should use LCD
"Your post is full of misinformation.  I have an OLED TV LG C7 and rtings had extensively documented the burn in that results from static images.  I've also owned Samsung oled phones for the past 10 years and while burn in isn't a problem, that's because the  screen is constantly changing.  Samsung had the always on display and they constantly shift the pixels to make sure burn in doesn't happen.  Just because high end phone manufacturers use OLED doesn't meant its suited for static automotive use.  The model 3 has several elements that will be burnt in unless they employ pixel shifting, which would be annoying.  

OLEDs are simply less efficient at high brightness and often there are downsides when they do get past 500 nits, such as changes to color accuracy.  Tesla screens must get extremely bright to be easily usable outdoors, otherwise it's an actual safety issue."
Not necessarily. You could have originally meant ***relatively*** amazing.
"They have a lot on their plate.  You focus on one particular issue, and Tesla/Elon is focused on thousands.  This might make a difference, but it's hard to just where it fits amongst all the things they are working on (that also could make a huge difference)"
I wonder how much time he actually gets to spend using that system. I'm not saving the world or anything and I only get a handful of hours a week if I'm lucky.
"It's an air conditioning system running in reverse. Just remember that ""cold"" can't be created, but heat can be moved from one thing to another thing. An air conditioning system sucks the heat out of the air in your car and dumps it to the outside. To do so, it ""concentrates"" the heat energy, by compressing the refrigerant, so that it gets much hotter than the outside air. This allows it to dump the heat inside your car even when it's really hot outside. Inside the car, refrigerant is allowed to expand, which causes it to get super cold. A fan forces the air from the car over a cooling coil and the cycle repeats.

If you run an AC in reverse (more or less), it will concentrate the heat that's in the air outside the car and dump it to the inside of the car. Modern heat pumps used in houses can do this to temperatures even below freezing.

Heat pumps are able to produce much more heat than the energy used to run them, because they're not creating heat, but simply concentrating it and moving it where we want it to be."
"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-vU9x3dFMrU

This old house video explaining it"
"It basically works by compressing the air and letting it decompress elsewhere

You know when you spray a can of deodorant and it gets cold? That‚Äôs because the contents are de-compressing. As the gas expands, the particles lose energy and so get colder. When you compress gas, the same thing happens in reverse: it gives off heat because you‚Äôve scrunched all the particles together and they bounce off each other.

A heat pump uses the exact same thing: at one end you compress the gas using a pump (called a compressor), and at the other end you release it from a small pipe into a larger area so it decompressed

A normal heater uses energy to directly heat something by creating heat: essentially you push electricity through a resistor and that makes the resistor hot. If you put 1kW of energy through the heater, you get 1kW of heat (well, minus a little energy lost as light or sound)

But a heat pump works by instead using the above theory to ‚Äúmove‚Äù heat that already exists somewhere, meaning that under ideal conditions you can move 3-4x more heat than the energy you use. So with 1kW of power to the compressor you can move 3 or 4kW of heat energy

Your car or home AC uses a heat pump, so does your fridge. We usually use heat pumps to cool things down by moving heat away, but it works both ways because you‚Äôre moving the heat so you can either move it somewhere to get rid of it (your house dumps it outside) for cooling, or move it to inside your car for heating"
"I got a feeling they aren't counting all of the stuff. I mean the battery have wires between them too. Maybe it's only the drive train, or the main harness."
"The way it works is that they invented a whole new kind of ECU, or something like that (I'm not really very knowledgeable about car systems). Instead of running a ton of wires from one central place in the car, to all the individual systems, they now run just one wire from the central controller, which provides both data and power (it's basically an ethernet+power cable, iirc), to each of a handful of subsystems.

Those subsystems have smarts in them, so they can accept data packets and read them to figure out how to control their particular components. And when their wires branch out to the actual components like door switches and window motors, the wires running from them are very short. 

IIRC, there's one of these subsystems in each door, and a small handful throughout the rest of the car, with the central computer inside the dash. So the front doors each need just a single ~2m wire from the computer to the door's subsystem, and then a branch of wires from there to the components, adding up to a total of maybe another 2m. The rear doors would need maybe a ~4m wire, and then the same branches. Then a single wire leading to the rear seat sensors and heaters, a single wire to the center console, a single wire to the charger hardware near the back, and a single wire to each motor. And maybe just a few more wires here and there.

Writing all that out, I can totally see how this system could require only 100m of wire."

"Two thoughts there: 1) integrating EVs and other batteries into the grid can help 'smooth the curve' and require fewer infrastructure improvements. 2) #1 seems to be the goal of Tesla's latest patent: Integrated Grid Control software that has visibility and control from the grid level all the way down to household appliances, batteries, cars etc.

"So what it going to be, a glorious monopoly of Tesla being the only auto-maker?

You do realise most car makers are owned by other car makers. And bankrupt is often just a brief thing or a change of ownership anyway. MG for example went bankrupt but we see them on our (the UK) roads again albeit in a small way. British Leyland could probably make a return if someone wanted to use the name. Dacia here are pretty much Renault's bag. And so on and so on.

Tesla will carve a niche but thinking they threaten the continued existence of every legacy automaker is ridiculous. For starters, give me one other mainstream, well known, newcomer to the electric car market other than Tesla, that is not one of the old car makers you're on about? And please don't give me a bunch of the high-performance examples. We'll take ones with a real opportunity to overturn/destroy all these legacy car makers you're on about.

Take a look at that well known image of who owns what brands. Is it one glorious company. Not it's 6, 7 or 8 big ones who own almost all brands.

It will be exactly the same with cars, as it is now. Tesla will just become part of it. Possibly a large part.

If for one am glad Tesla exists, think it's a good thing and that the disruption of the existing market and the impetus given to improve quickly is great but the tireless wank-fest that is Tesla fan-boys is... well, misguided. And tiresome."
I really don't think it's just that they're old fashioned. It's a TINY market right now. They simply wouldn't invest in state-of-the-art ground up manufacturing at this point. That's a very expensive proposition with an extremely limited return potential at the moment.

"Tesla produced roughly 250,000 vehicles in 2018. They set a record for 3rd quarter 2019 with 96,000.  Tesla lost money on every one of those vehicles.  There are some manufacturers who are producing that volume with 3 or more models, and making a strong profit on each car.  F-150 sells well more than a million every year.  Before Tesla ever produced a vehicle, Musk had mentioned how difficult it was getting the traditional suppliers to even take meetings with him because of his low volume. He had to improvise, and that obviously was a benefit to Tesla."

No. It will be Tesla plus one legacy automaker (probably VW) plus a number of new entrants probably mostly Chinese.

> For starters, give me one other mainstream, well known, newcomer to the electric car market other than Tesla, that is not one of the old car makers you're on about?

BYD (directly following on my remark about new Chinese entrants).

> And bankrupt is often just a brief thing or a change of ownership anyway.

Yes, I expect car brands to be acquired when the automakers hit bankruptcy (probably by new Chinese EV companies). But this doesn't mean that the old automaker will continue in any recognisable form to what they are today. Look at the acquisition of Nokia by Microsoft as a pertinent example (but one that didn't work out, either for Microsoft or Nokia). This is a *major* transition event and the advantages and assets that the legacy automakers hold today are rapidly becoming disadvantages and liabilities. Very significant liabilities.

Anyway, it's hard to talk people out of denial so I'll stop here. I don't think I'm about to change your mind. We'll all see how it unfolds and I expect things to continue to unfold rapidly, with the landscape being almost completely changed by the end of this decade."

"> Tesla's use of Google's open sourced public Inception Network from 2014.

This is not true! Tesla is using their own network architecture, that since we had ability to check, was designed and trained by Tesla engineers. Their architecture is based on one of the building blocks from the Inception v1 network (hence the term ""looks like"", ""is similar to""), but it is not just a copy of the GoogLe Net, like you are trying to suggest. It's like saying that two houses are the same because their architects decided to use the same type of brick.

More over, since that post a lot has changed. Networks architecture is now significantly different, networks are being periodically updated. They are designing networks that work for them. Those are all recent designs. Just that it is similar to some concept invented long time ago doesn't mean that it is dated."

"Tesla did not use an automotive grade screen in the Model S. It's not good up to the same temps as what would be considered ""automotive grade"" because at the time a automotive grade screen like that did not exist.

But that's a longer term issue the screens would not fail day one.

So what they did was introduce ""cabin overheat protection"" basically the car does not get hotter than \~100 F inside which helps protect kids / dogs if you forget them in the car and also keeps the internal electronics happy.

In addition they replaced a bunch of screens under warranty as they eventually fail. But they saved so much on the screens some of the expense replacing them was justified. 

The result is they were able to use Much cheaper screens that were also much bigger and better.. Exactly why they are so far ahead other car companies would not have gone that route and settled for an ""approved"" screen even though it was a) more expensive b) worse.

Modern day ""No one gets fired for buying IBM"" shit."
"It does explain it, perfectly. 

It‚Äôs why the Model S was $100K despite being relatively barebones. Teslas were made insanely expensive to make up the margin gap that they weren‚Äôt getting on bulk parts.

Remember that whole year where people insisted that Tesla would never be profitable? It‚Äôs for this exact reason. Luckily they hit economies of scale."
Are you just talking about the size? Because the original screen in the Model S was pretty bad. https://www.thedrive.com/tech/27989/teslas-screen-saga-shows-why-automotive-grade-matters
"Are we comparing 80k model s to a 30k Jetta? 

Could be the difference in being able to pay 1000 per screen vs 400 in order to be able to make money on selling the car.

Tesla is a luxury vehicle. Fords or Volkswagen mostly arent. Thus cant buy the same quality components."
"They aren't necessarily. Have you tried some of the modern screens in luxury cars? The new Escalade is all OLED.

Also, the original Model S screen was terrible and not up the requirements of automotive displays, hence why they failed."

"Thanks for your reply and sorry for the implication of you being in denial. My point about denial is a more general one, of that there still being widespread denial of how much trouble the legacy automakers are in. And they won't be going down 'like skittles' because they don't have anything like the lightness of skittles. The more appropriate metaphor, although so overused, is that of dinosaurs sinking into the mud. Their existing massive investment into ICE manufacturing infrastructure is what will kill them. It's going to be very hard for them to 'evolve' when they need to keep the old platforms going (for ongoing revenue).

> the tireless wank-fest that is Tesla fan-boys is

I'm not a Tesla fan-boy. I actually get tired myself of those types (and I suspect a lot of them are ex BMW drivers). But I most definitely am an EV transition 'fan-boy'. To make my bias very clear I hate the legacy car industry and I have always disliked it. I'm not a car guy; I've always found cars a very uninspiring 'technology'. And while I've followed Tesla for a long time I still don't own one despite being well able to afford one. Where I am a fan of Tesla (and Musk) is that they have been the necessary outsider to disrupt the ICE industry; a disruption that was never going to come from within due to the well understood Innovator's Dilemma syndrome.

Finally

> The pace of change already with the last 5 years or so alone is staggering.

Yes, and it's only going to accelerate from here. The last two years with the introduction of the Model 3 were make or break for Tesla. Elon literally bet the company on its success. (A bet that no legacy automaker would be prepared to make). He won that bet and, as shown by the rapid recent climb in the stock price, this is now becoming widely recognised. Tesla is here to stay and that means massive disruption is here to stay. Elon doesn't fuck around and he will continue to push that disruption forward in what I expect to be some quite amazing ways. So yes, very exciting times ahead and I personally will not mourn the death of any of the legacy automakers."
Can you point out this lvl 3 system and in Germany? As far as I know no other car sold can navigate through a parking lot.
"Read the book on Elon, they use *consumer* grade electronics in their SpaceX rockets, they get the price down significantly.

"Not only this, but there have been mixed rates of success with getting screens replaced depending on how old your car is.  Following that, it makes sense.

"The only luxurious part of my model S that my Lexus RC-F lacked is the suede upper dashboard. Otherwise, minus autopilot, my Model S is far less luxurious. The seats are less pretty, less comfortable, don't have cooling/ventilation, and it isn't as good looking. I had a black RC-F with borla exhaust and a set of extenders that raised the rear wing 3.5 inches so even in the lowered state it was raised a bit and looked fantastic. It was quick, it could haul ass past 60, and it sounded incredible.

I got the Model S for autopilot and the EV aspect but it is definitely not as nice on the inside. It does have a fully leather and suede upper dashboard whereas the lexus still had some plastic but that is literally the only part that is more luxurious if you ignore the screens and autopilot."
Tesla is not a luxury car maker. That is a straight up lie. The only luxury EVs out there are the EQC and the taycan
"Why? What ""standards"" are you talking about? There is no standard for in car phone displays. Certainly not one that Tesla uses in any case. Are you implying there is a ""standard"" for cell phones? What could that be? Android? Tizen? Windows Mobile?

Ask Samsung how that's working out for their profits. Or ask IBM how their industry leading laptop business is faring these days. Or HP. The list goes on and on. SMH."
"That is simply not true. For multiple reasons: 1) car manufacturers don‚Äôt make cars if they don‚Äôt have a positive gross margin. Financial statements prove that.

"Well, that is an interesting consideration. Pre planned obsolescence is a thing after all, but your comment made me thinking about system engineering lifecycle and updates. 

Now in the electronic world this is mostly a matter of SW needs (HW not keeping up) and batteries holding up (see iPhones) 

In the car world it was things like drivetrain, engine, hinges, rust, paint peeling, electric connectors falling off, plastic panels disintegrating, sensors failing etc...

Along the years, most of these items became commodities with their own lifecycle driven by companies that were different from the car OEM. 

In other words, all this know how does not reside anymore in the traditional car companies and trying to regain this know how is basically equivalent to build a new car company from scratch.

"That's a bit of a stretch, I think. 

I drove a 2014 Model S60 and it's definitely showing its age. The difference in quality in materials is pretty astounding, the Model 3 is a better car in every single way."
"I said *relatively* barebones. 

Other $100K cars come with a lot more crazy features and creature comforts. I personally think they‚Äôre all gimmicky, but they‚Äôre things that consumers at that price ‚Äúdemand‚Äù to be considered for a car in that class. 

Hence *relatively*."
Schrodinger's luxury car. It both is and is not depending on the argument being had.
"Thats true, but never an annual profit. Im not trying to deal in semantics, nor do I have any inkling of how a mega corporation does its accounting. Im just trying to understand how Tesla offers what appears to be cutting edge tech while more profitable companies appear to lag.  As a casual observer of the car business I thought the fact of profitability was relevant.   And I acknowledred the recent records and expectations of Wall Street.  
Arguing about Tesla is akin to making a point in F1 sub or a few others I already avoid trying to lend real info."
"Tesla has never produced an annual profit, I should have been more specific.  I have yet found or been shown any conclusive evidence to refute my claim that Tesla does not profit on every car.  I google, can you?  And its pretty fuxking easy to post a profit in a quarter when you hide massive losses in another. Am i claiming market manipulation? No, because I know almost nothing about the market or car business, but I hear others claiming it.  So, I posted facts, albeit lacking specificity. Those facts are amended. They never posted an annual profitm and they have been producing for a long time losing money the entire time and that can explain how they have the edge on tech.  Go google son"
"https://www.statista.com/statistics/519579/market-share-of-tesla-in-the-united-states/

"And the company that sells that cable spends a large portion of that cost lobbying the government for that sale to happen, literally money down the toilet."
"That's true but you're still getting a faster car with more mileage and better everything for a lower price

I mean sure the taycan has an incredible interior, but to say the model S was barebones is ludicrous"
"High noise levels, poor paint quality and fit and finish compared to the cars I mentioned. Lack of customised options. Limited paint options. A VW golf 8 is well put together than a Tesla"
"> And the total for quarters is 3

* Dec. 31, 2019	105.00M
* Sept. 30, 2019 143.00M
* June 30, 2019	 -408.33M
* March 31, 2019 -702.14M
* Dec. 31, 2018	139.91M
* Sept. 30, 2018 311.00M

so 4 of the last 6 quarters were profitable and they could have easily slowed down the expansion of new plants and made all of them profitable but they are aiming for 0 profit to slightly profitable right now so they can expand production as quick as they can.

to add to the fun they were profitable in

* Sept. 30, 2016 21.88M
* March 31, 2013 11.25M

as well for a total of 6 profitable quarters."

No. Money to my bank. I work for defense. I appreciate how this eco system exists.
"Model S originally didn't even have center console storage, very little in terms of creature comforts in general. The money was spent on the tech and it shows."
"Sure, I agree a golf is better put together.

But what determines a brand as luxury is price and public opinion. It obviously hits there on price and it's pretty obvious the public opinion is that they are a luxury brand. Regardless of them being the worst vehicle in the segment for traditional ""luxury"" features."
"Excellent info, they are getting there. Does another whopper 400mil loss appear again, wiping all profits into oblivion?  The reaction to this is amusing, because I only provided an incomplete fact that they never posted an annual profit. They still have not, which lends credibility to my claim that profitibality may be an indicator of how they can offer semmingly better tech.  I have encured the wrath of The Tesla Fanboys... a first for me, a lesson I have learned well. Lol"
"https://www.statista.com/statistics/276506/change-in-us-car-demand-by-vehicle-type/

"Level 2 assists driving, has hardware for level 3 but does not operate at level 3 only conditional level 3, can you name a specific feature it has that tesla AP systems doesn't do because I'm failing to see it."
"I can‚Äôt say this is true. There are a lot of things you‚Äôll find in luxury makes that are not present in Tesla. 
 
Passenger QOL additions, for one. There‚Äôs no advantage to riding in a Tesla. The entire fun aspect is driving it. Sure it goes fast, but for the day to day, you‚Äôre sitting in a seat. That‚Äôs it. Compare that to cars that have additional AC control for the rear seating, or seats that are built for long term comfort. 
 
From what I can tell, a luxury car does everything it can to improve the *passenger‚Äôs* experience. Tesla just doesn‚Äôt really do that."
"For EV prices will always be high so that isn't a factor as of now. Quality, fit and finish, service center experience and options are what luxury makers offer. Just look at the taycan and look at say the model S. It's no comparison which car is better put together. Public opinion never mentions Tesla as luxury carmaker but as an electric car company. Mercedes, BMW and others are considered luxury brands"
"What you fail to understand, is that tesla isnt just auto, its also solar and energy storage, as of the last year or so, most of tesla losses are tied into solar. Since tesla is only just now starting mass production of solar v3, ~4 yrs after announcing their initial solar product. I dont see any legacy auto oem making solar or energy storage or charge networks branded with their name on it."
[deleted]
Legislation has limited what it‚Äôs allowed to do and it‚Äôs not for sale in USA.
"That does not change the fact that most people consider Tesla a luxury brand. Just do a simple google search, Tesla is almost always listed under luxury.

That does not mean I agree it is comparable to other luxury vehicles. But since when does reality actually impact what products are called ""luxury"". Fashion brands exist and are normally considered luxury even though they do not stand up."

Public opinion is all that matters here. Even if they are poorly put together people think of them as luxury cars. There are tons of products that are thought of as luxury yet are poorly made, this is not unique to cars."
"Ok, that may be true.  But as of yet, something all the fanboys are so certain of must be an easy google away, 3 times I ve asked for someone to show me they are turning profit on the cars. Crickets feom the several dozen downvoters.  I have no beef wuth Tesla, zero agenda, no money on the table. My sole aim of my first comment was to add to the discussion of why esravlished manufactures appeared to lag in introduci ng tech."
<model x has entered chat>
im asking what is the system is capable of to compare to teslas system.
"When you are aware Tesla isn‚Äôt luxury, I think it‚Äôs disingenuous to call it so. Call it popular, or in vogue, or a fashion brand, but when the conversation is being had among active members of the community, there‚Äôs no reason to try and label Tesla luxury. 
 
Media incorrectly labeling brands is nothing new. Look at the Gaming label. It‚Äôs a joke. 
 
Letting Tesla charge more, and claiming Luxury, I feel, is an excellent way to ensure you never see a truly affordable Tesla."
**Bose has entered the chat**
"> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Luxury_motor_vehicle_manufacturers

from that wikipedia article Lexus is not a luxury brand."
"Im at work and cannot pull numbers atm, tesla has been making profit on their cars since GF1 went up and got into mass production of batteries, iirc model s/x margins are 10-15% minimum, and model 3/Y are supposed to be something like 20% margins, and those margins can/will increase as tesla creates more battery production capacity, heck last week elon hinted at GF5 being in texas solely as a counterpart to GF1, focusing on battery production. I‚Äôll check for specifics later. 

In general though, the issue with legacy oems is the monolithic design and approval process. Tesla goes ahead and innovates non standard designs into most parts of the car. A prime example of such is the frunk. Before the S released, no EV had one, because legacy auto though putting an EV powertrain on an existing platform was good enough hence boring powertrain designs like the nissan leaf. 

Compliance cars are called that for a reason, the first legacy company to wake up and make a semi modern EV was BMW with the i3. Besides sharing iDrive electronics, it was a new design top to bottom.  The primary driving force behind the i3 is now the ceo of VAG lol. Its easier to make profits on EVs when you dont create a platform specifically for EVs, hence design flops that the compliance EVs are, such as the FFE, e-golf, and leaf."

"The system is capable of level 3 autonomous driving
They were the first,
They beat Tesla 
It‚Äôs the VW group that Audi is a part of. 
They are not 6 years behind like the article states in the title. 
Mercedes is the first to make an autonomous truck. They used hardware from the S class."
">When you are aware Tesla isn‚Äôt luxury, I think it‚Äôs disingenuous to call it so.

Luxury is based on popular consensus, by definition, it is a luxury brand because most people think it is. Normally it also requires a premium price, which Tesla has. I would call it a fashion brand, but that is about the quickest way to get downvoted to oblivion here.

Just because I think it does not stand up to other luxury brands does not make it less of one. This is far from the only industry to have this occur."
"Haha, that's a good example.

People typically call them ""fashion brands"", which I do not think Tesla is completely, but if I had to pick one they would be the closest."
"Control + F -> Lexus.

"Haha. You really have no idea what you are taking about. 

The only distinction you can make between crossover and SUV would be body on frame. Such as suburban and Tahoe. 

A crossover is unibody, the model X is unibody. 

Get informed before you talk so much smack."
"""capable"" isnt good enough, what can this system do right now in drivers cars that justifies it being level 3?"
[deleted]
Waymo is at lvl4
"The model X is not body on frame. You have no idea what you are talking about. 

Marketing use the term CUV, SUV, and crossover interchangeably. But when you are talking about dividing vehicles into segments the model X is not body on frame and thus is not an SUV.

"Yes on specific roads it's done 1000 times and still monitored by an off site engineer using a $100,000 sensor sweep."
I think they reduced the price by 90%
"They claim to reduce the price of lidar but dont compare it to a Specific lidar brand but they still have to put oversized sensors on their cars and take significant space for the onboard hardware, so it's a system built for taxi service and not for regular cars because it would look ridiculous and be inconvenient, how does it manage a underground parking lot? Probably not well because it uses satellite images for parking lot data, the smart someone feature on the tesla works underground and without the need of camera's but somehow waymo is ""level 4""?"
"I was watching a video that showed what I think was a ford with a depression in the roof for lidar. 
Car design is likely to change and possibly for many will be how we use cars,

"Made from rolled steel, 23 lbs; goes 90 mph.  Project Name: ankle buster"
"$400 is definitely a hobby-grade price. No specs on the motor? Can I swap in my own brushless motor and ESC? What form factor is the battery (so I can put in a LiPO?) Ball bearings vs bushings? Need INPUT!

edit - most importantly will replacement parts be available?? It's not ""hobby grade"" if you can't even buy new tires for it."

Got an update: says backordered for 1:10 lol
Bought the $20 one even though I was ridiculously tempted for the $400 model
"Am I the only one who noticed that their site made zero reference to Tesla? They refer the to Cybertruck always as 'Cybertruck' even when they talk about Franz they call him the 'Cybertruck designer' Like it is clearly licensed, but I'm fascinated that the Tesla Brand is never mentioned."
No international shipping.. WHY?!
What did I just do? Ordered. I retreat nothing.
"Ordered both!

Nice to note that the order confirmation says that if you use a credit card, it won‚Äôt be charged until it ships. 

My partner is drooling over the actual Cyber Truck but it‚Äôll be a while before we can afford to get one. 

This will be a good Christmas surprise. :)"
"Goddamn Skeletor breaking the windows, hilarious!"
Sold out https://imgur.com/gallery/YEM4U3F
Yeah but what about the crumple zones...  /s
any news on the lego set?
They should use tesla battery cells in the 1:10 scale one
Something I‚Äôll be able to afford after my Tesla calls
"Well there goes $45 (shipping & exchange to Canada). 

Although I really wanted to order the $400 one..... but that would probably going to run me close to $600 CAD all said and done."
"It took me 30 minutes to like the design, yet there are still people that thinks it is ugly.  When I see other trucks now they all look very dated.  I haven‚Äôt been this excited for a car to come out since the Model S back in 2010 when it was at the auto shows."
Hot doggy didog it's beautiful!üòÉ
"This is great, they‚Äôre already licensing stuff so this design is unlikely to change on that actual truck much. Hopefully just add Laser wipers"
FYI If you pre-order both it costs $420.
Ordered both.   Ingenious idea!  These things are going to sell like crazy.
Now we just need a new rideable Radio Flyer
I love how it‚Äôs more than the real things reservation price
How many kWh is the battery pack? /s
This is perfect! I'm ready to see this thing on shelves.
Who is going to be the first to mod this into an autonomous RC car?
Getting the big one for my dad who likes rc's. I hope the specs are very good considering the price.
Awesome.
"I may have ordered 5 of the $20 ones for personal reasons...

"I ordered a couple 1/64s. Can‚Äôt wait!
The 1/10 would have been great but I wasn‚Äôt in a hurry to spend hundreds of Canadian dollars on a toy (bought the 1/18 Model S P85 a few years ago). Plus this goes with my other Hot Wheels Teslas. Here‚Äôs hoping Hot Wheels makes a 1/64 Model Y soon!"

It better be fast!
My wallet.
is the cancel-able. also do they charge now or when shipped?
Goddamnit;l. I have to buy one of these...
Finally a Tesla car I can afford
Doesn't appear to be shipping to the UK. :(
For a second I thought they would make a remote control kit for the full-size Cybertruck.
"#WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANT

I would so take this to work.  It'd be right at home."
I want this. No questions asked
yes
Hahhaha yessssss!
Sold out. $&:!

It this electric?

Totally buying one
"already sold out -fuck this,"
Ah yes. The electric version.
Does anyone know if the 1:64 model is limited edition / short supply or is it just going to be sold regularly?
Waiting for the sledgehammer and steel ball test....
"I need it.

But only if it comes with a Lego Cybertruck too."
But I just want the CyberTruck in the small/regular HotWheels size...

I take ur entire stock
Surprised Nerf hasn‚Äôt licensed the Flame Thrower as a flywheel Rival blaster.
Will sell out in 2.9 seconds.
"It would have been awesome if they teamed up with Traxxas, Axial, Arrma or any other proper hobby grade brand.  I wonder if this will be true hobby grade or one of those ""almost kinda"" hobby grade RCs that you see in retail stores now.  Scale/crawler/trail RCs have become crazy popular lately.  I see TRX4s just about everywhere it seems.  We're going to see some RC youtube channels decking these things out with serious parts or probably basically transferring the body onto a serious model.  Hopefully they post some actual spec details.  I would have loved to add one to my RC collection but I was too late to the party."
They ship only to US and Canada...

"But do they have 500,000+ pre-orders?

Mattel should do a cross-promotion with Tesla: pre-order a Cybertruck, get the Hot Wheels version for $20 now, but you get the $20 back when you take delivery of the full-size version."
The big one is sold out already!
The 1:64 may not be recommended if you have a small dog.  I know mine would chew it up.
Damn. Didn't plan on spending $500 today...
It'd be hilariously ironic if the 1:10 was one of those upscale RC cars that's gas-powered.

Already got an email saying ""Shipping has been delayed."""
FWIW I got a 'backordered' email for my order with just 1:64 models in it. My order status page now indicates backorder with shipping 12-15. So probably just the way their system handles a pre-order.

Nice
I only like brushless motors because I‚Äôm too lazy to deal with replacing brushes. I pretty much just chase my kids around the yard with my RC stuff.
"It might be. Based on the pack voltage (9.9V) it‚Äôs most likely a LiFE pack, the question is how fast can it charge and what kind of connector (though swapping to a deans plug is easy)"
and a WAY better RC platform then whatever shitty toy mattel put under that body.
I want to put the body on my Lunchbox but that‚Äôs the wrong scale. It would be hilarious though.
"I was thinking the same thing. We have a Slash and it is pretty much indestructible, even after upgrading the motor.  For $400 it had better have ""real"" RC parts."
What about the detailed interior?
"Or at least I used to RC.
I have a few beat-up shelf queens these days though technically they still run, except for the Frog that is 30 years overdue for a gearbox lube."

He's going to touch two of the electrical wires together and crash the stock market.
Stonks and electrons. It's a joke with multiple interpretations.
"Same, but it says shipping December 15, 2020. It probably is just sent to show that it's not in stock yet."
"It says sold out so hopefully all those that purchased, including those that received the backlog notice, to receive by holidays."
Yes this is how they handle pre orders. I have ordered before from there.
Okay that‚Äôs fair but even then it is referenced as a separate entity
If you want to learn about them search up ‚Äúinthemoney‚Äù on YouTube
I think it just happened. Curious if they announce how many were sold.
Thanks for the help. Just ordered one

how much for a 2:1 or larger?
"Hey, that's a pretty good size: price ratio! What's the range on the controller?"
r/theydidthemath potential here?
The full size model is volumetrically the cheapest.
...yet 1:4 the reservation price.
1m calls
Or run the others over African stampede style
Expected stock being manufactured.
"It‚Äôs only 3300 mah, most rc cars come with 5500 mah, I think one could swap the batteries - not sure if it will perform better or just longer."
They won't need it. Everyone will know what car that is lol
"I meant the website, it only refers to it as CyberTruck and never once mentions Tesla or the Tesla trademark/logo"
No. Just embracing momentary failure. Which is awesome.
"Or, the far more likely options, they're embracing and taking advantage of an accident that became a meme. Get that passive aggressive smile out of here."
Nice
Also brushed motors are quite noisy. My washer has one and while spinning it sounds like the Model S Plaid prototype in the video Tesla posted.
can probably become very popular on r/pan if you video that
Spec page says 1:1 charge/run time if that helps answer it?
Carbon fiber LCG chassis with Tekin pro motor and controller. Mine is barely a traxxas anymore. Would kill to slap a cybertruck body on it but less time to DIY it these days like when I built up the chassis in the past. Fingers crossed one is available at some point.
"Fuck can that actually happen?

Someone should tape those wires up with some electrical tape! How have they not done that yet?"
I hope so. Bought two 1:64‚Äôs for Xmas gifts!
"The 1:64 isn‚Äôt sold out, from what I can tell."

"Without knowing the run time, it doesn‚Äôt help!"

"My guy, it's basically a few rectangles and triangles.  Someone on another RC subreddit already made one out of plywood.

If I we're going to make one id use 1/8"" lexan panels that you can get easily from home Depot and just glue them together."
I‚Äôm sure it is. Outside of my realm but I‚Äôm sure someone will dig into it.
I just realized this is the first time I‚Äôve seen it without the 3rd row. Looks great!
How soon till we get an Electrek article ;)
"Power struts and ski pass-through, great!"
"I currently have a CRV but I'm thinking about getting a Tesla for my next vehicle. The only problem is I have an 80lb dog and we're planning on getting a second one. The CRV has tons of space for the animals. I was concerned a Y or X wouldn't have enough space, but this is looking pretty good!"
Love the spaciousness. Now I'm wondering if I should switch from white interior to black since my Y will be used for lots of outdoor activities ><
I'm sold that this will be my next vehicle.
Trunk looks great. Now I need someone to place three children between 5 and 10 on the back seats. I‚Äòm afraid that the middle one is too narrow.
BOOM. Sold! Must have really been worried about cannibalizing sales of the Model 3.
All that room !!! Road trips and sleeping in your car seem to be better with MY then the M3. Might consider this in the future for road trips with my 3 year old. MY really didn‚Äôt sell me at first but this might.
Perfect... NOW LET ME ORDER IT IN DENMARK!
So much room for activities!
**Moar**
Black interior with split rear seats! We can finally put that one to rest...
"Any word on a privacy shade for the rear compartment? 
(Retractable or similar to what Model S offers)"
Dog owners rejoice! The only reason I've not got a model 3!
Wow ok ok ok
6 to midnight
"I was questioning whether or not to get a Model 3 or Y, but now I want the Y."
This is thin line between want and need.
I've no doubt that the powered hatchback alone will make this the highest selling Tesla by volume. I'm curious to see how much it cannibalizes 3 sales as I expect it will to some degree.
"That‚Äôs a big trunk! It actually has me concerned that the back seats won‚Äôt have enough leg room! 

I plan on switching from a CR-V and the rear passengers always enjoy the extra leg room compared to a sedan."
[Picture in JPG format of TMY with 2nd row folded down](https://i.imgur.com/H3siDOf.jpg)
We can ice fish like Matthew.
I wish they offered some type of brown or tan interior. Or is the trunk still black with the white interior? Sorry I‚Äôm a Tesla noob.
I want it nowww!
Argh. Want one. I kinda miss the room I had in my CR-V. Anyone want to buy one and even swap me for my 3? Heh
And this has sealed the deal. Can‚Äôt wait to put my order in the UK
"does anyone know how high the model y is off the ground? model 3 is way too low for me and model x is way too expansive to buy.

model y seems like the one model that would fit my needs perfectly but I don't know the exact number.

atm i drive audi q7 and kia sorento and if the model is off the ground height it similar to those cars I'm definitely getting model y"
Did you get a chance to measure the trunk?
just placed an order after seeing this....cant wait!
https://y.yarn.co/15655352-dcb0-4248-9797-39fb6c022645_text_hi.gif
This is what the 3 should have been.  :(
Looks to be a good size!
I would love to know how this trunk space compares to the new 2020 Highlander. We have placed an order for a Y but the Highlander keeps rearing it‚Äôs ugly head in our dinner conversations. For context we have a Model 3 AWD 2018 Nov model.
Now i just need to actually see one before i can get my wife on board. This pic is the one I have been waiting for to show me it's spacious enough in the back.
Reminds me of my old Saab 900 hatchback
How is rear visibility? From this angle it looks like it won't be very good
40/20/40 second row structure finally. This really IS like living in the future -.-
Sold! Just ordered it!
Nobody is talking about how big the subfloor area is. On the 3 it is huge.
The only feature I‚Äôm jealous of is the ski pass through. I can‚Äôt believe they didn‚Äôt add that in the M3. Very annoying
Finally! I want to know if this will work for my 75lbs pup! Looks pretty good.
"This will be so much easier for ""camping"" since you can climb in the rear and then power-close the liftgate, versus awkwardly climbing in the passenger door and flopping around like you have to do with Model 3."
Space. Space! I love space. Going to go to space. Spaceee!
Where is the 3/middle headrest?!?
I'm really interested in the car camping potential of the y. Looking good so far!
Anyone else wondering if there will be a trunk cover so your stuff is out of sight?
There's so much room for activities!
I‚Äôm about two weeks out from getting my Model 3 and I really wish I held out and preordered a Y :/ I tend to like crossovers more than sedans and I‚Äôm fine with waiting a year or two for it
Reminds me of my prius.
Gimme.
Nice üëç
Roomy
Not to mention the extra cargo space under the bottom layer there.
not too far off the model s trunk not bad
Get hype
That looks just like my rogue ...
"Has anyone confirmed the seating position for the front seats? Like are you as YouTube as in the X?

We have a 2019 outback and the seating is not as high up as we would like."
Can I get a backseat photo?
"Looks awesome. I was about to pick up a package today with my model 3. It was a normal sofa table from my local Craigslist equivalent. 

I actually had to give it back to the owner because I couldn't got the damn sofa table in the car ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¨"
"This looks *great*, and more excited than ever about our reservation...but still cant actually buy unless it has a trailer hitch!"
no snow but a jacket-somewhere not south!
Sweeeeeeeeet!!!!
Wow that's a lot of room!
"Wow.....look at all that space for jackets. Lol. But seriously, that's some good storage. Really want to see the third row."
"Hinge at middle of trunk floor for better access of bottom trunk, no?
Storage above wheel arch, no?
Headrest for middle rear seat, no?"
That's hot
This pic really lifted my gate üòè
gif of the lift liftin pls for this reservation holder
I wonder if they've fixed the folding of the rear seats or if these will suffer from broken quartet windows too.
Wonder if a set of golf clubs will fit in the under trunk area.
"Judging by the strut, my impression it is a manual trunk. Anyone else have an opinion? Haven‚Äôt heard much about it being automatic, but I do wonder."
It looks like the sub trunk stops where the 3rd row would be. I wonder how you would get to the extra storage that the 3rd row takes up?
Automatic?
This picture made me like the MY
"Does anyone have a sense of how deep that is in inches? Have we seen any figures for the dimensions (depth, width, height) of the cargo area? I want to figure out if our dog kennel crate will fit back there!"
"This makes me hopeful. I need 80+"" between the back of the front seats and the closed gate, and this makes it look like it might be possible. My order will be put in the moment that measurement is confirmed."
"Hopefully by the time my Mazda kicks the dust they're not over 70 grand Canadian, starting. If the 3 was a 4D/H I'd already be driving one, but not going to pay an extra 20 grand to do so right now."
Yes please!
Looks great. This is what 5he 3 should have had.
Finally! A good picture of the boot! Now I can get this car.
That banana box test is looking GOOD.
Any idea how close the trunk lip is to the floor? I love how flat they are on some hatchbacks like Subaru. Really wish they'd done this with the model 3
Still wish they'd offer a station wagon.
I see a gap for rain.
Wow!
He really went all out. S 3 X Y.
Hi
"My real question is, can I fit snowboard and skis in there without folding down any seats?"
Looks like it will fit 2 full suspension ebikes easily. Perfect.
I really wanted to buy a M3 but seeing this and reading comments has me quite split.
"I‚Äôm excited to hear what people think about the noise levels in this car. If I drive with the back seats down in my 3, you get a lot more road noise. I hope they‚Äôve managed to soundproof the rear of the car way better than they did with the 3, since the trunk isn‚Äôt blocked off by the seats."
Massive boot
"I have a baby. I can see how the Y is a really good family friendly car with the third row. You can put the car seat there and accommodate visiting guests in the back seat. 

I have an S. Today I will have to rent an SUV to accommodate 2 infants and 4 parents because there are no additional seats in my S."
Oh wow!! That‚Äôs spacious. Being looking to replace my second ICE with the Y(so I can have a matching set with my 3). This looks more like an Outback or Ascent type space. There‚Äôs no business choosing the 3rd row on the Y it‚Äôs going to be so cramped. There are probably 3 car models on the market that have a functional third row.
Sold!
"So... I‚Äôm guessing the floor is a panel flap that can reveal an even deeper storage well?

In 3 years I‚Äôll be car hunting... Model Y is looking more and more compelling."
"As long as the 58cm fits, I‚Äôll be happy. https://i.imgur.com/uYjJRpb.jpg"
This is how I hoped the 3 would be when the prototypes were going out.
Europeans around the world rejoice!!
"Does anyone happen to have the height of the trunk? Trying to figure out if the cage of my big dog would fit :) 
More info: the cage barely fits (height and length) in my audi q5 if that is something to compare"
"This is great to see, although I guess none of us familiar with the 3 should be too surprised.  The trunk in that hog is cavernous AF for a compact sedan, and the Y essentially makes it a bit taller and takes the lid off.  Should be great for daily hauling!"
"From this angle it looks to be about the same size as my older Lexus, which is what I was hoping for, also folding down 1 or 2 of the seats will give you even more room. Stoked."
"Can we get some more real pics like this of the driver's seat view, drivers footwell area, and center console please? The official pics don't give a great view of this.
I'm hoping the center console keeps low and there is more knee room and right leg room."
"Looks like this one is missing that little trunk hideaway :( I love that spot for storing car cleaning supplies.

Edit: am blind"
Looks small. But not too bad. God knows about the third row seating
3rd row will be a joke!
It's much bigger than the one of the 3 right?
"Model Y is just a Model 3 hatchback. I love it. 

Since we have no kids, I'll keep the seats down all the time and put that thing to work."
What are the wires in the right hand part of the picture?
Wow looks like a car
Seems like there is enough space for kidnapped dead person.
People should put their clothes in the frunk.

Hyped af for the cool looking fast Prius
"Wow, the  trunk doesn't seem as deep as I thought."
Shit in it.
OMG its a.....Car √∂
That actually looks about the same size as the Model X cargo area with the last row folded.
"I‚Äôm glad third row is an option but I could never personally imagine myself even close to getting it. I still remember the reveal of the model y, the people in the back looked so cramped! I‚Äôd much prefer this"
The 3rd row is there just folded look closer you can see the fold down line.
2-3 hours. Mark my words.
They need to wait a little while for Reddit comments to tell them what to write
That's what the website is for. Not every electrek reader is a redditor. What's the problem? You do realize websites like this used to exist way before social media became a thing right?
https://electrek.co/2020/02/24/tesla-model-y-trunk-pictures-cargo-space/
"As fast as you can say ""clickbait"""
how can you tell that the struts are powered?
"I love the ski pass-through. On my 3 I have to fold 1/3 of the seat, and x-country skis would be too long to fit."
"That‚Äôs exactly why we cancelled our day one reservation on the 3 and are holding off for the Y.  Between two dogs and a potential kid seat, it wasn‚Äôt the most sense.  This checks all our boxes."
"X is huge, fits 7 adults."
"Yep, I‚Äôm excited for the Y too!

I was really disappointed when the Model 3 wasn‚Äôt a hatchback. I‚Äôm definitely not alone there."
Wuh huh? Why were you concerned about the X? I have an 85 lb lab and a 65 lb lab and they both fit in the 2nd row. They‚Äôd prob fit in the 3rd row too.
"Looks very similar to CRV trunk, right? That was my first thought."
I have a CRV and a model 3. The interior envelopes are quite similar. The kids prefer the back of the Tesla actually because the seats are better and it farts when I turn. The Y is going to be quite roomy.
"Yes. 

Look at how dirty even the tan interior option gets on your typical Subaru... the white is a magnet for dirt and blue jeans dye."
I've gone on over a dozen camping/hiking trips with my white interior and it's held up great and has always been easy to wipe clean.
"Model 3 can fit 3 car seats, so Y should be capable."
Might work at that age but my 15 & 17yo fight over who gets to sit behind the shorter adult in our M3. Good thing one will be leaving for college soon or we may have to trade in for a MY.
I had to buy 3 narrow car seats to fit in my 3. They barely fit.
"Why are so many Tesla owners sleeping in their cars? Is this what you do just to afford a Tesla?

Not being a dick, being serious. I see it constantly here and can't imagine not just getting a hotel room. The only time I sleep in it is when I get my timing wrong and I'm so exhausted at the supercharger still an hour from our hotel that I fall asleep for an hour.."
"Now, reading your post, If the Model 3 would have been Model E,   the accronyms would sound so selfish."
"Elon, *Do it for Denmark.*"
"Tell me about it‚Ä¶ another year, sigh."
"Just a word of advice, I really don't recommend being an early adopter when it comes to Tesla, at least not in Europe.

The European releases of the dual motor Model S, the Model X and the Model 3 have all been shortly followed by either price decrease or model upgrades. That in combination with that every release have been riddled by delivery problems, misconfigurations and just overall chaos.

There is exactly zero benefit of preordering the car. Even if you just wait a month after release, you will with almost certainty have a significantly better experience and likely even a better car (e.g. both HW2 and HW3 were released barely a month after the initial EU deliveries of Model X and Model 3, respectively)."
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Yes... activities.
"I especially want to see pics of the backseat. Hopefully there's more space than Model 3, especially for rear facing car seats."
I mean the pic on the website has been black with split seats the entire time.
You know BMW would charge 1000 for that
Am wondering the same thing. I hope Tesla will offer it or maybe a 3rd party will come out one.
"It should have the, what I‚Äôve heard is quite large, sub-trunk under those panels at least"
This picture is probably the thing that makes me wish I had a Y instead. Otherwise I'm not too big of a fan.
"if you're talking about the 3rd row, then yeah... it won't have that much room, but the second row will be fine for fully grown adults to take a road trip in."
The only downside to this images it doesn't really give you a great idea of the depth since it's straight on.
Still black
We have a CRV and a Model 3. Will probably sell the 3 & the CRV and buy a Y + a ZOE or something similarly small EV
"The 3 is super low to the ground; it's a bit of a chore to get in!  No official numbers have been posted on the Y, but based on some sleuthing:

* [https://cleantechnica.com/2019/03/15/tesla-model-y-off-road-ability-what-we-know-so-far/](https://cleantechnica.com/2019/03/15/tesla-model-y-off-road-ability-what-we-know-so-far/) 

>The clearance appears to be around 6‚Äù in most places, and closer to 5‚Äù where body panels are curved downward to decrease drag. Obviously, it should be clean and smooth underneath, especially considering the 0.23 drag coefficient Musk gave during the unveiling. This means that the major drive components are up and out of the way, which should be better for off-road use.

It's unknown if it has air suspension.  One trick they can use to get around the low-ish ride height is by taking advantage of the heightened bubble & putting the seats in higher, so rather than stepping down so much like you do in the 3, maybe it can be more of a slide-in situation.  It also looks like it will be nearly as tall as the X, so it should be pretty roomy!

* [https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-y-size-vs-model-x-pictures/](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-y-size-vs-model-x-pictures/) 

>The Model Y was covered in tarp when it was photographed, but one could see that it was just as tall as the Model X. A recent sighting of the Model Y in Mountain View, California  revealed that the crossover‚Äôs height is about 65 inches. The Model X, on the other hand, has an overall standard height of 66 inches but can vary depending on the air suspension height setting. The ground clearance of the Model X ranges between 7 and 9 inches.

Tesla is in a tricky position:

* The 3 & Y interior design is far ahead of the S & X, modernization-wise
* Buuuuuut they don't want to cannibalize sales, so even though the 3 *could* go faster, it's limited, for the same reason it's missing air suspension & a heated steering wheel (I think it's crazy you can spec out a 3 at $65k fully-loaded & not have a heated steering wheel!)
* Americans love love *love* crossovers; the Y is going to be a HUGE hit
* But, they did shoehorn the Y design onto the 3 chassis, which Musk said he didn't want to do, so it's not going to be as perfect as an all-new platform would have been

I think that long-term, the Y & the Cybertruck will be their best-sellers.  Current estimates put the Cybertruck pre-orderin at more than 500k.  So I'm hoping they put a lot of goodies into the Y as I think it will become their top-selling car long-term.  Especially with that great trunk!"
I think they knew this would sell more but also knew they would have a major challenge ramping up their first mass market vehicle. They did the 3 first because they would have had even more pissed off preorder people had they done the Y first.
I still prefer the 3 over what I‚Äôve seen so far of the Y. I‚Äôm glad there‚Äôll be the option and it doesn‚Äôt have to be either/or.
"yep, we plan to sell our 2017 highlander for a Y, but only if the full trunk space w/seats down is good enough (it wont be equal to highlander, just needs to be good enough for the stuff we often haul for travel and work)... but more than anything it needs *a trailer hitch*. I really wish they would say something about the trailer hitch b/c its a complete non-starter without it."
84 cubic feet vs 66 with seats down? about 21% more in the highlander per specs.
Was thinking the same thing
"I've also read there are likely to be two bins instead of just one, as well as deeper than the 3's.  Would make sense if you think about a footwell area for a 3rd row of passengers if not equipped that way."
Cancel and wait! You still have the option!
"Bought an electric scooter from amazon that came damaged and had to return it.  I always do this by taking the box to work with me and printing a label to slap on the box and leave it at my company's UPS drop-off location.   I literally have never been able to NOT fit an amazon box into any of my cars in the past (always had a hatch of some sort between the Honda Fit EV, RAV4 EV, VW E-Golf, and Bolt EV).   But due to the dimensions of the box and the super weird opening of the Model 3, it was impossible to fit the thing in the trunk.  

And how's this for irony:  after buying the Model 3, I ended up buying a kids Tesla Radioflyer Model S car off of craigslist.  I couldnt fit the flattened box and the toy car in the back of the Model 3, so I had to pick it up with my Bolt EV instead."
Or the interference with the headrest when when you fold the seats down.
"If the 3 is any similar indication, it's unlikely length-wise."
"Everything I've seen so far has said that it is automatic. Of course, none of that is straight from Tesla. I sure hope it is powered though!"
"How old? It's hard enough to get a rear facing car seat into a back seat, a 3rd row will be even more difficult. That's if it fits (second row has ability to slide first row forward. 3rd row doesn't get this option in many smaller vehicles)"
"I have an X and a 13 month old. Carseat does not fit in 3rd row of X, so will definitely not fit in Y."
Why do you think that? (the handle is clearly visible)
What makes you think that? The lid has a loop to grab on to and looks like there‚Äôs a fold around the middle of the trunk just like in the Model 3.
"I just purchased a vacuum that plugs into the lighter for my Model S. So between that, microfiber cloths, and ecogreen cleaner, I can detail my car while charging."
Why no spare tire tho
Costs way more.
Can you put down the 2row too?? So it‚Äôll all be flat
Probably the charging cord.
charging cable?
"Though, since we‚Äôre talking Tesla, I think it‚Äôs safe to assume M3 is not the BMW but the Model 3."
and it has that false floor cover you can pull away to reveal a deeper well.

"i had 3rd row seating as a little kid taking road trips from ohio to myrtle beach. i always had dibs on the 3rd row, but i was the only one there, i was able to lay down across both seats and take a nap. forget actually putting two people back there unless they are tiny children, but i really appreciated that 3rd row on those trips. 

you basically gotta get into the pricey luxury SUV‚Äôs to get 3rd row seating that can fit an adult-sized adult comfortably"
It would be PERFECT for my family. We have a Prius Alpha (7 seat prius) and chuck the kids in the back when carting my parents around or when we have extra kids in tow. Its very useful. Would LOVE a Y just for that feature.
"Not huge, but surprisingly accommodating. And I'm tall!"
Or that line is where it folds for the lower compartment of the trunk. Unless we‚Äôre looking at 2 different lines lol.
"That isn‚Äôt the third row, that is the line for the storage compartment."
"Seems odd the 3rd row variant is going to be released so far after the 2-row, but most of the test mule photos appear to have 3rd rows. If that crease is indeed the folded 3rd row, I'm not sure we've ever seen a 2-row version? The jackets are conveniently covering the vertical line separating the individual 3rd row seats so it's hard to tell."
How long after that until it's reposted on reddit as original...
"It's been 2 hours and 45 minutes, and there doesn't seem to be an Elektrek article about this yet. Color me surprised."

It's been 3 hours and I don't see an article yet. When do we panic and assume that someone has kidnapped Fred?
"I'm not annoyed that Electrek exists, I'm annoyed that info from this sub is recycled into an article on there and then posted here.

Sounds like the mods are aware and are making plans.

I have no problem with Fred and company using this subreddit as sources and posting articles, it's just a little much to read everything twice."
"Thank you. Reddit has voting. I think we‚Äôre jumpy at having 3 major things 1, 2 or 3 months away."
Reading elektrek is like investing in a fund that only holds tsla. You may as well just come to the source
Girth.
"what‚Äôs unclear is whether a 29‚Äù mountain bike will fit or not, with only front wheel removed."
"I have the Model 3 and I have two dogs (golden retriever and a cavalier spaniel) and a 5 month old. The spaniel rides up on my wife‚Äôs lap and the golden tries to squeeze in the back seat and ends up resting his head on my daughter‚Äôs feet in her car seat.
Trading in for a Y isn‚Äôt a financially good idea with the depreciation of the 3 now, but I would love that extra space that I think the Y provides.

Wife might trade her car for a Y later, but just saying, it‚Äôs a bit tight.

(Better than the mustang I had before this though, so it is still a better family car.)"
"True, but it cleans off really easily. Just a quick rubdown with baby wipes will bring back that pristine white."
">I've had our white interior Model 3 for almost a full year and have 2 toddlers.  The white seat have held up 100% are easily cleanable.  In fact, the only negative material or quality issue we've had is with all the plastics (seat backs, console center in the rear, glove box, etc).  But those white seats have held up amazingly well, better than anything else with the car (i'm looking at you, exterior paint)."
I have actually not had this experience. Had white interior for almost a year in the model 3 and they still look brand new
Do you have the white interior? Everything I‚Äôve seen from owners that have it say it cleans easily and no residual marks.
Thank you for the reassurance on the white interior :)
"Just discovered this [video ](https://youtu.be/E4oqmLIhVV4) 

Seems to fit quite well."
"Can confirm I can fit 5,3 and a baby :)"
"Depends, in my Model 3 I can fit only a single full-sized rear-facing car seat and only behind the passenger seat because my wife is smaller than me.

It'll hit my seat in the middle or behind me."
The 3 rear seat size is limited and if two very tall people are in the front the rear size is compromised.  But for most people under 6 feet the rear passengers should be comfortable unless they are also very tall
"When you can leave air conditioning on, it becomes a pretty serious step up from tent camping."
Because you can have AC running without exhaust gas.
"I have a fear of bed bugs.... and I'm more mobile in my car, not tied down to be anywhere by a certain time."
"Eh, just nice to have the option. 

Plus this is more of a thing in some regions of the country and for people with certain lifestyles. I have some friends in Arizona that go hiking / camping a lot and they normally have the rear seats out of their Xterra because they often use it as a tent. A lot of the best hiking / nature destinations out west are 100 miles from a hotel, or the motels that are available are pretty sketchy.

Obviously if you are extremely tall, extremely wide, have kids, or disabilities, that won‚Äôt work for you. But for some people it works really well. 

Even a non-climate controlled car is a much better insulated tent than a nylon tent. A Tesla is pretty good compared to a tent."
"Some people like tent camping. Some people like car camping.  Teslas offer some extra advantages to the car camping option, so people like that and talk about itm"
"I‚Äôve only done it (slept) 2 times, both times unplanned with air mattress that I keep in frunk. 

The available option makes me take trips (probably a dozen + times) that I otherwise probably wouldn‚Äôt and drive later into the night than I other wise have. 

I‚Äôd consider planning on sleeping in it for a special location/ event, but if there is hotel availability it would be highly unlikely for me to plan on sleeping in my Model S."
If I have a lot of relatives over the garage becomes an extra room to sleep in.
Glass roof and stars
"Cheaper than getting a hotel and don‚Äôt you think that‚Äôd be fun,Sleeping in the back of ur car? That‚Äôs one of the main reasons I‚Äôm getting a Y over a 3"
It‚Äôs more like really fun camping than crappy hoteling. I actually slept in my M3 in my garage while my floors were being refinished in my home. Comfortable and easy.
"> Why are so many Tesla owners sleeping in their cars? Is this what you do just to afford a Tesla?

Because why *shouldn‚Äôt* I sleep in my Tesla? I‚Äôve slept in most of my other cars, and a Tesla with phone-controlled climate is downright luxurious compared to the others. 

I can afford not to, but I also don‚Äôt care for frivolous expenses like hotel rooms."
"I currently don‚Äôt have a Tesla. But, if I did I could see myself sleeping in my car while I wait for my first class in college. I commute so I have to arrive early bro get a parking spot."
Car camping in a Tesla is awesome.
"For one thing if you sleep near other Teslas with people sitting in them at the time and coming and going all the time, such as in the same parking lot as a supercharger, there is a higher margin of safety than with sleeping in a car in a random place with no friendly people around. There are other factors that others have mentioned. I think it‚Äôs a combination of things."
"I slept in my cars countless times when going at outdoor parties/events.
Not having to bother with a tent is nice."
Because some people *like camping*. That's why there are campsites and hotels. People like different things.
"I think the reason is because many Tesla owners weren't driving sedans before, but rather 4Runners, Explorers, Foresters, etc. and that crowd wants to maintain their driving/life style even if they're now in a sedan."
"I have one of the first 20 model 3s in Europe and I've had no issues except for a misaligned chrome strip that Tesla fixed quickly.
Just my experience."

"You mean like sex? Are you guys talking about sex? Is that what you mean by putting quotes around ""activities"" because it's code for sex? Wait, you didn't put quotes around it. But it still means sex, right?"
"My hope as well. Even if the wheelbase is similar, the more upright seating position may help with the rear facing seats"
Everyone was freaking out that the description had split seats only on the white interior.
Porsche would charge $4800.
"To get a BMW up to the same level as a similarly-sized fully-loaded Toyota (e.g. BMW X5 vs Toyota Highlander Platinum) you would spend an extra $30k+ - which could get you a second decently-loaded car. It's horrible.

Tesla seems to be the only luxury-priced manufacturer to include a solid amount of equipment on the base trim and not require one to spend $30k+ to match a non-luxury model in options."
No just the second row. I know in the model 3 it‚Äôs tight so I‚Äôm hoping on the Y it‚Äôs further back even with all this trunk space.
Many thanks.
Elon has said no air suspension.
I love my 3.  Only thing I would change is the bar in the trunk; makes putting large items impossibly difficult. Wish it were a hatchback.
"Thank you so much. Yes a hitch is a must. Not so much because of towing as such but rather to be able accommodate a bike rack. Yes I know there are other options but a hitch version is just a lot more sturdy and safer. 

Check out this link I saw a while back. 

[Model Y spotted with hitch](https://www.google.com/amp/s/electrek.co/2019/12/03/tesla-model-y-prototype-spotted-tow-hitch/amp/)"
Seats down. Do you mean the second row or the third row. I assume the 2nd row?
But I‚Äôd like the future to get here in two weeks vice 2+ years
"All of your other vehicles were hatches which have a lot more practicality than a sedan.  I‚Äôve moved so many things inside an old Prius, and all the functionality a hatchback gives is one of the reasons I chose to wait for a MY over the M3:)"
"It‚Äôs weird, I haven‚Äôt seen anything either way. The one data point I am going off is the Model x had auto trunk while it was still an option on the Model s, so maybe the Y will?"
"Oh you're totally right! My bad, thanks for the heads up"
"Good spot, had my phone brightness pretty low so i didn't see it."
I do something similar!
"Just curious, what model?"
Lots of cars don't have spares. Saves weight and manufacturing cost
Like 5k
It's like $2k more that what I paid for the 3.
Yes. Somewhere on this thread there is this: https://i.imgur.com/H3siDOf.jpg
[Nada Surf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6tEn90xOE) are time travelers.
In Asia third row will sell like hot cakes. Roads aren‚Äôt designed for huge 3rd row suvs
Great for kids
I have two 25-pound dogs that I put on the seat and attach a harness to the buckled shoulder belt. Since they don‚Äôt need legroom I might get the third row for them... put the kids in the middle row.
"In Canada, the EV rebate program allows cars with 6 or more seats to have a higher MSRP to qualify (55k-60k, whereas 6-seaters must be 45-55k).

Tesla is very likely going to exploit this when they release the SR version of the Y."
Disagree
Are you forgetting about minivans?  We've comfortably fit 7 adults in ours.

"Thing also is this:  Imagine posting an awesome post about exclusive info, then seeing an article about your post on a money generating platform, and then insult to injury, a post outperforming yours about the article about your post.  Can‚Äôt help but have a bit of sour thoughts about the ethic of it. ...yeah."
Guess I'm calling it my power strut from now on.
I would disagree. Just because the strut has a larger diameter doesn't mean it's powered. The Model Y would need a larger strut than the Model 3 due to having to lift the hatch which contains a rear window (more weight) rather than just a trunk lid.
"""Thems some girthy struts, yo!"""
What depreciation?
Same here. Everything comes right off
same.  the white seats have held up better than anything else in the car for us.
"Wow, that video is *really* overproduced. But I guess some people like that."
"Yeah, I tested it before buying just in case, also. That‚Äôs not to say there‚Äôs TONS of extra space, but it‚Äôs feasible with the right seats."
Thats amazing they need to promote this video
She used the work hypothesis wrong
"I dont know.  I bought two of the Diono RXT seats (the thin car seats everyone here recommended last year).  I can't believe you could actually fit 3 of them across the back seat safely.  Following the actual instructions, it would seem impossible to install them correctly if they have to be all forward facing.   And even with those super thin seats, I still can't take my wife and 2 kids to the airport to pick up the grandmother (who's like 4.5 feet tall and 80 pounds).  You just can't install one a carseat in the middle and actually put another carseat on the passenger or driver side.  Model 3 is tiny in the back seat, feels much like a Honda Civic.    


I'm talking from a year's worth of experience with my Model 3, don't buy one  if you want to haul 2+ kids around in carseats and want to have a comfortable experience for you and the front passenger."
"Sure, there are lots of variables when it comes to RF seats because of depth, but width-wise, if 3 car seats can fit, then 3 kids that aren‚Äôt in RF seats (5-10 years old, per OP) can fit width-wise."
"This. We added a Model X to compliment our Model 3 because we have an 11 month old, and another due in April. There‚Äôs no way we can logistically have two rear facing car seats in the Model 3, regardless of make and model of the car seat."
"How tall? Might not have explored all the options. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô1‚Äù and keep the RF behind the drivers seat. And it doesn‚Äôt even touch the seat. 

I picked the shortest depth rear facing I could find. But if you‚Äôre 6‚Äô6‚Äù+ I could imagine this can‚Äôt be fixed."
What's the battery consumption like for overnight camping with AC on? In terms of miles degradation
Being in a car is an entirely different class of camping compared to tent camping. I dont think they are really comparable.
"I have timed 6 minutes to be in drive to be in bed, and vice versa in the morning. Breaking down a wet tent doesn't sound fun. Breaking down a camp in the dark sounds like too much trouble than moving tote boxes around. Gotta beat the sunrise traffic rush (like Lake Moraine, parking lot fills an hour before twilight breaks in the summers)"
So you think teelas are ideal camping cars.   How off road do you get when camping?
Don't get me started on camping. My wife wants to go camping this summer. I don't understand why you want to pretend to be homeless for fun.
[deleted]
"and not getting arrested being drunk and having the keys in the ignition, with engine started."
The part I can‚Äôt get around is not having a shower for the next day. It would just never work for travel for me
Now I'm more confused. Are you sleeping in a garage?
"If you keep an air mattress in the trunk of your Tesla, your planning on sleeping in it."
It would be great for things like attending weekend car races and such.
"Unless you're a newborn that can type, you really should sleep more often! 

Yes, ""unplanned"" I get. On a road trip the later you book a hotel the harder to find a good one still available. Also hard to book after midnight when all websites show for the next evening. So you book one in the afternoon guessing your far you'll get by a reasonable hour. Then the kids stop to piss or the wife gets sidetracked shopping, and instead of reaching the hotel at 10pm I fall asleep at the supercharger at 1am because, you know, is better than sleeping on autopilot.."
I'd rather have the Y but the 3 lays flat in the back and still sleeps great.  I use it to nap at lunchtime every day.
God I wished I had a Tesla during college. Had classes late at night then the next day an early morning class so I didn't have to go home when was a 30 min ride.
I think it's like wearing a prison outfit for Halloween. Sure it sounds like fun unless you've been there. In which case you wonder wtf is wrong with people.
Why would Tesla owners be disproportionately former SUV owners?
... gosh that's creepy
"Even if the rear seat sit any further back from the front seats compared to the Model 3, there will still be more theoretical legroom because of the front seats being on risers.  That will allow tall drivers like me to sit further forward in the cabin, giving more legroom to the rear seats.  This is the reason our TEENY TINY subcompact Bolt EV feels much bigger inside for me and my 2 kids than our Model 3."
Big brain time.
"Yup glad I traded in my bmw for tsla shares last Christmas 
. BMW is doomed."
Do we have numbers or pictures on the exact size of the second row? My son is now 5‚Äô 11‚Äù and my wife is concerned about him having enough legroom in the second row to relax while driving long distances. This is currently the thing blocking a Model y purchase for her.
"Early 3s were tight in the back seat, later ones w redesigned rear seats are (somewhat) better. 

They raised the rear seats and gave it a little more side cushion. Still nowhere near as big as an S."
"Aww bummer!  He previously said the 3 would have air suspension & then backtracked on it:

* [https://electrek.co/2019/08/12/tesla-model-3-air-suspension-elon-musk-cancel/](https://electrek.co/2019/08/12/tesla-model-3-air-suspension-elon-musk-cancel/) 

I suspect this is do to cannibalizing S sales...not as fast the S, no air suspension, no heated steering wheel, no Ludicrous mode, etc.  Although hopefully we'll see Ludicrous mode with the 100kW battery down the road!"
"I feel like the Y is basically the ""Model 3 Hatchback Edition."" As a Model 3 owner, not having a hatch is the only thing I miss on the Model S."
Yes! If they just make this an option we will pick our Y up as soon as they are ready-- or at least as long as they promise it will be something you can do in the service center later in a few months after purchase. We would not use it for hauling trailers either; we have a 'StowAway' container that goes in the hitch and allows us to take a ton of stuff on road trips.
my guess is all manufacturers are doing second row. but good question :)
Ha don‚Äôt we all!
"""I'm fine waiting a year or two for it""

""But I'd like the future to get here in two weeks vs two years""

...doin me a confuse"
"Really the only real rationale for a 3 over a Y is it you want the lower ride/center of gravity, particularly if you opt for the Performance model.  Guessing the Y wont be far off, but the 3 will definitely give you more of a sportscar feel.  Which in my case was up my alley...while the Y will be perfect in the garage as well for my better half to drive and for family trips."
"same for me, really wanted a Model 3, but no hatchback (and no tow hitch) = no sale.  Really hope Tesla NZ will get the tow hitch sorted."
"Yeah, the Model Y actually has **two** hidden storage compartments in the trunk unlike the single compartment in the 3. The Y is going to have considerably more storage space."

How much did you pay for the 3? It‚Äôs about 7000 Canadian difference for me.

My dogs loved the trunk of my CRV which looks about this size. Seems like the seats is a bit of a waste of $$
"No, we are all still... trying to forget.   :)"
i should have mentioned i was excluding those ha. minivans aren‚Äôt exactly that cheap either though.

Musicians can relate.  That's essentially how licensing of music works.
This is what power struts used for motorized trunks look like. It‚Äôs a fairly standard part. Find any SUV with and without one and you‚Äôll immediately see the difference.
"If I try to sell or trade in my 3 now, I won‚Äôt get 72k (Canadian) for it that I bought it for."
I need to call my mom and thank her for not being like that.
IKR.. Comments on the video are apparently turned off for a reason..
"True, but for me, I'm hoping there's way more room in the back of the Model Y compared to Model 3."
Wow two Tesla's? I'm so jelly. I need more money...*cries into empty wallet*
Why not? Someone that sits in the front too tall?
"You're absolutely right on that.  It's the one thing that really infuriates me about our Model 3.  The combined legroom for the driver and the driver side rear passenger seems unusually low.  We had a Chevy Bolt for a year and half before our Model 3, and because of the MUCH higher seating position in that car, it just has much more combined legroom for me and the person behind me.  I sit up high in that car as a driver, with my knees bent like I'm sitting naturally in a chair.  Allows me to sit comfortably forward in the car, giving us plenty of room for the rear passenger carseat for our 1 year old at the time.  

Model 3 it would be impossible.  I really hate how I have to sit so low to the ground and have my legs in such a weird position.  There is literally no way for me to get comfortable in the Model 3 without having my seat as far back as it can go, which then leaves no fucking room for a carseat behind me.  Never had a car like it before and never will again.  Model Y better be more like the Bolt with the taller seating positions."
only 5‚Äô10‚Äù but it definitely touches
It‚Äôs very dependent on outside temps. On a very cold night the heater can pull something like 6kw per hour which could drain a standard battery in about 10 hours if the heater stayed at full blast the whole time. On a mild night with just basic cooling you‚Äôre probably well under 1kw per hour.
You can put a layer of top soil and it's hard to tell the difference.
"Not really. People sleep in tents when car-camping all the time. Sleeping in your car, instead, while it's plugged in at an electrified car-camp/RV park, is pretty nice. And a shit load cheaper than staying the night in the motel down the street."
They were comparing them as different sleeping arrangements. Not saying they are the same type of thing.
That's what they just said.
Sleeping in a car isn't camping IMHO
This is next level missing the point.
"Well I wouldn‚Äôt recommend camping in the middle of a city or on the side of a highway for just that reason, but out in a national park or in a woods with some great hiking can be a pretty awesome experience. There‚Äôs nothing quite like having a few beers around a campfire or waking up with the sun in the middle of nowhere."
She wants to have sex in the car?
So I am going to ask.  Are you serious and do you want a real answer?
Leaving an internal combustion engine idling next to your campsite is less than ideal.
Yeah if you want to die.. sure
"Yeah, and you'll win a nice award! It's called the ""Darwin"""
"Lots of campgrounds have showers, and there are camp showers that you could set up too."
"It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs in a garage or not. Staying in a stopped, running car for long periods of time can still allow carbon monoxide to leak in and be dangerous."
"Planning on having the option available is different than planning on not reaching your final destination. Well, at least in my mind."
It's always nice to have that option for unexpected times. People need to learn to plan ahead.
Or at least bumping uglies in it
You can take the air mattress out of the trunk and use it in someone else‚Äôs house or apartment if they don‚Äôt have a spare bedroom. I‚Äôve done that.
">attending weekend car races

What is this 2005?"
"I don't see what's wrong with planned camping in a Tesla.

Just spent a night in a model x at Zion national Park campground. TT30 adapter gave me a small amount of charge while I blasted the heat all night (in the twenties overnight). Was glorious. Would have been better if they had 50 amp hookups."
Shhh... Just let people do what they want to do.
"I am looking forward to my Mach-E so that I can camp in it. The Model 3's trunk is far too much like what I imagine sleeping in a coffin must be like. But in an SUV I'm excited.

I do a lot of rural trips to places that don't have a lot of hotels nearby and certainly don't have Superchargers. If I'm gonna be going to a campsite to charge the car on 240V, why not camp in the car? Feels more secure than a tent next to the car."
"Who said anything about disproportionate? I said many, not most."
"Yeah once Tesla gets the EU factory up and running on their home turf, they're going to be in trouble."
There is plenty of room for him in the front passenger seat.
"It all depends on your wife and kid's actual dimensions.  This is something I wish I'd been smarter about when buying a Model 3.  I didn't actually try test driving it with our two kids in car seats installed in the back with the wife in the front.  Had i known just how uncomfortably I would have to sit in the driver seat, in order to give my tiny kids room behind me, i never would have bought it.  Was a rushed decision because they were giving $6k discounts on inventory and i had a feeling that would never happen again."
I suspect if anything the TM3 will move down market as improvements in technology get applied. TM3 and Camry sales quantities are almost comparable in certain markets at certain times. Imagine a TM3 with 200 mile range on million mile solid state batteries for $29k US and every supercharger is V3.
"I had a day one reservation for a Model 3 but backed out due to the lack of a hatch. That trunk opening is tiny. I‚Äôm spoiled by the S now. The 3 is more my speed, but I‚Äôm not giving up the hatch."
Question. How does you current Highlander perform on the highway with the stowaway box attached.
"As far as the model 3 goes, I don't think a hitch could be added later. It had to be ordered with it as it's not a thing they can mount after the car is assembled."
I guess we will all find out in a month or so as the cars hit the review blogs. That said I am fascinated to see how much additional space Tesla has been able to add as a result of them being able to move the passenger compartment closer to the front of the car.
I‚Äôd be fine waiting for it had I not already had a Model 3 that will be coming shortly. I suppose I didn‚Äôt word it very well
"> Model Y actually has two hidden storage compartments in the trunk

Do you have any links/pics about this?"
"Cool, thanks!"
Just about $51.5k (USD)
I‚Äôm buying this car so my kids are safer. Last thing I want to do is basically put them in the trunk because a couple seats fit there.
"That‚Äôs what I was thinking, there‚Äôs about a 4 year window that a kid could fit there, out of a booster seat and before too tall, around 9 yo."
"I absolutely adore minivans and the actual utility they provide. Before we ever had kids or even considered having kids, my wife and I bought a minivan for camping and because it could replace a pickup truck for home depot runs. Plus we could take all our friends camping or skiing without having to take multiple cars. Minivans are great. Minivans are fucking cool."
I love how they start with the entire story in the first paragraph (eg ‚ÄúNew photos show the Model Y tailgate for the first time‚Äù) before the next paragraph launches into ‚ÄúMusk first talked about designing a small SUV back in 2008...‚Äù.
You forgot the estimate of useful size between specs and critics say.
I‚Äôm the Midwest United States used ones with 10k miles are $2000 cheaper than new.
"Not sure how the LR variants depreciate, but I look at used SR+ models occasionally, and the prices are ridiculously close to new ones."
You‚Äôre gonna be bummed if you think it‚Äôll be drastically different.
...kw per hour? You mean kWh per hour (kW)?
Thank you. I'm saving up for a M3 but might switch to a Y
Except when you‚Äôre sweating your balls off in the summer.
"Sounds of nature? Crazy winds? Fluctuations in temperature that make you realize you're outdoors and semi-vulnerable? 

Those are things that people want when they go camping!"
Coming Fall 2025: Tesla Topsoil
I'm not putting topsoil in my model 3
And don‚Äôt forget avoiding the motel bed bugs!
"Not really what? I am saying sleeping in a sealed, temperature controlled area (car) is very different than being in a permeable, tent laying on the ground. 

Obviously the car is more ""luxurious"" but many people don't want that when they are camping, they want exposure to nature."
"It‚Äôs car camping. Like a fire engine isn‚Äôt an engine; it‚Äôs a fire engine. And a cow pie isn‚Äôt a pie, certainly not a pie that you would eat, it‚Äôs a cow pie. And yeah car camping is not camping; it‚Äôs car camping. It‚Äôs all good really."
"Yeah.
It's carping!"
"OH, I know it is. Its sarcasm I'm letting roll for all this people with sticks up their asses. But it is true I derive no joy from camping, and its totally a ""homeless simulator""."
"If I were homeless, which I've been there when I was younger, I wouldn't do it in the middle of a city or side of a highway either. In the woods you can find food and bathe in the river get that ""smells like he shit himself.. five days ago ."" off of you. But im sure they're not the best decision makers or they wouldn't be in that predicament."
You have to sleep in the woods with grandma and the kids for that?
"I‚Äôm not talking about campgrounds, I‚Äôm talking about in lieu of a hotel"
It's also ridiculously wasteful.
So it‚Äôs not safe to sleep in a tesla??
I‚Äôm with you. There‚Äôs a difference between planning and being prepared.
"I hear Hector has ordered 12,000 new 21700 batteries for Race Wars"
So wouldn't this be the case for drivers of pretty much any sedan? Idk I don't really see many owners of any other car talking so much about wanting to sleep in their car.
Yeah but that‚Äôs where me or my wife will sit!
"It adds weight if it‚Äôs full, but the way it‚Äôs designed it doesn‚Äôt create any noticeable drag (sits close to tail and has a swing bar to let you get into trunk when parked). So, we‚Äôve had no issues or mileage loss going cross country, on 4 coast-to-coast-and-back trips. Hoping to do the next one on electricity :)"
What‚Äôs the passenger compartment closet?
"I'll try to find the post, but someone saw a Y up close and said one of the Tesla employees told him that. It was posted here a month ago or something. Will update if I can find it, but it was the first I'd heard of it too."
"It's straight up looks like twice the amount of room as what the model x has behind the third-row. It also looks like the whole thing pulls up, and there's likely a second compartment to put stuff in where the third row would normally be."
IIRC the early Model S had the option of two rear facing child seats in the trunk area just because they fit there.
Kids don't care. I'd much rather have sat in a squished 3rd row than in the second row as a kid.
CNBC just shorted the stock.
I mean the cabin heater system can pull 6000 watts... I‚Äôm never 100% sure how the abbreviations are supposed to go.
Except you leave the AC on until it cools off at night so you won‚Äôt sweat all that much
I just wanna make it through the night and wake up somewhere pretty
Those are some things. You can‚Äôt really be this thick as to think they‚Äôre incomparable.
Nah!  It will be boringüòâ
But then you have those people that buy a motorhome to go camping. There are all sorts of ways for all people. Depends on what you want. This is cheaper than a motorhome if you don't camp a lot.
"> Being in a car is an entirely different class of camping compared to tent camping. 

That's what I'm responding to ""not really"" with. In retrospect, I clearly didn't phrase myself well. I meant to say that some people go camping in a tent that's pitched a few yards from their car. You're probably talking about *hiking* and then camping, which I would completely agree is a totally different class of camping. But that's not precisely what you said."
I don‚Äôt see anyone saying these are the same thing.
"yes it‚Äôs other people‚Äôs fault you can‚Äôt write a joke properly

edit: also i love that you're claiming it's ""sarcasm"" but also that everything you said is true"
It seems you're missing the point here.
JFC. You sound so fun.
I know of some people who have a Planet Fitness membership for this reason - free showers nation wide!
Truck stops everywhere. Been to one pay a couple bucks and the restrooms look very nice better than my restrooms at home. They also have laundry mat to wash/dry your clothes for a few more bucks. Cheaper to use a Tesla to sleep/Truck stop showers than hotels. Either this or Planet Fitness membership free showers

"You do know Teslas are electric, right?  They don't burn fuel and create carbon monoxide."
Only in a garage.
"(many) Other cars stink and don‚Äôt have climate control or all night power for whatever you want. There is that. Or they just don‚Äôt have the room (Leaf, etc.)."
"Tesla buyers come from a much wider background of vehicle ownership than other manufacturers experience.

It's the same reason Tesla sees increased sales of sedans while other brands are seeing decreases and killing off their sedan models entirely. People want a Tesla because Tesla, not because they want a sedan."
"I sleep in my outback, but not in my Tesla. When I drive 3 hours to snowboard and don‚Äôt want to drive back that day (3 hour trip each way in good conditions) but don‚Äôt want to pay the minimum of 2 nights lodging I sleep in the outback."
Nice. What brand do you have? Looks like a nice alternative to putting something on the roof.
Edited closet = closer
"My kids care, well 2 of them. I‚Äôm not being argumentative. I‚Äôd love the Y."
"Unlimited supercharging, plug in, set charge to 100% and turn on the heat.  It will never hit 100% because of heater pull thus you avoid the idle charges.  Sleep away. 

It kind of makes you an asshole but it works.  Also not recommended at busy superchargers, it‚Äôs best done overnight when the chance of there being a wait is next to zero."
"I‚Äôm trying to figure out how your comment is relevant. Not everywhere cools off to a reasonable temperature at night. It could be 95 at night while you‚Äôre sleeping in the summer in Texas. This provides A.C. and comfort. What exactly is your argument against that? If you don‚Äôt want to sleep in a car, don‚Äôt, but the conversation is that someone people will, and things like this make it better and more comfortable."
It can't be both?
Obviously more fun than all the downvoters. They must all be homeless. Or enjoy sleeping in a tent outside of Best Buy? IDK.
"They should make an option for camper bed cap for the cybertruck, because that's I'll be getting."
O.o
"https://www.stowaway2.com

They are awesome, my parents use one as well. It‚Äôs weather tight too, so we put our bulky stuff in it (with a lock) when driving cross-country. Also.. we use it locally when doing BBQ events and stuff... holds a ton of food and coolers, etc  :)"
"That‚Äôs the thing though, you only have two. Once you have three someone has to choose between sitting in the middle or having a smaller row to themselves. I know what I would have picked as the youngest!"
Maybe it's how I was raised. I also picked the back row of every classroom üòÇ
Uhhh I was under the impression *you* were arguing against it with your ‚Äúsweating your balls off‚Äù comment. I think sleeping in a car with the AC would be great compared to a tent in the heat.
not if its sarcasm
Right? That'd be awesome. Has it been confirmed whether the bed will have climate control yet?
Maybe they are scared to let you know they care
"The guy I replied to was trying to act like putting a layer on top soil was going to make you as comfortable as sleeping in your car. My position was that it would not, because if it‚Äôs hot I guarantee I‚Äôd be more comfortable than him. That is why I could not understand what you were getting at. We both win, the other guy loses."
Well the back window could roll down. No confirmation yet of that.
"You haven't met my kids haha. There idea of fun is to smash themselves into small baskets to hide from each other. The smaller the space, the more they seem to love it."
"Hahaha okay, we agree to agree. The best kind. I thought that guy meant you could put a layer of topsoil in your car so it‚Äôd be just like camping."
"You know what, you might be right. Maybe I‚Äôm a dumbass. Text on the Internet is hard."
Yeah that was the joke lol
I shouldn‚Äôt reddit while drinking. I‚Äôll leave it all up so other people can laugh at how dumb I am. Lol
390mi! So close to that magic 4-0-0.
"Elon: ""All S/X cars made in recent months have actually been above stated EPA range. Will be unlocked soon for free via software update.""

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1228541579679322112?s=19"
Big question is what are the actual hardware differences between them. Very curious and so close to 400 and then onto 420!
"TLDR


Model S: 373 --> 390mi estimated range

Model X: 328 --> 351mi estimated range"
"I thought it might just be from the new rims but when I go to the Model X page it has slipstreams and a bigger % increase.

S - 373 to 390 is 4.5%

X - 328 to 351 is 6.8%

It can't just be rims (though that could be part of it), there has to be something else too."
"That's a 4.5% lift from 2019.  Looking at the data (not looking at pack size but simply the most range that you can get in a model S it looks like it increases about 5-10% in recent years. 

2017 - 6.35%  
2018 - 0%  
2019 - 11%  
2020 - 4.5%

Projecting this to next year and we'll be at 410 with no issues. If the maxwell tech provides a larger boost it could be even greater."
Wireless charging is now listed on interior options.
I'm curious if this is an actual hardware change or if it's just updated EPA numbers?
"Those new [19"" Tempest wheels](tesla new tempest wheels https://imgur.com/gallery/hc81SKF) are probably a boost. They look much more ""aero"" than anything I've seen on an S.

Edit: Someone posted the old range was 375, so it went up less than 4% to 390. Could aero wheels be the only big change? I've heard they add 3-5% on the Model 3."
Anyone wanna beer me about 95K?
"What was the range before? Also how did they manage that? Has to do with battery tech I assume, but is it in the chemical composition, did they shove more batteries in the same space?"
"This is awesome. 

One question that I have though, as a 2017 Model X owner. My X gets about 65% on average of real miles compared to what the gauge says. So if I have 200 miles, I get 130 a max. That's even in chill mode and not using ludicrous. 

Is my battery just old and doesn't hold up well? Would the 390 estimates give you 300+ miles of real life driving? Or even road tripping?

Just curious, not complaining, I don't see how I could ever have another vehicle."
Fuckers lol I get my 2nd X tomorrow
Is there a difference with the ‚Äúplus‚Äù?
Wait for Plaid!
Awesome car for $80k.  I wish they still had the retractable sunroof and 3rd row :(
Not a fan of those new base wheels. Reminds me of a mid 90s Tercel.
"I assume this is with new new rims. 

It shows the same range for all 3 rims/tire options which is not true"
"So does this mean we are gonna start seeing longer range models in the near future? I'm expected to take deliver of a M3P, should I wait it out?"
*Cries in 295mi MX*
"They‚Äôve been calling the 100D Non Raven ‚ÄúLong Range‚Äù on the CPO site for a few months now. 
My guess is they‚Äôll push an update for the Ravens to reflect this ‚ÄúLong Range Plus‚Äù range and then leave the 100D as the normal ‚ÄúLong Range‚Äù."
Has charging speed been improved?
Did they low key bring back unlimited free supercharging too?! I noticed this in the c c shucks builder.
"Well and free unlimited supercharging with model s, is that new too?"
The 40kWh Model S had 139 miles of range and now we're up to 390 miles!!
Damn. I just purchased at the end of December. Any chance this is  a software update and I'll get the added range too?
And free unlimited supercharging
I am looking at the cost-benefit of a model S over 3 and the S is looking more attractive...
Wait for 420 range with 69 mins charging time
"My wish for a 250 mile all weather range Tesla costing around $50k(not a truck, but a CUV)  price point is getting closer. I predict 2023 will be the year and I can't wait to get into one."
"IMO theres been an increase in energy for the extended range, which is why we have the 'plus' given they've really worked the efficiency hard already"
"OK, here's a conundrum‚Ä¶  I recently placed my order for a new Model S Long Range.  Last IM that I got said it's 3-6 weeks out.  I wonder if I'll get the LR, or will I get the LR+?"

Just paid off the Model 3...this is so tempting. It's so beautiful and that dash screen. UGH
They need to just make it 400 already... it would get a lot of press.
When will we get 420 range secured?
"Dang it, I‚Äôm due for delivery of a 2019 demo model next week (1300 miles on it).  Based on this tweet I‚Äôm guessing it is only the 2020 models getting this.  Yet I was told up down and sideways there was zero difference between the 2020 and 2019 models.

I‚Äôm not expecting to get this upgrade.  So now I‚Äôm a little disappointed.  I don‚Äôt think It‚Äôs worth backing out of my order because I did get a 5k discount, but I would have chosen full price and the 2020 mode had I known about this...."
"Woah, are they doing the same for model 3??? That bump in range is pretty big!"
What're the chances this drops prices on used Ravens?
I don't get why they have to call it the Plus if they remove the Long range option.
So would you get a pd3 with acceleration  or long range model s?
"Wow almost 400 miles is impressive, don't like the new standard wheels though, the styling isn't as good as the other options"
We officially have 105 miles more than the 2012 Model S now. It came out with 285 miles of rated range.
So is this a battery improvement or are they limiting the range via software?
"I ordered my Tesla MX December 26th and received a VIN 2 weeks ago. I‚Äôm taking delivery next week. Does this mean I have the 350 mile range? I only ordered the long range but see there is the long range plus now, does that mean mine will be a long range plus?"
"I know it was gonna be a Model 3 variant, I wasn‚Äôt implying there will be Model S in that price range - didn‚Äôt know about the calling in thing as I didn‚Äôt see it on the website . Thanks for the info !"
So what about the Roadster?
"Did Full Self Driving also become less expensive at $7,000? Wasn‚Äôt it $8,000 before? Or am I suffering a memory lapse?"
Was wondering what to spend some of my TSLA options profits on :)
"Please make a 420mi range before the summer, i wanna upgrade"
I have a Model X Performance - September...... I hope the upgrade is for my Raven as well...!
My wallet: LOL
so will my Model X Long Range (328mi.) go up to 351mi? or is this just for people who buy the Model X now? Tesla updates are so confusing to me ü•¥
GOD
"Does this apply to older models? OR as it said only ones developed in past few months? How do you know when a model was made when shopping for one?

Thanks."
It kind of sucks that they don‚Äôt make the turbine wheels in just plain silver. Some people don‚Äôt want carbon.
Nice that‚Äôs awesome
I honestly wonder if we'll just see a faster dropping miles remaining indicator unless you're drinking extremely conservatively.
How long before people start tweeting to Elon asking if they can upgrade their battery pack
Is this drivetrain still called Raven?
"Hmm, I bought the Raven Model X when it was first released. I was in the middle of my preraven build when I switched. I don‚Äôt think mines included in that few month window haha"
Man I‚Äôll be honest I am a model 3 and y guy and haven‚Äôt looked at the s in a long time but now that the miles are creeping up and they added back the u limited supercharging it might change my mind. I like the simplicity better of the newer models because that strokes my idea of where cars are going in years to come but man it would be nice to charge once a week every week and not just most weeks.
I don‚Äôt like new stock wheels.
I‚Äôm waiting for a 450-500+ range S or X.
dammit! I just took delivery of my MX LR on January 16! :/
390 Miles for 79k! 74k after incentives.  Thats a deal.
"I really really hate that the price, is based on incentives. WTH. That‚Äôs some crappy shit."
So is Tesla gonna have a complete redesign of the S and X? The S is definitely long in the tooth at this point.
Love the range.. hate the pricetag..
"This is nice, but we are really looking forward to the 3 LR+. Should be close to 300 too!

EDIT: Should have said ""Should be close to 400 too!""."
Can‚Äôt tell the max charge is rate.  V3 comparable surely.
But can we order the Qi center console charger yet?
Damn.. I just bought model s in December. This sucks for me.
Just give us full self driving please
why the fuck is this done when the market is closed? :D
Will there be a significant price reduction? Their cars are too expensive.
They look stupid
"cars have a mileage paywall.

Rad"
"Taycan runs N√ºrburgring and sets a quick time; Tesla responds with Laguna Seca and an unofficial unknown over hyped N√ºrburgring time.

Taycan is basically quicker than the Model S Performance; Elon responds by claiming to raise the Model S power by 50hp, which never happened.

Taycan is seen to be more efficient than the Model S; Tesla responds by randomly raising the range.

Tesla is threatened by the Taycan."
$10 says the next update will take it to 420.
Can already achieve 400 now.  I've gotten 332 miles with my 310-mile Performance Model 3 by averaging like 226 wh/m.  It's quite easy really.  slow acceleration with stop and go driving with a speed limit of up to around 55mph
And here I am tottering about in my Leaf 24kwh...
You mean the magic 4-2-0
"My money is on Semi R&D trickling down to the cars. We‚Äôll see 400 soon enough. Granted it‚Äôll be a $95k car, but still."
If it's like my m3 sr+ that means it'll get ~240mi actual.
420? That magic number
"If CT and Roadster can get away with no side view mirror, expect S3XY to get the same treatment.

Elon said at highway speed the side mirror acts as an airbrake and costs you ~5% range."
And that's why there's never a wrong time to buy in
"What are these EPA numbers anyways /s

My 3P has dropped down to 285mi and will actually do about 70% of that range so I can rely on 200mi. Looking at 1yr and 15kmi.

I think this looks quite representative of real use. You should be looking at retaining 2/3 of range to rely on assuming 100-0% battery usage. Add a buffer of 20% so 90-10% and a lightly used 3P will give you 160mi that you can depend on every day."
[deleted]
"I wonder if the motors are the same as the performance, like how the 3 AWD is software limited."
"It‚Äôs likely the same as the Raven update but with small software tweaks to get a bit more range. Obvious places where they can improve the cars to get more range are the battery pack weight which is planned to increase energy density (decrease weight for the same capacity) shortly by using less materials to hold the cells, both motors switch to PM when now only the front motor is PM while the other is induction which is heavier per kW of power and likely uses the less efficient and heavier IGBTs compared to the lighter inverter for the front motor like the Model 3 namely made from Si carbide. They could also decrease weight from the chassis when they make the Plaid upgrade to host one additional motor and a larger battery capacity has been announced for that drivetrain."
Looks like new aero wheels?  Or have those been there?
"Probably we‚Äôll never find out, like when they increased Model 3 range to 322mi some weeks ago."
Nice
[deleted]
"For the Antipodeans who struggle with miles:

Model S: 600 --> 628km estimated range

Model X: 528 --> 565km estimated range"
"Elon wasn't kidding at the Q4 call he said that they had a Model S at almost 400 miles now.  Dont think anyone expected it this soon.

In other news Lucid is claiming the Air will get 400 miles in real world (not EPA cycle) driving with a smaller pack.  Color me skeptical."
That‚Äôs a great deal for 80k. 390 miles AND 3.7s 0-60
"TLDR - Metric:

Model S: 600 ‚Äî> 627km estimated range

Model X: 527 ‚Äî> 564km estimated range"
is there new technology in the battery to make it charge faster? Or just a bigger battery?
Real range: 277 miles
390 miles is 339 nautical miles. You‚Äôre welcome.
"They were down playing the range before, Elon said it was more like 380, so 10 mile boost from actual EPA number + aero seems likely."
"Cool info. Looks like it‚Äôs just under a 5% increase year over year since 2012. Starting at 270 miles in 2012 to 390 miles in 2020. If it were a flat 5%, we should be at 399 miles this year."
‚ÄúMoDeL s/X rEfReSh‚Äù
*parks over a massive wireless charger*
Added aero wheels and I think also tweaked EPA numbers.
He said a few hardware changes have been implemented over the last couple of week to make it possible
">	They look much more ‚Äúaero‚Äù than anything I‚Äôve seen on an S.

*[sad areo wheel noises](https://i.imgur.com/vQNHJoZ.jpg)*"
"When you change the wheels, range doesn‚Äôt go down on the webisite, so I doubt it‚Äôs only the aero wheels adding range."
"Those white/grey wheels do not look good.

When they leaked these wheels a while back they looked like a darker color and it looked better.

I currently have 19‚Äù wheels on my 19 model s performance - am I operating at max efficiency or is there a different wheel I could be using that would be better?
Possibly. They‚Äôre hideous though. I‚Äôm not a fan of the new fake silver rims look either on the S or Y. Maybe the rims underneath look better than the 3s. I prefer the 3‚Äôs aerowheels.
You only want a base model?
"373 S

328 X"
373 for S
Software based efficiency gains just like what they did with the Model 3
"How fast do you drive?

In my experience setting the cruise control on 60 MPH will get me right about the rated range.  Setting it on 75 MPH (the speed limit on most highways where I live) gets about ‚Öî of the rated range.  That should be pretty normal for most EVs, it‚Äôs just the laws of aerodynamics."
"It‚Äôs heavily condition dependent. I just finished 3000 mi on 2020 X with supposed 305 range. In practice it varied from 240-400.  Speed (5mph over) dropped it to 270, rain/cold did too. And obviously mountains and launches changed it. I also noticed it took 30 minutes each day for regen to fully kick in."
"Most people won‚Äôt admit the EPA rating is super conservative and not realistic in most cases. Similar results on my model 3. I drive it as I do my ICE vehicle, and get about 60-70 percent of the displayed range too."
"Climate control is a battery hog, definitely heat more so than AC.

If you can get by with just seat warmers on, use that since it‚Äôs noticeably more efficient than the cabin heat/fan.

You can also set the temp to not as low/high and manually fan speed to 1. Won‚Äôt be as efficient as turning it off by disabling AC helps.

Going 5-15 over 55/60 mph with climate control on will definitely hurt your mileage.

For myself I can grin and bear it but with the ladies... well you know."
I'd like to know also. I've been working on getting my buddy into a used X for over a year. Don't want him to get one only to have it not be enough for him. His wife drives kids around a lot everyday.
Prob need to reset the battery by letting it get down to 10% or 5% and doing a full charge 2-3 cycles. Are you using any other features when the care is idle? I notice the battery drain if it's cold and use preheat and also if sentry mode is constantly on.
"Doubtful your battery has huge degradation. Could just be if you have large wheels (like 19's are much better for range than 21's...), or if you're going 65+ mph often or not (Teslas have better efficiency at slower speeds). Plus if you're just going somewhere up an incline or depending on the weather, the range is obviously getting reduced. All that stuff factors in. 2/3rds expected range on a daily basis is kinda bad though. Maybe what it tells you you have left is just inaccurate too..."
Cold weather?
Degradation will reduce the displayed range (instrument cluster) for a given state of charge. Actual range (corrected for your recent usage over the past ~30 miles) is reflected in the trip estimate when using nav.
Probably just a software change from new EPA numbers or the new tempest rims. You may be able to get those numbers too.
His follow up tweet does say that recent made S and X will get the new range via free software upgrade.
"You‚Äôll ha e the hardware changes, they are unlocking on recent cars with software update"
"You‚Äôll get it, he also tweeted all S/X delivered in last few months will get it via software update."
"
@elonmusk

Many small hardware improvements throughout the car that have been introduced gradually over past several months"
Not too late to cancel
Got 7 days to return
thats what you get for buying 2 of the exact same car
My guess is it's the EPA rating that Elon was talking about during the earnings call. Probably nothing different hardware wise. Just software based efficiency gains.

"Lack of sunroof has definitely cost them an upgrade sale from me. Since they don't have the sunroof _or_ an updated interior from my 2015 pre-facelift, it's hard to justify upgrading my nearly 5-year-old car. I think that's bizarre."
"I thought the sunroof was a big deal when I bought mine but I almost never use it. I won't miss it too much.

Will be upgrading my 2016 (just post facelift) S as soon as there is an interior refresh. Looking forward to the new range (I only have 235 or so now) but willing to hold out until there's some updates otherwise."
I thought the sunroof was an option if you ordered in-store?
"I don't think so.  Not immediately anyway, especially on the 3. The S and X are their premium vehicles, and they're going to do things to keep them at the top of the chain.  I look for the 3 to be maxed out around 340-350 miles of range.  This is well beyond what the majority of drivers need on a daily basis, and more range means added cost to the consumer.

That said, in 4-5 years, who knows.  So, if you buy a M3P, when you're done paying on the loan (if you use a loan), it will be time for a new one anyway."
Been like that for a month or so. Not sure on the change
"I hope they drop that. It's unsustainable.  

I know S owners who exclusively supercharge at ones by their house ""because it's free"". This makes waits longer for folks who need it on trips."
Elon said all S&X purches in the past few months have this.
"Hard to say 

‚ÄúMany small hardware improvements throughout the car that have been introduced gradually over past several months‚Äù"
I mean it's only $40k more...
"Have you not seen Model Y?

https://www.tesla.com/modely/design#battery"
Elon already said in earnings call that it was listed lower than actual.
"OK looks like I'm wrong, more efficiency lots of small changes adding up"
"Musk just tweeted all S/X delivered in last few months will get it, so you‚Äôre golden."
"Your choice.  There is a 7 day refund period after delivery, so if they haven‚Äôt already made plans to deliver you the LR+, you can request it."
"I have one on order too.  I logged into the website and edited my order to be Long Range Plus. I figure if it's just a software update it won't delay delivery, but if it's more than that I'll get the latest car with a bit of a delay. The change did not affect the price."
"In the comments, there's a tweet from Elon stating that there will be updates to already purchased vehicles."
"I hope we see an update soon, holding out buying one until the next upgrade."
Don‚Äôt think it will unfortunately.
"Epa paperwork, had to be called something else"
Model 3 charges faster (miles/minute of supercharging) so it's still faster for road trips.
"Genuinely asking just got mine priced to upgrade but this is close for a few more grand for the long range. Obv, need to do more research. Thoughts?"
"285. How?, electric cars were just glorified golf carts back then right?"
"My hunch is that they changed the battery chemistry a while back,  but software locked it to the same range as the ones built the day before. Then they announce this higher range a couple of months later.  That way no one complains about the one they bought just the day before having worse range; instead, they see themselves as lucky they have one with s free upgrade."
"Musk said this is a software unlock,  so all S/X made for the last few months get it."
"If you recently purchased yours, Elon said that updates will be coming because they are getting better than expected range."
Sounds like Elon's got you covered. Recent months included.
"""All S/X cars made in recent months have actually been above stated EPA range. Will be unlocked soon for free via software update."" Via elons twitter"
"At the bottom of the screen, it shows the price without incentives.  I hate it too, but I can see why they do it."
LR is 310 already since the beginning.
"It's still a little nutty.  See: ""phantom braking"""
Compare them to competitors and you'll quickly see that Teslas offer quite a bit more range and performance for a much lower price.
The Laguna Seca has video evidence of the lap just like the Taycan is unofficial with a pre production car but it‚Äôs no question that the production Taycan is a lot better for track performance than the current Model S and charges faster. As for efficiency being better with the Taycan is up for debate. Under no official range test did they score above 500 km that was promissed in 2015 and if the car is truelly capable nothing stops them from getting those official ratings. Tesla increasing range is an expectation there is nothing random about it. Until everyone is fine with the range they won‚Äôt stop improving it and no doubt a lot of people still want more range and shorter charging time before buying an EV from anybody.
Will it take 69 minutes for a full charge too?
When they finally reach a 420 mile range I wonder if they'll start offering green as a paint option.

"Fine, I‚Äôll give you an upvote."
"Paid upgrade but yeah

I don‚Äôt know how you have the discipline.
"What would be really cool is if Tesla utilized wind direction data to give you a ""highest efficiency route"" on maps.

Emable you to cruise on that sweet tailwind as much as possible.

Local weather wind direction would already be very accurate in someplace like the SF Bay Area or Seattle with their thousands of weather stations."
"332 on a Performance model is really impressive, though as you note, you have to stick to slow, sub-highway speeds to achieve it.

A big difference is that the Model 3, especially RWD models, achieve slightly better efficiency than advertised, while the Model S achieves slightly worse efficiency than advertised.  Prior to this, the real-world mileage on a ""370-mile"" Model S was only a few miles more than a ""325-mile"" Model 3 LR RWD. While it hasn't been updated for the new ""Long Range Plus,"" you can find a good per-configuration comparison here: [https://teslike.com/range/](https://teslike.com/range/) (I also don't think this comparison has been updated to account for the efficiency upgrades that have been rolled out via software updated).

&#x200B;

It's hard to know what the new 390 mile range really means, since Tesla has a history of exaggerating mileage on the Model S trims."
Meanwhile I‚Äôm seeing around 325 just cruising town in the winter.
I have a 2020 M3P and I‚Äôm getting terrible efficiency. Mostly around 60-70% with a max charge of 290 down from the 310 a month ago.  I am in NY and if the heat is off I get like 70-80 percent driving normal with all the tricks on. If heat is on it‚Äôs like 40-60 percent. Help... is this normal?
P3D- with 18‚Äù Aeros I‚Äôm guessing?
"Yeah same, plus on nice 70 degree days, turn the AC off and just use the fan on like 2-3 setting, that‚Äôs instant 220 whammis.  Plus I love playing the tiny green bar game, where you see how far you can coast on minima regen up to stop light etc.."
"I have 257 for the 19k miles I have on my car, is that good? I‚Äôm still confused by these numbers"
how are you getitng 226? I get 320 on a lr with 20s. And 280 with 19s
"Hi Jason Bourne. My lifetime was 220 wh/m for the first 15k miles.

Then winter came."
"Stealth?

I've *never* seen sub-230, ever, even on long trips."
It can achieve 700 miles now but not in EPA tests.  Hypermiling always goes farther
Model 3 trickled up pal. Semi uses something like 4 model 3 battery packs.
Right before the plaid release would be the wrong time to buy in
That's not true. Getting a car right before the MCU2 upgrade would have been unfortunate.
"If you mean it dropped from the range of was doing originally by 15%, that is likely due to winter. I've had several Teslas and none dropped more than 5% after up to 6 years.
If you mean that is 15% actual range compared to EPA range, then yes, that is the norm (not only for EVs)."
You are wrong. He has since tweeted that there are hardware changed to cars made after November.
so the same exact battery? I don't know I got my model S last month and I never even saw it display 370 even at 100% battery. My highest is 365.
[deleted]
"Hey, I‚Äôm also 10 feet tall, 897 lbs and can bench press a semi truck, just don‚Äôt verify it okay?"
"For the S and X? No, it's well documented that the performance models have a larger rear motor. There's two rear motor types, small and large. Small is used in the AWD non performance cars. Large is used in the Performance cars and the RWD cars."
I heard somewhere on here that this actually stopped being the case around April 2019. Not sure if it‚Äôs true but would love to hear if anyone else had info on that since I only saw it a couple days ago
The model 3 AWD and Performance don‚Äôt have the same motors. It‚Äôs not a software lock
It just wasn't funny.

"What is the difference between the ways each region measure range/efficiency. 

Before the update to model X and S 

A model S would go 713km or 443miles in AUS. 

Model S in the USA does 390miles Est. 627km...

That is a massive difference!!!"
"The Model S LR appears as ""610km (WLTP)"" in my configurator."
"Tbh it's EPA miles, not imperial miles. There's a bunch a of weightings and conditions so how EPA miles relate to kilometers or real world miles is hard to say. 

I would just see it as it's own unit."
What about the performance models ?
you da real MVP
I trust exactly zero of the marketing numbers from other EV manufacturers until they have actual retail cars in the wild.
By all prior reports the lucid will have a 130kwh battery
I can‚Äôt wait for the cybertruck 500+ miles and <2.9 sec for 70k.... take my damn money Elon (but if the stock can keep going up for a bit I‚Äôd love it as i dropped 10k into it at 260 as a pre down payment- I‚Äôm up to the stock financing about half the truck- if it finances it all I‚Äôll love Elon even more
80K for that range and speed? That's a hell of a lot of money bro....
has it always been 3.7s or did it just get upgraded?
"With a less than 5% increase, it‚Äôs almost certainly some software tweak, not a new battery."
The actual chart is very lumpy because sometimes the packs change size and sometimes the cars switch from RWD to AWD and that throws off the efficiency gains.  It does appear that the gains are slowing down but it also seems that Tesla has a bigger battery-gain push every two years.
It‚Äôs coming.
"The EPA range in the configurator is an estimate, which means they're not official EPA numbers yet - just the expected result."
Oh god my eyes

"We know that changing wheels affects the range on the Model 3 but it doesn't reflect that on the site when you choose the 19"" wheel option. The displayed EPA rating is for the default configuration.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure of the details but the EPA does not require you to provide different ratings for all accessories and optional configurations."
"Good question, that I don't know the answer to exactly. However, If you don't have an ""aero"" cover of some type, then you're certainly not getting the best range you could. Here's a [Car and Driver article ](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30169467/tesla-model-3s-aero-wheel-covers-efficiency-test/)comparing aero vs non-aero on the Model 3. They showed an average of 3.4% improvement across various speeds, or up to 10 additional miles.

I don't know if 18 or smaller wheels would be even better. I'm pretty sure larger wheels are generally worse, but I don't know where the sweet spot is."
How tf did they boost the X even more than S with same wheels??
"390 S
351 X"
I think some of these efficiency gains were questionable üßê
"I go 68-70. But on long road trips, sometimes I‚Äôll go 80 and beat it down to close to empty (never to close obv) so that I spend more time charging at 380+ and not at 150. 

But i hear you on the laws, it‚Äôs the biggest draw back of owning a Tesla for me."
"I know it‚Äôs not the same, but with climate control off on the model 3 LR RWD i can go 72 MAYBE 75 and get rated range. I don‚Äôt think 	awd will at those speeds, but rwd is more efficient."
Regen doesn't work in the top few percent of battery capacity.
"I get the same values on daily drives.  The thing that everyone is not mentioning is that Tesla‚Äôs use power when you sleep, when you work, etc..  so really, during the week your 250 range becomes 160 with the less good mileage in town and all the wasted electrons.


When doing a road trip, I get much closer to the  published range."
Same. I can do seat warmer on 2-3 and short bursts of climate to take the chill out of the air / defog and get around 275-285 for a 45 mile commute. If my wife is with me it‚Äôs seat warmer on 3 and heat on 78 and 6 speed. She drove home last night and average wh/mi was 368. Was 415 until we drove the last 8-10 mins at slower speeds.
"Why would you set the fan speed to 1?  The fan motor isn't a big hog, the heater unit is.  If I have the heater running, I want the fan speed up so I'm not wasting energy at the heater."
I‚Äôm very curious to see if the size of the Y makes it more functional battery wise than the X. It would make me consider dropping down in size.
"One cycle will be fine, but top it off all the way, and let it balance itself, which takes another hour or so on top of a 100% charge.  This isn't a bad idea to do every few months to prevent growing inaccuracy in battery measurements.

Also, HVAC!"
"If his displayed (cluster) range was still as expected then a ‚Äòreset‚Äô of the BMS is not necessary, since it already has the correct full pack capacity figured out. If the actual range is lower then that it typically due to the Wh/mi being higher than rated due to driving style, speed, heat use, etc."
My other one was totaled by a deer
"Honestly that's so boring lol...Never ubdsrstood people who bought two of the same car.

Lots of people do that here in CA though with their Toyota Camry's and Honda Accords...like...ugghhh."
"Are they gaming the test used to determine EPA range, just like GPU manufacturers make drivers optimized for benchmarks?"
"Yes, but this is like one of those cringey things your weird uncle would post on a Facebook meme that your grandma shared."
It has to be funny to be considered humour
You posted the same thing multiple times...
That and model X and S customers don‚Äôt seem to be priority anymore.
"Thanks for your reply. It's going to be the first ever batch of model 3s being delivered to where I am, Dubai."
S/X have had free supercharging (again) since September at least. I wonder if it will last. I saw few model 3s on my recent road trip at superchargers
I missed that in the original tweet but saw it now. Looks like some of us will get it.
Right? Plus free gas for life!
guh...the y is $72000 Canadian from teala....but $46000 us is only 60000 canadian in straight conversation of funds...wtf
"Does model Y do 250 all weather miles on highway? That's what I was referring to. I do not care much about the overall range, but want a consistent rage which gives at least 3 hours of highway driving in mid west winters. Tesla is not there yet with model Y, but by in about a couple of years, that will be a reality."
Lovely!  Thanks!
"I‚Äôm not going to sweat over it.  It‚Äôs barely more than a rounding error.

I also noticed the base wheels have changed‚Ä¶  I wonder if that was for some slight aero improvement?"
"Edited your order?  Is that possible?

When I go into my account, it has an option to ‚ÄúView Design Details‚Äù, which brings up all the build details and options I selected, and there is a note at the bottom saying, ‚ÄúIf you would like to make a change, it may affect your delivery date, and may be subject to a fee.‚Äù  But there‚Äôs nothing showing *how or where* to make a change, even if I wanted to."
Yes for recent builds.  Maybe I‚Äôll get lucky and my 2019 will qualify as recent but they started 2020 sales in October (I think).  So I‚Äôm not holding my breath.  It sounds like it was a HW change too.
"Think that is the confusing part, when is the cut off date. What production month."
"Same. I waiting for Standard Range Plus to have like \~280 miles. I'm buying it for myself as a graduation present so I have a year and a half to wait. 

.\_."
I don't get this is not a hardware change right? Don't think you gain anything by waiting unless I am really missing something here.
Teslas getting better for the new ones always drop the price of used. May not be a big drop in this case tho.
purchased in november! hope that is recent enough üò¨ü§ûüèº
Ooh! Thanks for sharing that!
"LOL, your comment was so confusing to me until I realized my typo. I meant 400. :)"

">The Laguna Seca has video evidence of the lap just like the Taycan is unofficial with a pre production car but it‚Äôs no question that the production Taycan is a lot better for track performance than the current Model S and charges faster.

There is a huge difference between the cars. While the Taycan was preproduction, it was more of a development car which is representative of their production vehicle. The only thing different it had was a roll cage for safety. The Model S on the other hand was a fully gutted prototype with their Plaid drive. It was an experiment car, not to mention that the car was running semi slicks vs the Taycan summer tire. The cars cannot be compared to each other.

>As for efficiency being better with the Taycan is up for debate.

The Taycan is geared for the performance aspect. It has stickier, larger, heavier tires than what is on the Model S that achieves their long range. It has been shown and stated many times that the Model S with it's most aggressive tire setup gets less than 250 mile range. The Taycan still has a more aggressive tire setup than the most aggressive Model S setup, has a smaller usable battery by 12kWh and manages to be less than 20 miles off the Model S range. That is pointing to a more efficient vehicle."
"Marketing will be like ""and you can charge it for 69 minutes, although a full charge will take longer"""
"The next one will be the Model XXX and will offer a special 69D. It'll also *grow* to 69"" tall."

"Oh, I don't.  I'm averaging 284 wh/m since getting the car.  I LOVE to open it up, daily.  But, on my way to N/C, I mostly take back roads...and, slow down quite a bit.  So, i tried to get the best range I could...and achieved it."

What is your wh/m for life of vehicle?
No. 19s. P3D+
"75 kwh battery.

"I averaged 226 watts per mile on a trip with backroads to North Carolina.

320 wh/m is terrible.  That's a 234 mile range."
"I can get 220 without really trying in summer.  Winter closer to 280 yes but that's cold battery, heating, etc.

Not sure what causes the massive variation - I talked with one guy who was having trouble getting below 300.. driving style, but he insisted he wasn't pushing it."
"Considering your name defaults to not believing, makes sense. I averaged that over 400 miles on my way thru us 301...no heat...hypermiling.  for fun. I'll have to find the screensnap"
"Full performance with 19"" wheels."
"Spring/fall, no hvac, traffic, in a M3 LR RWD will get you sub 200 easy."
Quite a difference huh? I achieve mine by normal driving. My point was 390 to 400 is less than 3%.
4 model 3 motors actually. Little is known about the battery
Motors.   The prototype LR semi  uses like 10 model S packs
Yeah but plaid will likely be an option. I doubt every car will be plaid equipped.
"My P100D X was built March 2018 and has MCU1. Must have been one of the last ones with MCU1. Bought it as a new demo inventory car this past summer and went ahead after seeing Elons tweets that there would be an upgrade which now makes me feel like a sucker as it seems to be a false promise. Love the car, avoid using the touchscreen at all costs because of the lagfest."
"I did that (Fully loaded Model X P90DL). Still do not regret it, it was an awesome car, but if it has AP2 I would have kept it for a few more years."
"Not sure sure where you got 15%. My reported range loss is 8.5%. That's taken from the stats on TeslaFi.

The rest are my calculations for real world range I get with mild weather. I'm not complaining, just pointing out that whatever the EPA numbers are, they aren't much to be excited about.

I should add tires are 245 20s."

"Unlocked soon via software update, according to Musk."
The range of a P X is still 305. If it‚Äôs a software change why wouldn‚Äôt P go up too?
"It stopped being the case long before that, thats when they just started differentiating it on EPC due to right-to-repair laws in MA or something. They started making the non-P Model S with smaller inverters on the rear motor in august 2015 when they release the 90kwh battery. Before that, the front motors were always ""smalls"" and the rears were always ""large"" (tesla internal terms, not mine). After that, almost every awd non-p has small inverters.

RWD S' are all large units, and just software locked in a sense. If you replace the bootloader of the FPGAs in the large motors (which regardless of what people might say, is possible over UDS) and then set the gateway config to identify as a performance version, they will accept and morph the car into a Performance or Performance+ car if you redeploy the firmware.

Almost bricked a car a couple months ago by manually flashing all the applicable ECUs (including the FPGA fw) except for the FPGA bootloader with the performance firmwares. Luckily we caught on to it before the car went into deep sleep or we restarted everything and were able to revert back. Turns out, the FPGA bootloader has an assert that checks if the firmware version matches the bootloader, and if it does not.. it halts. So any large unit with mismatched firmwares become useless since you can't reflash them after a power cycle.

All that said, if a little birdy dropped a link to the P version of the FPGA bootloader into my inbox... it would be greatly appreciated!"
"The part is supposedly different, but it was software limited, with acceleration being proof. So who the fuck knows :)"
Wouldn‚Äôt this show up in the curb weight stat? Last I looked the weight between AWD and performance model 3s were the same
"Elon also just announced that S/X buyers of the last couple of months will get an up to 5-7% range upgrade via an OTA update, **for free**:

On another note, it‚Äôs good to see the masses start to question EV pricing nowadays."
I paid 74k for my s75d ap1 in late 2016. Granted I got the 7500 fed rebate
Not too bad considering the model 3 performance is around 60k (66k including tax in CA) for only 300 miles range and a significantly dumbed down interior.
"80 k ... man I wash I could afford that baby mortgage
Payment on top of my actual mortgage payment . So the $35,000 Tesla ain‚Äôt coming out anytime Soon or was that never a thing."
Unchanged
What‚Äôs also crazy to think about is that the same battery pack got 335 miles this time last year. Somehow they‚Äôve squeezed an extra 55 miles out of the same battery!
I would get those wheels in a second
OG wheel option for the Model S.
I think you guys might have nailed it. its a 4.8% improvement vs a 2020 raven and Aero wheels give the model 3 a 3.5ish improvement. A better wheel + some tweaks to software can definitely do a 4.8% improvement and software tweaks won't change the EPA estimate until an updated model is release.
"It's been a while since I looked at it, but I believe the car doesn't have to be re-rated if the fuel economy impact is <10% and <25% of people purchase that option."
"sit behind a truck on long trips and you will get 115+% efficiency. If I do that for a 500 mile trip on my raven, I can skip an entire SuC session. CT -> Ohio in just 2 stops for a total of under 35 minutes. (~ 240 wh/mi)."
"We get >10% improvement over rated efficiency in our 3 LR AWD @ 72mph. It doesn't use the front motor unless you're accelerating modestly. 

In summer. In winter it's more like a minimum 20% reduction compared to the rating, if not worse."
"I would start each day with 70%. It appeared to have more to do with cold, though not extreme cold (40)"
"That‚Äôs why they recommend to plug in nightly, which reduces the depth of cycles on the pack while also allowing it to be conditioned prior to drives, which increases range since colder cells are less efficient."
Good point I suppose. I‚Äôll have to test the usage stats there.
The y is kinda small though as a family car.
oh ok
"I didn‚Äôt buy two, the first was totaled on Dec 28th, I hit a deer At 75mph exited the highway, hit a rock, landed in almost 2ft Of mud."
"Nah, it sounds like the previous estimates were just outdated. Elon mentioned on Twitter that there have been numerous hardware tweaks in recent months and the 19"" wheels being used here are new (presumably more efficient)."
"I'm not trying to be mean just blunt and honest. I feel bad for those that have ever called you a friend because that's not how you talk to another person with decency.

If you ever want to become happy there are a lot of studies that show the most reliable predictor of happiness is the strength of that individuals personal relationships.

All the best."
Awesome!  Prepare yourself for A LOT of attention!
It‚Äôs only 4% but it‚Äôs as easy as contacting your delivery advisor and they can give you your options.  My 2016 S was in a similar situation and the car had the new features at delivery - to my pleasant surprise.
"It works for me. Right above the bit about changes may affect your delivery date, on the right, there's a link labeled ""Edit Design"". I clicked on that, made the change and got an email confirmation in a couple of minutes."
"Purchased in May, delivery in June. Doubt I will make the cut off. But ‚Äúrecent‚Äù just does not give enough details. Need a production month."
259 miles-201 miles =58 miles? Where are you pulling the 20 mile range difference from?
"They were both pre production but you‚Äôre right in not being a fair comparisson as the Model S Plaid was in earlier phases of development and will likely be a lot faster by the time it‚Äôs produced.

As for efficiency being better on the Taycan, no official test cycle demonstrates it as of yet and if Porsche chose to understate the car‚Äôs efficiency it will show up eventually as more people get to drive them in the real world. The usable capacity difference is 9 kWh afaik."
"Everything but that last one is correct. For bonus points it should also enable all windows to be electronically blinded. Imagine the activities you can do while parked. Elon, I know you're reading this so get to it"

"284....

That's lower than what I averaged in my LR RWD 3. I think I was at 287 wh/m at 23k before getting HW3 and not confirming what it was before having a complete system reset.
muahaha I get 300+W/h all the time

"But why would we have 1,000 mile range?  You would almost never drive that, and think of how long it would take to charge.  I‚Äôd much rather they focus on longevity and fast charging, now that we have a useful range

&#x200B;

... of course I may be biased since the Driving portion of my commute is like 3 miles, round trip.  I already would only charge weekly"
"For 1000mile range, you could put in a 250kWh battery, but that would be extremely inefficient, since you make so few trips where 1000 miles between stops is ever required. That vehicle would have to carry around all that weight for little benefit. So, a manufacturer, as soon as it got to 400mile range, would start to lower battery sizes, looking for the optimal utility between range and the need to recharge. With 250kW superchargers, and stations separated by 100 miles, there's little benefit to go beyond 400 miles of range."
Or maybe we will be stuck with the same battery tech for the next decade. Who knows?
Ohh I appreciate this explanation!! Thank you!! So the lower the better? Like 230 would be ideal since I have 325 miles?
"i know man, you dont have to tell me. I get 20 miles per 10% charge"
Yes I can get more than 10 miles just by turning off AC

"Sorry, miscalculated using the range of a Model S by mistake. 8.5% is still very high for just a year"
"Yes, he did say that on the conference call, but 9 hours ago he tweeted out: ‚ÄúMany small hardware improvements throughout the car that have been introduced gradually over past several months‚Äù

I'm not understanding this... How in the world does a software upgrade unlock extra battery life?
"So the range doesn't have much to do with what your true range will be. Tesla takes the true battery readings and runs them through a formula that spits out the most optimistic range number similar to EPA numbers.

That's why a much better assessment is presented on the power consumption screen which looks at average power consumption to predict when you will run out.

If the EPA revised their testing or Tesla revised how they adhere to EPA tests, they can then revise the formula used to calculate the range number. I'm sure they stick to the EPA model to avoid any lawsuits of false advertisements. We all know that any vehicle will have varying energy consumption depending on use and environment so a standard test cycle such as EPA or WLTP is used for advertisement."
"Performance motors have lower efficiency versus non-P in order to get that performance. Obviously since LR+ just came out I can't verify it, but this looks to be a fundamental software change in the motors of non-P models rather than a modification to the battery pack. Although it could be a hardware change the small units. 

If the battery pack was updated, we would probably see either a performance improvement or additional range on P's. 

I do hope it is all just software though, I'd pay to get that upgrade on my 2020 raven!

Edit: Just noticed the wheels changed too - this is a 4.8% improvement from LR, so it could just be a combination of new software + tempest wheels. Aero wheels on the Model 3 give about a 3.5% improvement to range, so it would line up pretty well, and Elon said in the Q1 call that they were still finding ways in motor firmware to increase range, so a 1.3% increase from that seems feasible."
Maybe it's an improvement on the rear motors that the P doesn't share with the LR? Idk
"I love this post, it's like Geordi LaForge technobabble from Star trek but it's actually real life. Not applicable for me in my completely non-hacked s75d with a small rear motor but still super cool!"

"Taycan seems to actually be pretty solid, just Porsche-priced.  The others are underwhelming as fuck."
"Taycan? Their numbers have been spot on. In comparisons, Tesla actually took some heat for slightly exaggerating the numbers."
"Yeah I dont trust Taycan either, the car just gets better range than they advertise, can‚Äôt trust those low numbers!"
"Right, but there's no mention of actual numbers, or point of comparison. Are they comparing to a Model 3? S? Roadster 2.0? Cybertruck?

Until they say that they have 400 miles with 90kWh, it's meaningless. And that shouldn't be hard, if the Model S can get 390. All they need to do is make a car with less headroom, and there you have a more aerodynamic car.

This thing could be a miracle in the making. Or then it's not. Until we have actual data, instead of marketing speak, we don't know anything"
"Dropped in 200k, at around 250$ stock price some stocks and some options. Want to get a roadster and a big house to go with it"
Love to say it was planned- but like most good decisions in my life- got damn lucky with timing (Still part of me that wishes I dropped more- but can‚Äôt get mad at woulda coulda shoulda- I‚Äôll be happy with what I got)
"The most expensive Taycan is also the shortest range Taycan (and no it doesn‚Äôt cost 3x),  and the Performance Model S costs 30% more and gets 20% *less* range, so it‚Äôs obvious not all EVs go after miles per dollar as a benchmark.

The Porsche is really a different car for a different customer base... we are talking about paying $180k for a car and *folding mirrors* is still a $350 extra option, so if you care about value you‚Äôd have gotten a Tesla way before this 17 miles range increase already.

EDIT: Lmao to further reinforce my point, one of the earliest Taycan customers is [literally Bill Gates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV2tMP37ygs&feature=youtu.be&t=338) haha, apparently his first EV, so that's neat."
Porsche is a luxury car maker with a history of charging high prices. Accept this and move on
Model 3 performance is 322 mile range now
"Quality is still crap compared to, say Toyota though..."

35k Model 3 is still available if you call to order. This is a Model S which has always been an upper end premium vehicle. For the price it's a lot of car.
But it is though. You have to call for it's an off the menu item.

Pretty sure you can special order a model 3 Sr Currently without all for like 35-37...

Tesla X is 16.5ft long, so let's call it 17ft. So that is 5.88 car lengths behind to achieve these above 20% efficiencies (100/17=5.88) Obviously this was done on an ICE car, but figured I'd do some quick math for anyone else who was interested. 

Autopilot can choose between one and seven car lengths if I'm not mistaken, as I don't have one and I'm just a dreamer right now, but looks like with very little effort someone can achieve some solid efficiencies where they're looking to minimize stops and charge times."
"If you were regen limited due to temperature, the pack was also less efficient at those lower temperatures. Preconditioning / preheating helps get some of that range back."
"I hear this a lot for compact SUVs. Can you help me understand?

I have one sibling. Family drove sedans at one point. It seemed perfectly fine, even for trips where we brought stuff.

Ranges are basically the same. The Model S doesn't get anywhere close to its EPA range with sticky tires, yet the Taycan overshoots its EPA range with sticky tires."
"The Taycan was basically a production car. The Plaid was nowhere close to a production car and was more like a garage chop up. The Plaid drive will not be faster than what they lapped with. There is a huge difference in handling between a gutted car and a full interior car. The Plaid right now is just a fantasy.

The usable capacity difference is 12kWh. The Model S has 95kWh of usable battery and the Taycan has 83kWh. There have been independent magazine tests that show the Taycan range to be truly underrated. And like mentioned before, the Taycan uses more aggressive heavier rubber compared to the Model S. The Model S on Taycan rubber will more than likely fall below the Taycan."

500 isn't even really that difficult to achieve.
Because having a range of 1000 miles also means you will get some stupendous cycle life all around.
1000 mile range? Never drive that? Laughs in Midwesterner driving his family to a Florida vacation.
"The point is less having the range, but rather having extra energy density to waste. EVs only go as far as they do on as little energy as they do because they‚Äôre so efficient‚Äî take that away, such as via towing, using excessive heat, driving uphill, or driving faster, and you don‚Äôt go near as far. Having 1000 miles of rated range would enable you to tow, say, 10k lbs 300 miles at a 1% grade, which would be excellent. 

Engineering Explained made a great video on this that I‚Äôm too lazy to link right now."
"Charging to 50% is better for the battery and faster than charging near 100%, so having 1000 miles would get you more accurately around 400 miles of range, but in a much more reasonable charge time.

This would decrease the impact to the charging network as well."
"They already have 500+ mile and 620+ mile range vehicles planned.

I guarantee we‚Äôll have 1,000+ mile range for towing applications."
We're stick with the same battery tech as 2008.  It still got better!
"The lower the number, the less amount of energy your tesla is consuming for driving 1 mile.
Yes. 230 wh/m would equate to 325 miles.
definitely achievable...but, difficult.
In the end...it doesnt matter very much.  On long distant drives, if you want to go 90% of the battery (293 miles), then achieving 230 is possible..if going at lower highway speeds (55mph), backroads, etc."
Any time
"Then, I wont. lol

the cool thing is, it doesnt even matter.  The cost of electricity is so cheap, especially since I have solar...literally matters none."
Why would they put packs designed for a sedan into a semi? It'd make way more sense to custom design a whole new pack for it.
They're too big to be model 3 packs.  The prototype showed their size
"But isn't that a dependency?

Edit: sorry, just learned the is no dependency. But I think the MCU update is much less consequential than the AP hardware update."
[deleted]
I think the software update just has a more accurate prediction of battery life (which is longer) but I‚Äôm not 100% sure
"The software thinks the car is less efficient than it actually is, so when it's calculating the estimated range based on your battery % it currently ends up low-balling that."
Just switch the display to percentage of battery from miles of range and you won't see any difference.
"Me too, except I think the reaction will be largely positive: new Model S/X owners of the last few months will be glad that they got a range upgrade retroactively, free of charge. ü•≥

Which carmaker does that? They could easily have made this a $$$$ upgrade but didn't, and decided to reward S/X buyers."
That's when they lock up what you paid for so you get less than epa
"Yes and no.  Poor range for typical driving, so they show a user case based on best case for the Taycan, averaging 93mph, which doesn't show well for Tesla.  

Under everyday driving, the Taycan does better than EPA, bit not as well as Tesla is real world use.  In high speed, having the 2 speed transmission,  the Taycan is superior, but realistically only at speeds over what's legal in most countries."
They claimed 100 more miles thanit got.  It's a nice car but the claims weren't true
"EPA is responsible for the numbers, not Tesla...."
"Holy shit, talk about going all in!"
"I own two whole shares, so just compare yourself to me if you want to feel like you‚Äôre killing it!"

"I guess that depends a lot on what types of trips u make and how old the kids are. 

We have a Model S, its trunk+frunk is 900Liters compared to the 400 whatever on the Model 3 and 500? On the Y? 

We currently only have 1 kid but when we go away on longer trips, say a week abroad we will fill the car to its very maximum. With second kid coming we might have to go for the Model X even.

Basicly a stroller takes up 1/3 of the trunk and a twin stoller will easely take up almost all of the trunk space alone.
Then you need all that other stuff you need for kids... which is a lot if you plan to stay away for a week or so.

So basicly if you just use the car to drive kids around town its more than big enough but if u like road trips its way small"
"They are normal, but EVs aren't"
"Perhaps, I'm in California. It could also be that your car has started being built. My order is still identified by an order number, I'm told that once they start building it the order number will change to a VIN."

"The Taycan was a pre production car by definition as for the Plaid drive train being better then when development had just started to when it‚Äôs finished and put into production contradicts Tesla entire car development history. It‚Äôs not a fantasy in the least as it‚Äôs meant to be developed for the Roadster anyway.

The usable capacity difference right now is 9 kWh, the Model S gets a bit more when it‚Äôs new but that larger capacity degrades in less than a year leaving the usable energy at 92kWh. The Plaid drivetrain ofc will get a larger capacity battery with higher peak power."

"Original tires, plenty left. My commute is 40 miles a day near 80mph and in the winter I crank the heat like crazy."
"Model 3 RWD, aero wheels. 235 lifetime. 11K miles in a year. California weather :)"
A 25% improvement on modelS LR+... they should be able to get there with the next gen battery.
"There's no reason to drive that distance *without charging* is what he means. Gas cars already only go at most 400 miles or so without a fillup. There just isn't a practical reason to put more range than that into the battery of an EV, when you could instead reduce the price and increase the charging speed."
Plus when autopilot becomes legal your car can replace a lot of traveling you would do on planes/trains etc as long as you‚Äôre willing to sacrifice some time to charge & be driven around.
"With solar, yes, but if you had to buy from a utility company at the national average of 12.5¬¢/kWh, then comparing $/kWh-to-$/kWh against gasoline, it‚Äôs actually more expensive. A gallon of gas has 33.7kWh and costs maybe $3. 33.7kWh at 12.5¬¢/kWh multiplies to $4.21. 

The main reason EVs are so cheap to run is due to the efficiency; personally I get around 68 MPGe... when flooring it. But take that away and it‚Äôd be cheaper to fuel a gas car."
No it wouldn't. Why design a new pack when you could just use existing off the shelf systems? Ever wonder why the semi had multiple charge ports?
I'd take a touchscreen that doesent suck over a half baked sensor suite. AP2 was.....bad when it came out and only got slightly better after 2.5 was released.
"Elon tweeted that there are hardware changes to cars made after November, so you are correct that people who took delivery last month also have this range. However this does *not* apply to all cars made before November that do not have the hardware improvements, so this isn‚Äôt just a software update that is boosting the range for all of the model Ss."
"You are joking right? 

The word ""free of charge"" tells me.only one thing: soon, very soon, buying a Tesla will be the same as buying a game. High price, not complete and to have access to.everything one need to.pay extra for each pack.

Tesla is the EA of cars."
"Depends. Elon just said that there is no actual hardware change, just that the EPA numbers weren't updated.

That would mean that all cars have the capability, but only newer ones will have the software capability. So older Teslas are software limited to fewer miles.

You could make the argument of ""why would those owners care, they bought it with that original range"" but it doesn't really hold up irl. Just like all the price drops."
"Sure, but the Taycan isn't really trying to be a single car replacement, IMO.  A little less range is fine if you're not using it as a road trip car.  It's pretty good at what it's trying to be, especially for their first consumer EV.  I think part of that is that they could push a little harder trying to bump specs closer to Tesla because they can absorb it with the Porsche price cushion.

I dunno, I'm not really their target buyer."
"If typical driving isn't on the highway, then range doesn't matter at all because you'll never not be charged fully at home anyway.

How could you run out of range if you're driving only 25-50 mph? It's pretty much impossible to get far from home at those speeds."
"Well it's a german car, so it has to be accepted in Germany."
Highway speed tests also don‚Äôt show any impact of more efficient regen.  Since you‚Äôre at a constant power output the entire time.
Doesn‚Äôt it make more sense to compare the taycan to the roadster?
"You‚Äôre wrong. The testing is actually done by Tesla and provided to the EPA. The data is also extrapolated by a multiplier of Tesla‚Äôs choosing for various models. 

Btw, Here‚Äôs a fairly controlled test of the model S vs the taycan

"Don‚Äôt worry, you rarely actually need the range, and for the rare occasions you need it, don‚Äôt gun it."
I'm too drunk to really have a stake in this conversation but my M3P gets only 150 miles going from 90% to 20% which is all you're realistically going to be doing.

"Yes it would. You could cool a custom pack much more effectively than you could cool multiple separate packs. Not to mention shape them more efficiently for the available space, which is also a benefit for cooling.

Think of it this way: there is speculation that the long range Semi's pack is going to be between 900 to 1100 kWh. That's upwards of *15* Model 3 packs. Where the heck are they going to cram 15 packs shaped like the Model 3's pack? 

The answer is they won't. They'll build a custom pack that fits those cells into the available space under (and behind?) the cab."

"The majority of people buying Taycans aren‚Äôt the type of people who both:
A) Own just a Taycan
B) Are willing to take road trips with their EV when flying or driving their ICE car will be much quicker
The Taycan is an entirely different market than what Tesla is, & tbh shouldn‚Äôt be compared as equals because they‚Äôre both trying to achieve different goals. Both are great cars though."
"That's another downside of the Taycan. If you want to have an amazing, fast car you can spend $120K on a Model S and use it every day, or $300K on a Taycan and a daily driver, but only get to drive the amazing car when you don't need the range, and on other days you don't drive something you enjoy. Unless you get a Taycan and a Model 3, in which you get to drive to amazing cars but you still spent $180K more than with the Model S."
"It's crazy how fast this sub went from ""highway speed range is the most important range"" to ""everyday range is the most important range"" the second after the taycan showed that it's as good as a model S Performance at higher speeds (75mph)"
"You could actually get further from home driving those speeds, since you‚Äôd use less energy."
No it makes sense to compare the taycan to cars that already exist and not something that might exist in the future with specs claimed by some manufacturer. Otherwise we can also compare the model s to a sedan concept that is going to be released in 2 years by any other company that has 600 miles range in theory.
"That's highway 75mph with no speed changes.  Keep in mind the Taycan has a 2-speed transmission that kicks in at 50mph.  If you did a range test at 90mph, I'm sure the Taycan Turbo S would have a longer range than the Model S Performance.

The question is, how does the Taycan do in the city?"
"

Motortrend got nearly 400 miles on a real world trip when they tested the LR model S on a trip from San Francisco Bay Area to Los Angeles.  This is certainly a more relevant test.

I'd like to see them repeat it with this latest Model S LR and the Taycan S so we can put this BS away about driving in an oval track for 100 miles at 75mph as a valid range test."

That makes sense.  I'd imagine most owners of the Taycan Turbo S (who don't buy it as a toy) would have owned an EV before making such a large purchase.
"Once a Porsche driver, always a Porsche driver!"

I'll probably get downvoted. I'm still stoked that's he's finally driving an electric car though, even if it's a Porsche."

"Ouch, now that sounds bad, but I believe it. Need to make sure I can get a charger installed"
"Huh, I might have to check in on that cause that sounds cool. Thanks for the info"
30 min of climate got me 50% regen. Better than nothing but still seems less than optimal
I thought low tire pressure decreased efficiency but increased traction?
"I average 429. City traffic only, in Scotland."
It worsens wh/mi. It's easy to get a higher wh/mi average (worse efficiency) if you use the heater.
"I figure by the time all this is possible battery tech & charging tech will be at a stage where we can drive/be driven anywhere in the lower 48 within 48 hours. The biggest benefit to this I see is the implementation of the Tesla automated charger (not the actual name, but the snake like charger that comes out of the SC & automatically docks to your car). That‚Äôs my largest gripe about Teslas is that most supercharger places don‚Äôt have a roof (I know, small complaint but whenever I drive my ICE cars I never get wet when filling up at a station because they‚Äôve always got roofs over them)."
"That‚Äôs awesome, but also unusually low. I‚Äôm referring to the average case, and not sure why I was downvoted for that. 

Honestly I‚Äôm surprised solar made any financial sense for your use case."
I think they could do that range with that payload with 6-8 packs of 80 kwh each.
"Yes, but *over several years*."
"Yes, but *over several years*."
I don't understand the logic behind comparing a $150K car to a $100K car. You would expect much better car at $50K more.  On YouTube people argue over $5K between two cars and how the cheaper one has so much more value.
Yup. Between our LR RWD 3 and P100D X we can't ever get near the rated ranges since we do lots of highway driving. I think the 60+ MPH is the most critical area as its what you need to long distance drives.
"It isn't that.  The test was averaging 93mph, which is applicable in pretty much only Germany, only on select roads and only a specific times due to congestion.   These are not highway speeds seen in any other country, these are illegal speeds most everywhere else in the world."
But no one does because it would make no sense. Who would ever increase their commute time 2-3x just to save a few dollars in energy?
Probably closer to EPA-range lol? Tesla seems to take a range loss
The article states they say in the L.A traffic. Also they had downward elevation. Both significantly aid the range.
Teslas are very popular in California where 75 mph is the common driving speed on most interstates even though the speed limits are 65-70 mph.
"Well let‚Äôs be honest, a $180k car for Bill Gates doesn‚Äôt count as ‚Äúlarge purchase‚Äù by any stretch of imagination lol. The Porsche 959 he drives around, which I linked earlier, has a market value of $3M alone.

To him, who‚Äôs worth $60B+, buying a $200k car is exactly the same as someone who has $1M buying a single ~~tank~~ gallon of gas lol.

If he bought Porsche, the company, then yeah, that would have been a large purchase haha."
"I think most Taycan owners will be current Porsche owners looking to upgrade. I can see a lot of Panamera owners going for this as their next car.

Like Tesla, their owners are pretty die hard fans who probably have wanted an EV for a while and have been waiting for Porsche to come out with something compelling before jumping ship to Tesla."
"> but when the root cause of nearly every modern problem is overpopulation on an unprecedented scale, one of humanities wealthiest is trying to save every human with vaccines in Africa.

Hmm...I think I saw someone with similar ideas in a recent Marvel movie..."
some of us remember when bill gates was considered to be evil personified. it does seem like he might be up to something in africa.
"Mine had that when I bought it used (2015 S). It was cool and all, but the seat didn‚Äôt fold down, so I swapped it out for a standard rear seat."
If he worked for a large company & was vital to their success they could have it in their contract that he isn‚Äôt allowed to drive himself & the company pays for a car service to drive the individual wherever they want to go.
"Yeah, heating the pack takes a while on a 3 since you‚Äôre also heating the drive unit. FWIW the battery efficiency falloff is worse at the colder temps, so pre-heating helps especially if you start plugged in and then go on a longer drive. If you start a short drive on a freezing pack then the cells will be less efficient as well as the car burning through power trying to raise battery temp above the minimum target (somewhere around 10c IIRC), all while the cabin heater consumes 6KW trying to reach your climate target. That‚Äôs the triple whammy that makes range especially poor in freezing weather."
"It does, and at 381wpm, that guy must be driving on 35psi."
Unrelated buy how is the infrastructure here? Not really looked into to it but i have also not seen a single supercharger station here.
"Yeah, that sounds possible. Shortish urban journeys are inefficient in an EV just like in a poison car."
"With 2 teslas,  2 air conditioning units, heated pool..."
"The numbers Tesla have released about how long range the Semi is and how efficient is it put the pack size for the 500 mile version at about 1 MWh. Eight 80kWh packs come out to only 640 kWh. That's how much the 300 mile range one might have, but not the 500.

And where are they going to put those 8 packs, anyway? Stack them up right under the cab, wasting tons of horizontal space (since the cab is much wider than the Model 3)? I think not."
"Nope:

> ""All S/X cars **made in recent months** have actually been above stated EPA range. Will be unlocked soon for free via software update."""
"Recently too, hence the new roa rating and new name.  Tweetstorms are hard to follow but it's there"
"They shouldn‚Äôt be compared because they‚Äôre targeting two entirely different markets. The Taycan is looking at being a car that you use daily (but not for long trips because flying or using your ICE Range Rover will be much quicker since you don‚Äôt have to stop & charge). The Tesla is trying to be your one car replacement, whether it be for daily driving or those long trips you take. Both are great cars but just trying to achieve different goals."
I wasn't talking about the test by next move but about the test from car and driver which was at 75mph. The taycan had only 10m less range than a model S Performance in that one.
"I thought we are talking about getting far away from home, not commuting? If your goal is to get as far away from home as possible on one charge you should absolutely drive slower, is my point."
In city Tesla can get double epa range
[deleted]
"It's even more extreme than that. $1 million is 1/60000th of $60 billion. 1/60000th of $200,000 is $3.33. So it's kind of like a person with $1 million deciding whether or not to buy a drink at Starbucks, except $3.33 probably wouldn't cover the entire drink so it's a proportionately more significant decision.  $3.33 may also get you a container of ice cream... I think for most of Tesla's customers, if they get a flavor of ice cream they don't like they'd simply throw it out and get a different one. So at his level... didn't like the Taycan in blue? Go back to the store and get black.  He could buy a $200k car every day for the next 821 years.... if he earned nothing on his money. 3% a year on $60 billion is $1.8 billion, or $4.9 million a day. A DAY.  So even if he bought a $200k car every day he'd still have to figure out what to do with that other $4.7 million. 

&#x200B;

I think that level of wealth is nearly incomprehensible for most people. Even for someone with $100 million which is extremely wealthy by most standards... Someone with $60 billion can earn that in all of 3 weeks. While we're at it, I think Bill Gates current net worth is estimated at more in the range of $100 billion and  Jeff Bezos is at something like $130 billion. That's enough to get you over $10 million a day, or two Taycan Turbo S an hour with money left over. Completely mind boggling wealth."
"In the corporate world, he and his company are indeed still evil."
"Sure, but we're talking about Bill Gates here. He doesn't work for anyone."
"Is that high for those tires? I don't own a Tesla, but it seems high."
Yeah our Model X P100D is at 51 psi and usually below that number if not speeding or frozen
"Scotland is EV heaven.  

There are a few super chargers (Edinburgh, Glasgow, Perth, Aviemore, maybe more) and a few more planned. But the highlight of EV life in Scotland is the public charging network. Most of the charge points are free, there are many rapid chargers and many many more fast chargers. The rapid chargers are 50kW, so you can go from 40% -> 90% in about an hour. There are also some non-free private chargers.  

I only do 50% of my charging at home. For the rest I charge for free on the public ones, either on a rapid or on the 7kW charger near my work. There are so many, it is likely you‚Äôll have one near your work as well, check zap-map website.  

In addition, most, sometimes all, the electricity of Scotland comes from renewables, no long-tailpipe arguments bullshit here.  

There are also good government grants, we get an extra ¬£300 (on top of the standard UK grant) for home charging installation and we also get an interest-free loan of up to ¬£35k to buy an EV.  

My 3 costs me a lot less than anything at the same level, it is nearly 100% clean and extremely useable."
Not a Tesla owner (yet!) but I think there's at least 3 superchargers on motorways. The ChargePlace Scotland network is great though. Plenty of 50kw rapids and 7kw destination chargers around and it's getting better and better as time goes on. Been driving leafs for 5 years and rarely had issues finding chargers (Ayrshire/Glasgow mainly)
"It‚Äôs odd to me that the only real reason they‚Äôre being compared is seemingly due to powertrain. But you wouldn‚Äôt compare a Cummins to a diesel Cruze, so why this?!"
I never thought I‚Äôd hear a Porsche being known as a daily driver (other than the SUVs). I don‚Äôt think the Taycan is a daily driver in the north with snow and potholes everywhere.
"Why would someone want to do that though? That's the point. Who has ever ended up 300 miles away from home averaging 30 mph?

It would be like driving side streets for 10 hours."
It absolutely cannot.
[deleted]
"I will only talk about I know although most of the US is likely very similar. People care about range the most when driving long distances; in Washington, Oregon, and California that means interstate driving at 75 mph."
"Oops, I actually meant a gallon of gas instead of a tank of gas. I did the same math as you haha."
"This is a really really excellent comment and explanation.  Kudos to you - it seems like absolutely nobody understands the levels of wealth these people have, and you really bring it home."
Not anymore
"Sorry, for reference, 45psi is factory recommended. You can dramatically affect the range by over inflating or deflating above and below 45psi. So 55psi will give you maybe up to 5-8% greater range on the highway at the cost of ride quality and uneven tire wear. Lower psi can have the same opposite affect. As for the rim size, the difference between 19"" and 21"" rims is about 6%, with the 21's being less efficient."
Because it‚Äôs a EV car
"https://electrek.co/2017/08/04/a-tesla-model-s-100d-just-drove-670-miles-1078km-on-a-single-charge

That was back when epa range was only 330 miles so it's probably closer to 800 with these new changes."
Exactly
[deleted]
"Okay... so why aren‚Äôt the diesel Cruze and diesel A8 cross shopped? They‚Äôre both cars with the same powertrain after all... who cares that they cater to two completely different customers?!

The logic just doesn‚Äôt hold up."
[Checked.](https://www.iihs.org/topics/speed/speed-limit-laws) 40 of 50 states' rural interstates appear to have speed limits of 70 mph or above with half of those having speed limits of 75 mph or more. If the other half doesn't have traffic that goes 5 over the speed limit then I would be very surprised.
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm 100% agreeing with you, these products should not be compared as they serve a different purpose. People compare any EV to a Tesla (especially one from an established auto group) because Tesla is more or less the reddit standard when it comes to EV‚Äôs regardless of the EV‚Äôs mission."

I'm surprised Giga Australia isn't next on the list given Australia's appetite for battery storage solutions combined with their relative wealth and favorable climate for batteries.
"Tesla biggest problem? I'm intrigued! *click*

""Tesla's biggest problem right now is not having a factory on each continent..""

god damnit.."
Customer service is fixed by a factory on each continent?
"What Elon left out (apart from import duties):

Tesla's direct sales model means a car is not sold until it is delivered to the end consumer. The time between production and sale is a period that has to be financed by Tesla, it absorbs a LOT of cash. Increasing production numbers mean the amount of blocked cash is growing fast.

Shipments across oceans increase the time gap between production and sale. Probably more expensive than all other factors mentioned."
Just been chatting with my brother about that. The environmental impact of shipping cars from the US to Australia can't be insignificant
They'll produce the Lotus submarine in Giga Atlantis.
I got downvoted into oblivion suggesting they'd do a Gigafactory in Africa about 6 months ago.

Which isssssss quality control?
Can we start with Australia please üôÇ
If Australia gets a Gigafactory that'd be fucking amazing. There's a 20% tariff on all vehicle imports. Fuck me a Tesla for 20% less than what we pay now would be great.
TIL Texas is a continent.
"I feel like Tesla's biggest problem is handing the maintenance and repair demand for all the cars they've been selling...  One or two service centers per metropolitan area ain't gonna cut it now, nevermind places that don't have _any_."

Omg I didn't see continent lol. Yeah you right it's getting smaller every year unfortunately
Yoh! Elon we love you and it‚Äôs about fckn time you came back to Africa to pay forward some proper pretty EV love!
GigaAfrica yeah üòé
Giga Cochabamba gets my vote as most fun to say.
Sounds like a good idea...
The biggest problem Tesla the carmaker has is the growth in cars sold is outpacing the growth in mechanics and it's only getting worse.
Well Africa isn't an option
Service?
I really hope that Giga Texas factory gets built. Hopefully then some legislation gets changed in that state as well as public perception for teslas out there.
Oh their biggest problem? I don't see how this helps service and post-sale experience. They could produce more parts for the service backlog but they could also be doing that now...
Antarctica?
World domination?

Wonder what sort of maps will Tesla be using to determine their Gigafactories. Hopefully it'll be a map without New Zealand as it should be done.
"Pretty sure this is how Arizona Iced Tea kept their cans 99¬¢, their biggest expense was shipping so they built more, smaller factories."
"or partner with Toyota since they already have everything setup.

"yes, I call dibs on Antarctica"
And then we might even get one in Australia!
Metallica did it.
"Fun fact of the day. Antarctica is a desert. Average precipitation is 50-150mm annually.  For comparison Nevada averages ~250mm. 

It makes sense when you realize it never really gets warm enough to melt much down there. If they received heaps of snow, the continent would be miles high by now."

"There‚Äôs only 24 million people in Aus, there‚Äôs the same number of people on the New York Subway every day (probably)

It‚Äôs a good place to test battery storage tech but the markets not big enough"
"Our car industry has died over the last few years with both Holden and Ford ceasing production here. There are at least two very large Ford plants here - one in Melbourne and another in Geelong - that have been abandoned  for several years. They would have been good places for Tesla to move into in earlier years as I imagine Ford will be wanting someone to move into it and they might get a good deal, like they did with the Fremont plant.

That said, it‚Äôd probably be easier for Tesla to just start from scratch rather than having to refurbish old Ford factories, given that money isn‚Äôt so tight nowadays.

If they were to consider the Ford plants here, though... The Melbourne one would be better than Geelong simply due to the fact it‚Äôs closer to main highways, a skilled workforce, and it‚Äôs a bigger site. That said, they could certainly do cars in Melbourne and solar/battery production in Geelong, if they needed even more space. 

In any case, Melbourne has a lot of car manufacturing history and would have the best-suited workforce in the country, I‚Äôd imagine. 

...also I live in Melbourne and want a Tesla factory nearby. üòú"
We actually have the 2nd largest reserve of lithium in the world. Tesla Mining anyone?
Small population. Our own car company isn't even made here (Holden). Our wages are too high to be profitable apparently.
"It won't receive the same love here. Our countries leaders and media are fairly pro ""there's no such thing as climate change, let's eat some coal"".

Even the big battery Tesla built here has received a lot of hate by our politicians who spin it off as a failed attempt at providing unlimited power to all of Australia (bit of hyperbole there but you get the gist) and the Australian people believing everything our politicians sprout from their brown holes.

It's a shame really. Also, our economy is spiralling out of control and our future isn't looking too promising. Really hope things change but there's just too many sheeple here to get my hopes up too much."
All the major manufactures have left Australia due to the small market and expensive labour. I think the next logical place would be South East Asia or India (if Tesla can be bothered wit the bureaucracy).
"It only makes sense if the Australian Government starts to play ball with EVs, the current government wouldn't even think about it."
"I imagine eventually at least one of India and Japan will get a Gigafactory, and at that point, that's right hand drive basically covered."
We are a shit destination for car makers. There's a reason all car manufacturing shut down here a few years back
"Well hes waiting for that burnt up wasteland to be pennies on the dollar and force poor Aussie farmers with nothing left to sell....

Sad but probably true. Why buy the middle when Coastal areas around Melbourne are about to be dirt cheap"
"Australia's export capability for cars was not very good (most car carriers arriving there would leave nearly empty), and its geographic isolation drove up costs. That is why car assembly died out."
We have little market for electric cars. Hell our petrol car manufacturing industry couldn‚Äôt survive even while selling pretty popular cars. We‚Äôre just a tiny market that usually isn‚Äôt worth focusing on beyond being a test market for international corporations.
"That‚Äôs ok with me, as the electricity generation Situation in AUS is such that EVs are worse than iCEs for co2 production no matter how long they are on the road or how many miles they are driven."
Lol
Parts availability might be helped.
I was about to post this but then I realized I'd get downvoted to hell.
I'm getting worried about the problems stacking up on that end. I wonder what they consider to be the tipping point to have to pay more attention to this.
"Hoo hoo, that's a risky one."
Customer service and don't forget build quality. My 3 goes in for the 6th time next week.
"Exactly.  It comes down to payment terms with suppliers.  If you're net 30, and it takes 45 days to ship/sell to Europe. That means Tesla is footing the bill for 15 days until customers pay.  


With Hundreds of cars being sent in the 15 day window, it could be 15mil+ they are banking, (500 cars assuming 30k actual cost each).  If you can flip that, and do delivery within 15 days of completion, that free's up 15 Mil in cash, effectively using the supplier as the bank until the net date is due.

Honestly a pretty interesting case study."
This is the right answer. Should be further up.
"Not sure i understand this one. Does Tesla have a cashflow problem? 

I mean the cars will eventually get delivered. Its like a rolling outstanding revenue. Unless Tesla needs to borrow this cash which cost money i dont see the issue? If production increases the outstanding revenue outthere increases and they need cash to cover this but is this actually an issue?

I understand the argument in a cash constrained company, but Tesla now?"
I figured if we didn't have a factory here we'd need to start getting the cars from China soon.
"It‚Äôs really not all that bad. Ships are by far the most fuel efficient way to move anything, and the next best option isn‚Äôt even in the same ballpark. 

But fwiw the nominal number for ships is they can move a ton of cargo 650 miles on one gallon of gas. So California to Australia, about 8,000 miles takes roughly 30 gallons of fuel.  Probably a little more because car carriers aren‚Äôt as efficient as bulk cargo, but pretty much in that range."
"Classic Reddit. I see no reason why this couldn't be the case. Giga Africa would probably be focused on the affordable Tesla, and solar energy if possible."
"Musk is from South Africa, so it has an advantage for location. 

However, even though SA is by far the biggest car manufacturer in Africa, it's still small globally; 616k vehicles in 2015."
Because it's a bad idea?
"In Egypt , next to the pyramids!"
"Ask Texans, and they'd say yeah"
"That'll come eventually, orbital dock yard turning out Starships. If the first one isn't called Kuat Drive Yards I'll be most upset."
"Having watched the video this is from, I can try to provide context from memory:

In Fremont, Tesla currently spends the first month of each quarter producing cars for europe/asia. The 2nd month producing cars for the Eastern US, and the 3rd Month producing cars for the western US. This results in the cars all arriving at their destinations near the end of the quarter. Producing cars locally on each continent will break this ""wave"", and allow for more consistent deliveries.

It also means that they have less shipping costs and less permutations of the car to manufacture in one facility. Previously they've had issues with the wrong sticker being in place for that country and thus the cars get held up at the port."
Supply
Not a continent. Just one big-ass iceberg... getting smaller every year...
Heckle heckle.
"QC I think has been improved.
Service centre experience... Well, ok, I almost cancelled my Model 3 because of my my SC experience.. (took delivery this morning).  To think they couldn‚Äôt even give me a 5 minute once over with the vehicle is mind boggling...

I‚Äôve never given a company so much money then literally feel like a burden to them."
In service center in each state and major metro would go a long way towards the service center experience.
Maybe when they hit a slow in growth
"And batteries, plus extra parts for the body shop."

But that's just an island!
"My thoughts is that an Australian GF could be, initially, dedicated to RHD vehicles.  Most RHD countries are in the Pacific region or around the Indian Ocean, two places Australia has direct access to.  If you consider our Li reserves, other raw material reserves, and generally stable business climate it seems quite attractive."

It is less efficient to achieve orbit if you launch from more extreme latitutes. That's why the US launch facility is in Florida and the Russian one is in Kazakhstan.

"If the Gigafactory for China remains exclusive to China, Giga Australia could cover some other parts of asia; however it would have to be more north, otherwise you won't be saving that much on shipping costs. Probably would make more sense to stick a factory in SEA instead (lower labor costs too).

That being said a ""mega"" factory (like others have suggested) could make sense on a limited scale. Could also target all the right hand drive countries as well in SEA + Japan."
Average 5.5 mil per day
"It‚Äôs a little over 25, but yeah, it‚Äôs a small (but wealthy) market."
a work week will have more people on the subway.    still your point is proven.
"Alright maybe the market isn't there for cars (yet) to sustain a car plant, but a factory dedicated to energy storage batteries would seem to make sense. The market is maturing nicely in Australia plus India, with their massive solar fields being deployed, is a quick boat ride away. 

Alternatively, maybe an Indian plant for the same reasons but with much cheaper labor."
"Starting with a battery/energy factory making powerwalls and solar roofs seems like the smart move. We have so much demand for solar and home batteries. 

I can imagine they would destroy the local ICE market if they could then ramp up some cheap Model 3/Y/CyberUtes."
"I think the Geelong plant has already been acquired. Can't remember who or why. If only I had some way of Googling it to find out. 

Isn't the Toyota plant essentially vacant now too?"
"While I'd love to see Tesla produce cars in Australia also, they will probably just find themselves in the same situation as the manufacturers that left the country, that being that it is simply not profitable enough for anyone to produce cars here due to high manufacturing costs such as wages. Perhaps with Tesla being on the high end of the price list they won't be affected as much as with Ford and Holden who were selling $30-$40k cars compared to Tesla at well over $100k."
"If the economics of making an EV in Austrailia are indeed sensible, then why hasn't an Austrailian entrepreneur (I say Austrailian because I assume an Austrailian business person would be more familiar with the country's opportunities but really it could be any entrepreneur) taken a stab at opening a domestic Austrailian EV car company? There are at least four EV car companies (not including traditional auto makers like Nissan, VW, Audi, etc.) in the US including Tesla, so the viability of EV technology is already proven. My guess is that the economics must not make sense yet for Austrailia because of some limiting factor we're not considering. It could be something like a lack of indigenous technical labor (like engineers rather than line workers), the expense of shipping resources to the factories (this could be the cost of shipping the raw resources (cobalt, lithium, etc.) there needed to make the batteries or even shipping pre-assembled batteries to the car assembly plants), the cost of labor (I have no idea how much Austrailian workers are paid. I know the US labor cost is quite high and we have Tesla factories here, but the labor cost here is at least partially offset by the advantage of having immediate access to the US' large auto market. I don't know that the auto market size in Austraila offsets the labor costs of production there quite as much), technical issues (like long periods of high temperatures or temperatures that often fluctuate wildly) that might affect EVs there more than other places thereby increasing warranty costs, etc. I don't know, I'm just spitballing. Tesla is awesome, but I would also like competitors around the world to step up in the global push for more EVs/more sustainability tech."
"> There are at least two very large Ford plants here - one in Melbourne and another in Geelong - that have been abandoned  for several years. They would have been good places for Tesla to move into in earlier years as I imagine Ford will be wanting someone to move into it and they might get a good deal, like they did with the Fremont plant.
> That said, it‚Äôd probably be easier for Tesla to just start from scratch rather than having to refurbish old Ford factories, given that money isn‚Äôt so tight nowadays.

I think Elon has said that all new GFs will be new-builds due to the efficiency improvements available compared to refurbishing an old factory.  Having said that, the existing plants are ideally located and can probably be had on the cheap since there are no other buyers."
"With autonomy on the rise (Rio Tinto is experimenting with driverless trains in the Pilbara), and the fact that most large mining equipmnt is now electric or hybrids, it might make sense for Tesla to integrate the mining and refining operations.  Probably an edge case, however, as mines are pretty resource-intensive to start up."
"I keep thinking the same thing, but there's no way the cost of a Tesla comes down significantly if we don't make it locally. They wouldn't need to make very many to eat a significant portion of our annual car sales and disrupt the competition."
I'd be happy with Japan. Japanese engineering is as good as the Germans when they want it to be. Not when they are concerned with making economy vehicles
Honestly I'd be pretty leery about buying an Indian-built car over a Chinese one.

"Pretty sure even coal-powered electrics are better than ICE, overall pollutant wise. Not by that much but they are still better."

"Other manufacturers are essentially glorified banks that ""sell"" cars immediately off of their balance sheet, but finance both the dealership and the end customer to the point that the true turnover from car to cash is actually far higher than Tesla's.

Tesla has a unique opportunity to create billions of dollars of additional capital in an industry that is extremely capital intensive.  Other popular case studies of companies that have created novel ""cash float"" include GEICO (by going against the grain of the time and running profitably) and Amazon (by being e-comm and releasing the massive cash hoards stuck in retail tills).

More or less, getting access to billions of dollars of interest free loans that none of your competitors have usually ends up in victory."
"No not at this point.
But cash costs. Yes, they borrowed the cash.
Cash that could be used to earn cash (invested in ....) is sitting still gathering dust, costing money, reducing profit.

This the cost is growing fast!

‚ÄúWe are spending cash as fast as we can‚Äù = yes there are constraints, there always are.
They cannot all these millions.
Rising cost conflicts with the masterplan: Trying to lower the price of a Tesla, to get everyone in a EV
This requires improving everything involved in improving EVs + energy + whatever = costly investments, requiring cash

Also:

a good remedy would be fitting 15"" or 16"" wheels with bigger tires. we have 2 Model 3s in the house and the ride quality doesn't feel at all plush.

"Well. I‚Äôm not an expert. I‚Äôm basing the comment on this study. https://res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/sustainability/sustainability-11-02690/article_deploy/sustainability-11-02690.pdf if you‚Äôve got better info, please point me to it. I‚Äôm interested in this issue and interested in getting actual information. 

The problem seems to be that battery manufacturing has a huge co2 cost. The co2 debt for EV production vs ICE isn‚Äôt paid off for 60k to 120k (km) of driving even with a big mix of renewables in the grid electric production. It‚Äôs eventually paid off in Eur, US, Japan, and China, but never in AUS. See p. 9. 

Since the co2 cost for EVs is from electricity used making the batteries, they should be building (and driving) them in places with better renewable mixes in their grid energy mix. That way the initial CO2 debt vs ICEs isn‚Äôt as great AND the debt is paid back at a greater rate.

What Tesla should be doing is leaning on govts to clean up their grid and only building gigafactories in places that have demonstrated that their grid is ‚Äùhospitable‚Äù to EVs from a lifecycle perspective. Australia is not, and it would be shitty of Tesla not to take that into account when deciding where to put their factories."
Actually Tesla fanboys are the first to point out Tesla‚Äôs bad customer service. Comes up all the time on the Tesla subreddit.
"I think it's mainly a problem of limited resources. All of Tesla's resources have been dedicated to growth and meeting demand. I'm ok with that up to a point. Now that the company is viable and beginning to see some profits, they're going to have to dedicate more resources to service."
"Got mine in Sep 2018. It has had about 40 individual problems and counting, ranging from major (windshield replacement, front motor replacement, left turn signal not working right, brake lights not coming on when they should) to minor/moderate (loose door hinge squeak,  horrendously painted front bumper, all sorts of HVAC noises, loose fasteners/grommets). 

Then there's the software problems. Lots of ""quirks"". The persistent door unlock issue that's been a thorn in my side since the car was new. The random weird emergency steering events that try to plow me into a wall (don't even have autopilot). The horrendous wipers that are only just in the last couple months starting to get a *little* better.

They've managed to fix most of the software quirks. It was really bad in 2018 and early 2019. Things like car not going into F/R, reverse display taking 5-20 seconds to pop up, and the interface crashing."
"As of January 1st of this year they are burning either gasohol ( a diesel blend), LNG (methane), or HFO with scrubbers to pull out the pollution. This was a major change that started about 7 years ago. But as of the 1st all ships must be compliant or they can‚Äôt port in any IMO country."
"We could've had nuclear powered container ships by now, which would've easily solved the emissions problem, but noooooooooooooooooo, nUcLeAr Is DaNgErOuS. So no one's invested in that tech making it too expensive and not worth the cost to build new ships with a nuclear power plant."
"It depends on WHICH emissions you are talking about.

In the case of CO2 emissions are basically synonymous with fuel consumption.  

The other factor is that even if the fuel is fairly dirty they are hauling a LOT of tonnage, so the emissions per ton-mile is probably a lot lower than flying stuff around.  I bet it beats trucking it too, though I wouldn't be surprised if trains are comparable or maybe better in some regards.

Just from googling it seems like a typical container ship can carry about 55kT of cargo.  A 747 can carry 250T total though that has to be split between cargo and fuel.  I wouldn't be surprised if it burns more than 2x the weight of the payload in fuel going from the US to Australia.  I'm sure it burns pretty clean, but still...

Container shipping rates are such that it seems like it only costs about a dollar to ship 14T across the ocean, so they can't be burning that much fuel to do it..."

"I live in Europe, so... under 30 min from FL launch site."
Ofc it does. Launching from the equator with the direction the earth spins is a free 1000mph.
"It still matters as the Earth's spin helps add some delta-v to get you out of a gravity well.

Where it doesn't help is with polar orbits, which can be launched from nearly anywhere with a clear ocean going north or south.  Vandenberg has clear water to Antarctica and Scotland is a good polar orbit site too.  Russia has a polar orbit site on the Arctic Ocean."
"> To be fair, if you don't want to orbit, but leave the planet's gravity well entirely, I don't think it matters where you launch from.

"Unlike the US, Australia‚Äôs population is largely concentrated in two cities: Sydney (~5.3m) and Melbourne (~5m).

Despite having 13x the overall population, the US only has one city with a higher population than this: New York (~8.4m), with Los Angeles coming in behind (~4m).

To put that a bit more in perspective, those two Aussie cities are approximately the same distance apart as San Diego to San Francisco.  So servicing the majority of Australia‚Äôs population requires significantly less logistical infrastructure than you think.

The other benefit would be close proximity to Australia‚Äôs plentiful lithium resources - a key component in current battery technology. It  currently accounts for more than half of the global production and retains one of the largest national reserves in the world."

"Yeah it would, but we don't know if that will happen. It would be logical to expand the production capacity of Shanghai to export to the local region, but Tesla has said that the Chinese factory is for China only, and they have the demand there to keep it that way."
"Shipping costs are not very expensive. Shipping a 20' container from San Francisco to Melbourne is ~$1200, while shipping the same from Shanghai to Melbourne is ~$700. Saving $500 isn't going to significantly impact the cost of a Model 3, and it'd probably be a bit cheaper if you're shipping them on RoRo vessels.

The tariffs might be dramatically different, in which case a Chinese car could be significantly cheaper, but I have no idea what those rates are."

"Skimming through that report, pretty damning for our energy mix ha. I note that the CO2 data comes from 2013 and I'd like to think we've added a lot more renewables since then. You could also reasonably assume that an EV purchased today would experience lower emissions over it's lifetime as more renewables are brought online and coal plants shut down. Rooftop solar is the fastest way to bring the life cycle emissions down during ownership, and that seems to be ignored. 

They also assume the battery needs to be replaced at 160,000 kms, which I find pretty conservative and definitely not reflective of a Tesla. You could also assume that the battery in a decommissioned EV would be recycled, lowing the production emissions of the next car. As factories and mining operations transition to use more renewable energy will that further reduce production emissions as well? Probably.

The typical figure I've seen quoted is that you only need to drive for 18 months to reach the intersection with ICE, but I guess that is the 60,000km figure from the US in the study. If the car lasts 200,000 kms and gets sold on second hand then that's great. It will only keep offsetting fuel emissions until it dies.

Someone tried to tell me to consider the environmental impact of Lithium mining, but I believe a ramp up of mining minerals for EVs will be offset by a reduction in mining fossil fuels. Plus once a metal is mined it can be recycled, fossil fuel can't. 

I like to play with this US calculator as a sanity check to show that even with heaps of coal in the mix an EV still has lower annual emissions than ICE: https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_emissions.html
If you select Wyoming you get a grid mix that looks a little worse than Aust."
"There are several problems with that study, even if giving it all the generosity in the world:

1: most of the authors are from Mazda's Product Strategy Division. This doesn't mean the study is bad, but that tells you where the study comes from, and gives you a heads-up that **there may be shenanigans afoot**. At the very least if means they may use some incorrect assumptions.

2: ""emissions for replacing the battery with a new one should be added when the lifetime driving distance is over 160,000 km"" **WHERE THE FUCK DOES THIS COME FROM?!!** That's just over 100,000 miles, I've been in EVs that are already well beyond that and a battery replacement isn't considered. *Maybe* that could be a thing for 1st generation Nissan Leaf's, but those have such small batteries that they are in a different ballpark than all other EVs available in Western markets - and even then they are somehow assuming it takes as much CO2 to replace a Leaf's battery as it does to replace a Tesla's. 

3: I could not find a citation to justify the replacement at 160,000 km. The only justification they have is ""The interval for a lithium-ion battery was cited from the warranty distances for a lithium-ion battery of BEVs in the US."" By that same definition - you should replace an ICE at the end of the powertrain warranty too.


They are assuming that the 160k km point on a battery means that it's all used up, no longer viable in any way, and must be landfilled or recycled at best. Aside from that being a completely wrong assumption - that's not even what happens to EV batteries that are replaced. The old cells often go into powerwalls, will be (soon) used for utility-scale power storage, or are used for conversion of other vehicles in which the lower efficiency of an old battery isn't as important.

"Here's the thing. You could argue that had we invested into nuclear tech, we wouldn't have had so many issues with older reactors as we would've had the money to start designing more safer reactors. 

Afaik the only major incidents are Long Island, Fukushima, and Chernobyl. All which are human errors rather than the plant failing. 

It's only waste because we haven't designed anything they can continue to using them. Once again you could argue that had we put more money into nuclear tech, you could've come up with something that continues to use the rods until they're at a much lower radioactivity level(?, Not sure if this is the right word.)"
"Um.... well you see there are plans in motion...

Really we don‚Äôt know. Some of it is being shipped to the refineries that specialize in refining sludge oil, like the Louisiana refineries. But I honestly haven‚Äôt heard what they are going to do with the refuse. Probably export it to 3rd world countries for power production."
Political Stability?
"If they're on the coast, direct pipe out into deep water and circulate the seawater through to keep things cool before releasing the water back out to sea. Could work."

"Aren't those ships mostly traveling due to oil? So that ""free"" ship would not be free after batteries destroy oil...."
"Tesla is already experimenting with ""platooning"" which is basically a road train made up of multiple trucks with one driver."
"I‚Äôll admit I only pulled up the census figures for both nations out of curiosity, and didn‚Äôt notice the contrast in definitions of ‚Äòcity population‚Äô between the two.

Despite that oversight, i stand by my original point that although Australia is a large landmass, you can access more than half the population though a <700mi tunnel between those two cities; and the relative proximity of the natural resources make a strong case to position a Giga Factory there to service the ASEAN region."
Yeh I just grabbed the stats off Google. It didn't seem right to me but had nothing else to compare it to
"As mentioned above, some of the driving distance and battery life estimates might be off. Also I‚Äôm not sure how Australia could be that much worse given their 1.something co2-per-elec unit VS the USA‚Äôs 0.8 something.  

Given the number of studies which say that US coal-powered electric EVs are still better than ICE, all-in, I can‚Äôt see how that seemingly small co2-per-elec delta between the two is enough to tip the scales.  This is horrible not even napkin math and I‚Äôm no expert so am happy to be proven wrong."
Linsell‚Äôs article above captures this point much better than my article
"I'd say EVs are better but at worst on par at the moment. None of these emission comparison graphs account for increasing efficiencies over time, and that's where the EV wins. When you buy an ICE it's efficiency is locked in for its lifetime, but the EV efficiency has flexibility to (most likely) improve over time."
"In nz at least, evs have 60% reduction in CO2 emissions, so there is a big difference between those and petrol cars. Happy to link you to those studies if you want. The benefits are actually understated, as it doesn't take into account recycling and it figures batteries last 10years."
"Not really, no. Not when the comparison requires you to throw out the entire apple after eating only the skin. 

There's nothing in the laws of physics or language that prevents you from trying to compare them. But there is a higher standard than that for a proper study.

It's an utter bullshit comparison, and every reviewer with any credentials should know that. I'm looking up the journal the study was published in - if it was approved for publication at all. I've published to far higher academic scrutiny, and I don't like seeing BS masquerade as a real study."
"You are being very, very generous with those statements. As we see by the fact that someone has already used the study to compare real-world CO2 between vehicles - when in fact the study isn't ""real world"" but is instead ""within warranty (but only for EVs)"" - it has the potential (if not intent) to be misleading, because they know most non-researchers will read the title and a few lines, and not know what to look for. 

And my criticism for the author's backgrounds isn't the fact they are in a product strategy division; it's the fact that it is at Mazda - which doesn't have any EVs or hybrids, and didn't announce plans for any until long after the study was published. If the authors were from Tesla, I'd look at it with the same harshness but from the other side, and expect that they would make pro-EV assumptions which need to be justified. Imagine if Tesla funded a study that said EVs last 10 times as long as ICE's, but included the caveat that this is only true if you never change the ICE engine oil. If anything, it's a more valid assumption than the warranty limitation on this study, as it could say the study assumed that no engine maintenance is ever performed - because that assumption would be applied to both cars (and just so happens to favor EVs because they generally don't need engine maintenance), whereas in the example study the warranty limitation was applied to EVs but not ICEs which tend to have an even shorter powertrain warranty.


Let's put it this way: Mazda announced a plug-in hybrid a few months ago. Do you think they'll openly say that the battery is completely used up and wasted by 160k km? I don't; they may only extend the warranty that long, but they certainly won't have their dealers schedule people for complete battery replacement once that mileage ticks over. They know that the battery will outlast that.

And they have no ""well we didn't know"" excuse - they published a study on it, they made it their business to know this.  By offering it for publication, they assert that they know the subject - or at least their very narrow scope of the study - at least as well as the other people who have studied this. If they didn't, then wtf are they doing by presenting a study? You don't publish to the academic literature for the fun of it, that's why there are gatekeeping functions, to keep the signal-to-noise ratio as good as possible - and it's why this study was published to an online-only journal rather than a more respected and recognized one."
"Ah ok, thanks üôè"
Can't you just crack the HFO to produce more lighter oils?
"I'm not an expert on the history of it, but there was (and still is) plenty of money spent on Nuclear (operations and research).  And it's not just accidents (although a major Nuclear accident every 10 years isn't great either), but long-lived waste, and the sheer expensive and time involved in building them don't help either.

And we have a number of reactor designs that are waste burning or fast breeders that burn up the long lived antecedents.  Some of the Gen IV waste burning molten salt designs could have demonstration plants build by 2026.

I'm still not sure we are anywhere near where I'd want one of these on a ship for commercial use.  I think they'd be better used to power non-fossil methane generation or hydrogen splitting, and just run the ships with fuel cells (the recent ceramic designs in the labs are notably more efficient and robust)."
Any business really
That's specifically talking about *orbit*. I'm talking about leaving Earth's gravity well entirely (e.g. going to mars). Those are completely different tasks.
Source for this?
"Honestly, You'll get your Gigafactory sometime within the next 15 years. *But*, it'll be after China, the US, and the EU get a terafactory or two."
"Not sure which one you mean. The one they listed was just about emissions wasnt it? not a lifecycle analysis?

Anyway, not sure why these analyses are so far off. Even the us numbers. 6 month vs 4 years payoff is a big difference.

I haven‚Äôt found anything about the co2 payoff timeline for grid storage batteries like the big one they installed in Australia. If you have any sources for that info I‚Äôd like to read them."
"Maybe so. Economics can sometimes produce counterintuitive results though. What‚Äôs shitty is that the co2 is all spent up front. And then maybe paid back over the life of the car. Do we know how many battery replacements have happened under warrantee so far? Because each one is like manufacturing a whole new car in terms of co2. And while battery recycling is great for the materials, what‚Äôs the energy cost of that?    Do we know?"
"I‚Äôm convinced by a lot of your comments and skepticism, but I think the assumption about the life of the battery is meaningless. It‚Äôs explicitly stated. It‚Äôs visible in the data. They aren‚Äôt using it as a factor to make any recommendations. They are just putting it in the charts."
"Not my field. But as I understand it HFO is what‚Äôs left after you crack everything you can out of oil. A few refineries like the Louisiana ones can get more out of it, but even they are still left with some sludge at the end of processing."
Then you want to go in the direction the earth spins AND in the direction the earth travels around the sun. Adding even more free speed.
"Escape velocity is greater than orbital velocity and does not change based on where you lift-off from.  It sounded to me like you did not understand that to just get to orbit you have to go really fast.  Actually leaving the planet you have to go even faster than that.

But sorry if I educated you on this. I didn't mean to teach you a new concept."
"You *could* theoretically go straight up,but it's the worst possible option and we can't build rocket efficient enough to do it. They way it is done is to reach orbit and accelerate sideways until you travel so fast that Earth's gravity can't hold you back. You still move basically straight up, there's little difference, but it's much more efficient."
At the semi reveal Elon talked about the drag co. and the economics of having a ‚Äúfleet‚Äù slipstreaming. I think they might be referring to that.
"Perhaps I was a little ahead of myself there, but I did read shortly after the semi was announced that they had got permission (or was seeking permission) to do some trials in Utah/Nevada.

Obviously, they can't actually ***do*** any platooning until they have some trucks to do it with...it would make sense as an interim stage before FSD on the semi. It would also be useful as an energy saver for groups of FSD trucks. I believe one of the other ICE truck manufacturers did a demo of it in Europe about a year ago, with drivers on board of course.

Australia would be perfect for it of course."
I think there have been some battery replacements in older Model Ss. No idea how many. The plan would be remove the cells from a used car battery and pack them into a stationary powerwall or power pack for reuse.
"Shortening diesel to gasoline is possible so surely shortening HFO to diesel should be possible.

Probably not worth it economically but still possible."
"So I looked this up to try to solve whatever was preventing me from figuring out why everyone has a different opinion you than me. And this image finally explained it:

https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/launch-windows/launchdiagram_anim.en.gif"
"Yeah, going to the ISS or going to Mars is basicly the same thing, just different speeds."
"Wow, thanks for being a condescending prick. That *really* helped me learn."
"Yeah, I figured that out down-thread. I understand why I was wrong, now."
"Well they better be coming up with plan b uses for those million mile batteries. I mean it would be nice to think that people would keep driving their cars for a million miles, but then tesla and every other car company would go bankrupt."
Well.. technically you could burn the HFO capture the exhaust then turn the exhaust gas directly into gasoline. It just costs an arm and a leg (you can do this with any hydrocarbon).
"Yes, that's looking straight down on a pole, and you can see how that launch is taking advantage of both the earths spin and its direction around the sun."
Side note. Model Y efficiency at 4.1 miles per KWH means 400+ miles range with 100kwh battery. Woo!
This is brilliant.  I thought the size difference was more subtle seeing them separately but like this it's striking.
It seems the top is taller than model 3 by almost same amount as the increase in ground clearance. I am confused. I am going to patiently wait to measure it with my own measuring tape before configuring.
The 3 is longer?
"These are from the updated side profile images from Tesla‚Äôs Model Y and 3 product pages, that have the current production wheel offerings for both Performance models.

I‚Äôve tried to match the scale of both cars as much as possible, using these common components as reference: charge port, door handles, and side autopilot cameras.

I found it handy to use Preview on Mac to go through each frame in the GIF individually.

Higher res image: [https://i.imgur.com/6ktDa0e.gif](https://i.imgur.com/6ktDa0e.gif)"
Y looks so good too... At least in this color üòª
"I'd like to see the Y's interior, especially rear seat foot well and cargo space (with and wo seats folded). The only thing I've realized is less than ideal in my 3 is when I have taller people in it.

I'm short so it works great for me, but I had two tall guys in there last week and it was a contest between the passenger seat moving back and still being able to fit the guy's skis behind it."
good luck to those in the 3rd row.
It would dope if they made a minivan
I've seen Y in person and it just looks weird to me.  But for people that need more space it seems like a fine option.
Would love to see it vs the CR-V and RAV4
they seriously just panamera'd that bitch huh
Same length it seems. Would be nice if they added a few inches in length for that 7 seater
"The model Y looks like the models 3s fat brother, lol"
"It's important to note here that they are comparing the Performance versions of both cars. It is stated on Tesla's site that the Performance version of the Model Y has a lowered suspension, so I would expect the non-performance version of the Y to be 1-2 inches taller than whats shown in this comparison photo."
So tempted to trade my 3 for a Y and Tesla quoted me $44k trade in for my AWD!!! But if the 100kwh rumors are true... I want to wait.
"Honestly the M3 looks sexy, unlike the MY. Lol However, wife likes slightly bigger utility vehicles so we ordered the MY instead.."
[deleted]
They're going to sell so many
Can someone do this with the addition of Model S and Model X please.
I'm excited for it!
can someone add cybertruck to that?
"Thank you for putting this together!  We have a reservation for the Y and was trying to show wife how much taller the Y is compared to the 3.  It's nuts that it has the same efficiency as the 3, but it doesn't surprise me."
"I sure hope this is correct (and it seems to be an accurate representation). I wanted a shorter Model Y. Initial reports were that it's 190"" long, which is, IMHO, too long for the small parking spaces in my area. If it's 181"", that's vastly better, especially with the large interior spaces that have been shown.

Can't wait to take delivery!"
Come on TSLA stock! Another couple thousand bucks a share and I'll be able to afford a Y!
Teslas have the nicest wheels.
And yet people remain in denial that the 3 and Y are the same length.
Any word on towing capacity?
But what about the trunk clearance? And does it open like a 5 door hatchback or is it a trunk?
Pretty sure the Y is actually longer than the 3.
"Awesome comparison, any chance of updating it with the Cybertruck?"
"Is the wheel base actually that different?  I was expecting them to be the same, but I suppose it makes sense that the Y would have larger wheels.  Considered that Tesla wanted to use as many components between the 2 cars as possible, it surprises me that the front wheel of the Y is more forward than on the 3 -- this implies a different bed on the 2 cars, which means different sizes of things, etc.

Great comparison for size, though.  Really makes me look forward to getting my Y now.

I still have to wait another 2+ years, though, before the RHD version is available."
Anyone know the trunk space with the seats up?
Looks ugly? From that perspective at least. Reminds me of the Honda HR-V.
Interesting they use the same rear bumper
These are great wallpapers!
Nice. I skipped Model 3 because it seemed juuuust a bit too small for me.
What‚Äôs the deal with pre-ordering a Y? How much do I need to put down? Anyone got any tips? I love how it looks in this image
I really dislike the new wheels. They seem so weird to me. Anyone else?
"is the back of model y hatchback? my family runs a business and sometimes we need the whole backside space to put a lot of boxes and move

how much space would the model y have compared to kia sorento?"
I still can‚Äôt visualize a 3rd row of seats in this car. Really hope they share interior photos soon.
Can you do me a 3 Vs Cybertruck Vs Y? Please?!
The Model Y will sell like crazy if they can cut the price by about 3-5k.
What? There will be a model Y with a <250wh/mi rating? That would surprise me considering the 250 wh/mi rating of the model 3.
"I haven‚Äôt heard anything about 100 kWh battery, are they going to do that?"
Y is getting 100kWh?
When do we get the 100 kwh battery?  I'd trade my 3 in today for that one.
"The heavier battery would decrease efficiency quite drastically. Should be better than the Model S‚Äôs 380 miles, but we can‚Äôt be sure it will break 400 miles. 

Also confirmed that they would rather sell more cars with smaller batteries, so that‚Äôs not happening. Investing in getting enough superchargers so that nobody would care about 400+ mile battery would be preferable."
Is the 100kwh battery a rumor? or will that happen?
So would the Model 3s have the new 100kwh battery ?
[deleted]
"I saw one yesterday. At first glance I thought it was an X. Then I looked at it and was confused as to why this X looked different. Then I realized that it was a Y. I have an X and a 3, so I am able to compare the sizes between the 2 all the time. The Y is definitely closer to X size than 3 size."
"I‚Äôve noticed that in the light, the Y looks small and like a 3. In the dark, it looks like an X.

I think it‚Äôs because the styling is so similar to the 3 that if you can really see it, your brain kinda tricks you into thinking it‚Äôs smaller."
Also see my other image comparison for the front differences in https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/ez0ulf/model_y_and_model_3_current_wheel_choices/
"Ground clearance is not that different between Y and 3, but it‚Äôs much taller as seen on the public road pictures from others. It‚Äôs hard to see the Y‚Äôs bottom black trim moulding on a phone or the reddit low qual image due to black levels getting crushed but try the high-res image I posted on a quality monitor and you‚Äôll see."
"The Y body is noticeably, weirdly I might say, taller than the 3. Take a picture of a 3. Resize it vertically by (I'm guessing here) 20%, and that's how it looks in person."
It‚Äôs not uncommon for sedans to be slightly longer than their hatchback counterparts.
Don't think so. No way can they fit a 3rd row if it is shorter than the 3. In fact I feel it might be a little longer than the 3.
"No

EDIT: Obviously the Model 3 is longer in this visualization. Never assume sarcasm translates well to text! My bad."
You should take the model Y with the 20‚Äù wheels and match it with the performance 3 20‚Äù wheels to get an accurate scale.
White is better
"Since they are almost the exact same length, you can expect them to have similar sized footwells."
3rd row is for in-laws
One word: cyberminivan
That World be the Model X.
"There was a NYT article last year about the decline of the minivan.  I didn't realize how few are still in production.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/business/drive-a-minivan.html"
"I'm the opposite. I feel after looking at the Y, it feels it has the correct proportions for the 3's design. They're gonna sell a boat load of these!"
That‚Äôs how I feel about the 3 looks.
"Reports have shown that the non-performance Model Y's in the wild are nearly identical to the heights of the CR-V and Rav4 (performance Model Y's suspension lowered a few inches).

Interior space is also similar to the Rav4, and slightly smaller than the CR-V."
Someone else posted a comment with a comparison directly from teslas website(similar to how this one was done) and it showed that the y was definitely longer. The OP on this post claims to have taken it from teslas website too but I think they just did a poor job and people upvoted it because it looks good but don't realize it's inaccurate.
What 100 kWh rumors??
"To each their own. In this gif the MY looks very Jaguar E Pace-like, which is a good thing to me."
Their suspensions are not the same ;)
"RIP

It was a short squeeze, and people riding on Q4 hype. Nothing about that growth was sustainable, and the sell off is big.

Edit: It‚Äôs down to $715 (10:50 PST) from $961 yesterday."
It was $2500 but looks like it is only $100 now.  [https://www.tesla.com/modely/design#payment](https://www.tesla.com/modely/design#payment)
 Efficiency improvements look substantial enough for this to make sense. The rated range is similar for both the 3 and the Y despite their differences.
It was confirmed in the Q4 letter in the chart on page 8: https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/b3cf7f5e-546a-4a65-9888-c928b914b529
My understanding is that M3 needs 220 wh/MI to get the rated 250m range for sr+
"220 Wh/mi for model 3 Lr rwd. Wonder if model 3 will get a bump like S, X, and Y did."
the 3 is now rated at 255wh/mi
There was a rumour on Twitter by the reliable greentheonly which mentioned software information for a possible 100kwh battery for 3/Y
[deleted]
"It was left over in some code, it's unlikely we will see it anytime soon, if ever.  They probably can't add 30% more batteries to the existing pack.  Frankly they don't need it, and financially it doesn't make sense today as batteries are expensive the limit their production.  It would make more sense to take the efficiencies found in the Model Y and apply them to the 3 (which I suspect will happen soon)."
"if tesla decided. my comment wasn't to imply I know its coming, just that.. the efficiency is already there, so they could if they wanted to."
"Not everyone lives in California, 400 miles for me would mean going ICE free. The 300 Mile limit means I can't do some work trips sure to range limitations"
"Unnecessary for you, important for me.  At 300 miles of range in winter I‚Äôd be sweating bullets trying to make a round trip drive to my preferred ski resort, which has no public L2 chargers to top up while skiing and no superchargers along the drive.  400 miles and I have no range anxiety.  It‚Äôs also the difference of being able to skip a supercharging stop on a 400-mile trip in cold weather.  More range for me please."
"I would love the extra range.  I frequently run into sticky situations with my model 3 AWD.  And lets be honest, it may be rated for 320 miles, but it only does 260... MAx in good conditions, I try to never plan over 220 miles.  when weather is bad and and you are supercharging so you don't want to go over 60% your effective range gets down in the 130 mile range.    so yea, a bigger battery would be great."
"It actually just might be the very opposite of what you predict. A single number (range) that customers can use to guide decisions. All other numbers become irrelevant. The new EV word where each customer knows what they can expect from the car due to reliability, efficiency and low maintenance. Unlike, ICE, where these things are volatile and unbeknownst to the consumer at the same level."
"I agree. And while right now, people see the need for 400+ miles, once there are enough superchargers, nobody would care for 300 vs 400 miles of range. It‚Äôs better for them to focus on charging infrastructure expansion while being able to pump out more vehicles with smaller batteries."
"It‚Äôs remarkable how ‚Äúhuge‚Äù the Y seems alone on the highway imo, only to realize that model 3 is quite big too lol. I still get a bit amazed about how massive the X is tho, always thought it looked so much smaller in pictures.."
"Looking at this front comparison, made me wonder if the funk was bigger?"
Why is it weird for a SUV to have a taller body than a sedan?
squished down
"Model Y isn't a typical hatchback though, it's an SUV. And it is uncommon if a 3 row of seats car is shorter than a 2 row car, hatch or not."
"I agree, I don't think the scale comparison is accurate if they think the wheel base is the same.

Edit: Did my own gif using images straight from Tesla site, assuming they are using correct scale and it seems to be since the headlights remain unchanged for both cars. Model Y is noticeably longer and bigger car: https://i.imgur.com/munq9T4.gif"
"I mean if you look at this comparison it is in fact slightly longer, however it seems like just the bumper is longer."
"This is not sarcasm. This animation is probably wrong, Y is supposed to be slightly larger."
"You really need to add a /s if you are going to use sarcasm on here.  Sarcasm rarely translates through text alone.  In speech there are inflections and other cues that allow someone to pick up that you are being sarcastic.  All of these are lost in text.  Sarcasm in text is possible, but difficult."

Green on Twitter found some code referencing a 100kwh model 3 and ludicrous mode as well
Where's the efficiency coming from? Is it battery/motor related or aerodynamic?
Yaa after the updation in model the efficiency is really improved.
That‚Äôs nuts
"Note this chart doesn't take into account charging losses, because EPA numbers for the e-tron and i-pace are a lot lower than what Tesla noted here."
That sweeping big cast piece  in the rear wheel well looks guuuurrd
The rating I referenced is for the model 3 stealth
"It kind of did with an OTA update, they improved power efficiency but didn‚Äôt update the rated efficiency. I get <250 when driving with the AC off if it‚Äôs in the 50‚Äôs."
Data point: I have a 2018 Model 3 LR RWD and am on 2020.4.1. My lifetime avg has been creeping upwards to 246 Wh/mi over 22k miles and nearly 2 years. During first year my avg was 237 Wh/mi. My commute is short and I don‚Äôt drive it like I stole it. I charge at home to 90% when it drops near 20%. And have only taken a handful of road trips over 400 mi. I don‚Äôt see anywhere close to 220 Wh/mi on local roads or on road trips and I live in a warm climate
Mine most certainly is rated at 250. Would be surprised if another one is higher because I have the stealth version.
"This is still probably a few years off, also we don't know if the truck, roadster, or Model S/X battery might be 150-200kWh. The truck is supposed to have 500-mile range and roadster is supposed to have 621-mile range.

150kWh can supercharge at 469kWh, 200kWh can supercharge at 625kW."
I hope Tesla doesn't go out of their way to hold back the 3 / Y or any mass produced vehicles they make while they upgrade the S / X and high-end vehicles.
Maybe they already did and the ratings were not updated. I remember reading a statement from Elon that Model S is over it's rated miles already but they just didn't do the recertification that are needed to update the estimates
Same boat here. 300 miles is big iffy territory. When it‚Äôs 15 degrees out that becomes problem territory.
"It's not a 300 mile ""limit.""

How long do you spend at gas stations on that 400 mile drive?  7 minutes?  That's how long it takes to put 100 miles in a Tesla on a 250kW supercharger.  Meanwhile you can save maybe $10k in battery costs, or 4 cars can be made with 300 mile batteries for every 3 cars that are made with 400 mile batteries - getting 30% more gas cars off the road."
">https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/b3cf7f5e-546a-4a65-9888-c928b914b529

I absolutely agree. 400 is needed for massive US adoption."
This is true. Cars lose more range when it's cold.i would email your ski resort and ask them to put in charging stations
[deleted]
In what regards is the model 3 big? It looks the same size as most other sedans.
Yes it's much deeper
Nothing about SUVs in general. The Y looks like a bowler hat to me.
I‚Äôm more inclined to call it a CSUV than an SUV (the X being midsized). The 3rd row option isn‚Äôt standard and will eat at the cargo space considerably.
"I really hope someday we get an actual Model 3 Hatch. I'm not a fan of that taller profile the Y has. Keep it low like the 3 but a hatch instead of a trunk, please."
Personally I much prefer black than chrome.I find it gives a more dynamic and sporty mean look.
Agree!
[How about this?](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Tesla_Model_Y_passenger_side_view.jpg/1200px-Tesla_Model_Y_passenger_side_view.jpg)
I disagree with your prediction based on the fact that one Model Y weighs more than a ton.
"everything ... better battery heating and cooling, better HVAC, better aerodynamics (relative to size), motor efficencies, less weight per volume of car. Each small % makes gains. 

Tesla is a company built on getting the most out of every design because when they did the model S it was $$$$ to buy batteries, so efficency was the name of the game, but car makers today would rather spend $2k more on a bigger battery than optimize for a smaller battery in KWH."
"One of Biggest difference is going to be amount of wiring in car. 

Model 3 has 1.5 I'm of wires

Model y target was 100 meters"
yes You are right. I am agree with you.
"I also have a 2018 M3 LR RWD and my lifetime avg. is 222 Wh/mi and I'm in CA.

Edit: I have the 19in sport wheels."
Plaid Model S will have a bigger battery. Roadster battery is 200kwh confirmed.
Doubtful. The 3/Y is what will keep them profitable.
He did say that on the last earnings call.  He didn't mention the Model 3 though...
"A supercharger can give you over 100 miles in 15 minutes. (including pulling up to the station, parking, and getting back on your route) so I'd you ever have to lease and drive say 450 miles, a 20 minute break will give you more than enough juice to keep moving"
"How many superchargers are there in your area? The closest one that‚Äôs open to the public is over 7 miles away, and nothing I‚Äôve seen is over 72 kW unless I‚Äôm gonna spend 45 minutes and 25 miles driving to charge, and even then it‚Äôs 150 kW not 250. 
For me the extra 100 mile range would do a lot to cover the times I need to go further, at least for peace of mind, because my area I can‚Äôt just stop for 7 minutes and get the extra miles off a charger."
"300 miles isn't 300 miles in winter.  300 miles isn't 300 miles if you have to arrive with 5-10% range as a safety margin.  300 miles isn't 300 miles in mountainous terrain.  300 miles isn't 300 miles with a bike or skis on the roof, or driving 75-80 mph on the interstate (which is the speed limit around here).  300 miles becomes 200 miles or less really easily in the real world outside of Southern California where superchargers are fewer and further between.  400- or even 500-mile quoted range would make the difference for me between having to keep an ICE as a second car and going ICE-free."

"American, eh? For most of Europeans, Model 3 is considered a quite large car. Not huge, but definitely not compact."
"Size is all relative. Perhaps they're used to smaller coupes/hatchbacks and so any sedan for that matter they deem ""quite big"". Just putting some perspective in their rationale."
Deep funk
"I have nothing supporting that hypothesis, but if they'd offer bioweapon defense mode with a slightly smaller frunk as a tradeoff, I'd be super willing to pay extra for that üòç"
This would be my dream 3.
"No, I was referring to the black striping around the wheel arches and the doors (forget what it's called). I like the chrome delete too"
Applying Moore's Law (of a sort) to cars: genius.
Has there been any word on the Model 3 line being updated to include the improvements from the Model Y line?
"Also in CA, lifetime 225 Wh/mi, 40K miles."
I'd be thrilled with that kind of efficiency lol. I'm at about 310 avg at 25k miles 2018 AWD on 19s. Chicago.
Even elon said the X/S are nostalgia projects at this point.
That‚Äôs assuming that there are superchargers where they have to go for work.
"Unfortunately I live in an area that was picked for the nuclear program during WWII precisely because it is desolate, and I often enough have to work with others, meaning I can‚Äôt just say, sorry, let me detour to the one supercharger along our route, I‚Äôll just be 30-40 minutes late to our next stop."
"That‚Äôs assuming you aren‚Äôt traveling on a holiday, and the line for superchargers is 1/4 mile long."

"I hate that you are getting downvoted for facts. Plenty of people agree with you but a lot of people don't like being told tesla isn't perfect for everyone and they downvote. Range is very important.

If I were to take a trip to the beach in my car then I could make it down there with only one stop for gas at around the half tank mark at any number of gas stations littered down the highway. And wouldn't need to worry about having to plug in when I'm down there. It would take about 5 hours with no traffic which is the usual.

With the tesla m3 long range it would take an extra 30 minutes according to the trip planner. If I had the standard range it would take an extra hour and change. (Roughly been a bit since the last time I looked). This was with ideal weather conditions and leaving with a full battery. Luckily I doubt there would be lines at any of the chargers because teslas aren't as popular out here. But they also aren't right off the interstate so there's more likelihood of traffic causing a bigger slowdown. Plus I then would have to plan my stay for places I can charge and last time I went there wasn't one at the place I was at. So clearly an ev would be a pain in the ass to own right now for me. I'm sure others have scenarios that are worse and need that 400 mile range minimum. Especially in the winter when range can drop 30%"

"Yeah it amuses me when the 3 is described as small - it *just* would fit in my garage, notably bigger than most normal cars here in the uk!"
"And I wasn‚Äôt saying it was small, just not huge. It‚Äôs smaller than a Camry which is an average sedan in America. I used to live in Italy in the 90s so I‚Äôm quite familiar with small euro cars."
"I am planning to use the extra frunk capacity install 2 ultra capacitors hooked up to regen lines and drive a 65kW laser with a led charge indicator running across my dash. I am planning to attach the focus lenses to a few solenoids so I can fire a scribe beam at peoples bumpers. The messages will be coded on a small DJ button pannel mounted next to my phone charger. Here is an example of one of the choices: ‚Äúplease use your blinker when you change lanes‚Äù. The cool part is that it takes less than a second to etch and they will find the message when they get to their destination.
This setup is perfect because when stupid shit happens on the road I usually slow down and this will charge the capacitors and get them ready to fire. I can also chose font based on their make and model to keep in line with design esthetics."
"Even better: Cyber Model 3 Hatch. I'm solidly in the ""I think the Cybertruck looks awesome"" camp, though. :)"
Plastic cladding
Software updates but no hardware confirmed
"Sucks for you currently, all the more reason to push for more electric infrastructure. If ICE and ev's came out at the same time, people would be like WOW, these ICE cars suck.   


There is just more infrastructure set up for ICE cars"
Right but it still beats having an ICE or a non Tesla
The main point I was trying to get at was my area doesn‚Äôt have a big infrastructure of charging places  set up yet so I‚Äôd be interested in something that could get a little better range to open up my options a little more.

"Underrated comment, very good!!"
Stop I can only get so erect.
This excites me
"Problem with unpainted textured moulding is that scratches can't be buffed out, or painted, like  normal panels. Ask me how I know lol."
"I agree entirely. I want an ev. Badly. But between the former concerns and the fact that I would need a replacement for my company gas card makes it a little hard to switch. 

I was in college a decade ago doing presentations about the smart grid, and ev batteries being potential grid storage."
[deleted]
"No it's not. For one that assumes you have a garage or way to charge at home or work, not everyone can.

So if you don't have that it changes your day and gives you anxiety. I had to drive 80 miles yesterday and I was concerned I would not make it. That fear is real. Stop telling people range anxiety isn't real. 

Not everyone lives in a big city with a plethora of open chargers"

"I was a picky kid so quattro formaggio was my go to, but I actually loved gnocchi which in the south was almost always a simple dish with the dumplings, tomato sauce and mozzarella baked in the oven."
I need an adult!
"A regular 400mi work trip and without the time to supercharge isn‚Äôt the norm either. Trying to accommodate this very small group of people is difficult at this time and probably isn‚Äôt something Tesla is trying to accommodate. I‚Äôm fairly sure if Tesla breaks the 400mi mark, you‚Äôll find someone here saying it‚Äôs not enough for some unique situation."
"Again, not all areas in the us are well served by superchargers. I've put over 35k miles on my Model 3 with several 1000+ mile trips with no problem. My issue is day trips for work to semi remote/rural areas is tough with 300 miles of range. During the winter with the range penalties it's just not practical to take the Model 3 so I still need an ICE car to accomplish these trips. For me personally 400 miles of range would be enough to go pure EV. Your bad posting should stop."

"I'm 100% certain you'll see that.  Everyone is looking for some .0001% case, and even in those cases, the car is still capable, they just don't want to think of how it's capable.  Even 300 is beyond enough for the vast majority of people.  Less than 300 is."

"I have 2 Y reservations, a LR RWD(4/20/19) and PYD(10/31/19). Havent gotten an email yet but I was contacted 3 times over the last 3 weeks from my local service center about my RWD version, and was told over the phone I was looking at june delivery for RWD. (East coast)"
"Was just about to post saying this because I just received an email for March Delivery.

March 15 was earliest delivery listed for me. Not sure how to attach screenshot...
I got one as well. Model Y Performance in Blue. Located in Utah.
So does this mean it‚Äôs also good news for people like me who are in the market to buy a used model 3 this year?
got my email  [https://imgur.com/a/5CWs7cG](https://imgur.com/a/5CWs7cG) not planning on taking delivery till may or june
Received as well. I was surprised because I had ordered on January 4.
"Can confirm, I also received one! I ordered a PYD on October 27."
Wonder when they‚Äôll be in Tesla stores to check out in person. Must be soon right?
Guess I‚Äôll read this thread for the 5th time today.
"I had a friend share a screenshot of their email. I'm excited for everyone on the list getting a Y! Congratulations everybody getting one in this first batch, and a HUGE congratulations to Tesla for getting this car out 6 months before their initial target, and a full quarter before their ""optimistic"" target."
[deleted]
"Oh man. I just put my preorder in a couple weeks ago for a LR .

Can't wait for my turn on this."
Anyone want to buy my model 3 lol
"You fuckin assholes, Ive been waiting 6 weeks for a M3, and it looks like I'll be waiting at least another 3. I hate you all (not really, just jealous)."
"GOT IT! 
AWD (non-P), 20"" Induction, Black Interior, FSD.
Louisiana.
Ordered around New Year.
March Delivery!"
It's happening! Just got my email as well!
I hope this means more Model 3s popping up in the used market this summer.
"So, is it safe to assume that once these model Ys start getting delivered we can see more used model 3s start hitting the market? I'm waiting to pick up a used model 3 but I'm getting really tired of seeing used model 3s selling for more than what they would cost brand new.."
"Anyone not get an email but login to their account and it actually walks you through the entire process of delivery address/payment/etc but not choosing a date?

It just says ‚ÄúPrepare for Delivery‚Äù"
I ordered a performance model on 2/19.  I‚Äôm also an owner of an S and an X and live in Las Vegas. I got the email.
\*cries in European\*
so jealous
Doea this mean they'll be on display in March too?
[deleted]
"I got the confirmation email and picked my delivery date. MYP, grey / black 5 seat performance and i‚Äôve gotta ask for some help here.. 
have you guys been super underwhelmed dealing with Tesla sales? spent about an hour on chat, email and phone this am in an attempt to answer a couple of basic questions. 
1- performance upgrade says it has lowered suspension, how much lower? 
2- wheel options are 19‚Äù gemini or 21‚Äù uberturbine, can i get the 20‚Äù induction wheels instead? 
So far i‚Äôve encountered, ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know, call roadside assistance.‚Äù wait, what?!?!?
One sales guy says, ‚Äú it‚Äôs not really lowered, it just looks that way‚Äù 
the next sales guy says it‚Äôs lowered 3‚Äù! 3 inches lower is massive! 
does anyone at this company who is public facing know what the ef they‚Äôre talking about? it‚Äôs 3 weeks til pickup and they want a finalized order but these are major decisions that could really use a fact check"
"If anyone is getting delivery soon and wants to sell their order, message me."
As a 3 owner i wanna drive one to see how different of a driving experience it is
Everyone. Did you go for the white interior or the black for the Y? I went with white
"Anyone know if the Y will be in their show rooms?  No showroom where I'm from, but I'll be in Cali a few times next month.  Would love to sit in one."
"Ordered on Jan 30th, Performance (no red calips version). **Did not** receive email & I live in the Bay Area."
"Now white interiors (performance and Non-performance) are waiting. 

AWD white interior here, no email."
"Got my email today! Mine is AWD, not performance. Very excited!"
"My LR RWD states prepare for delivery on my Tesla page, does every one have this?"
"My LR AWD Black/black, no fsd, non-performance says preparing for delivery now"
"Dang. I pre-ordered 3/15/2019 for a Model Y Performance and didn't get an email. I am hoping I receive one soon. Congrats to everyone who did get the email. This is pretty exciting. I guess it doesn't matter your pre-order position, but instead the performance and then geographic location it seems."
"Some data point:

I ordered on earnings day (few weeks back), Performance model Y. Live close to factory. Currently own a Performance 3 and model S."
Have any of these orders been AWD? I‚Äôm assuming they are all performance at this point?
Is anyone in Denver that‚Äôs taking delivery in March? I‚Äôd love to see yours when it gets here! I‚Äôm dying to see one in person.
"If we confirm our available dates, can we still modify things like seat color?"
What a lovely surprise to get in the morning.
Please have the 7-seater ready by September?
"Interesting note, they are doing deliveries a year to the date from when they unveiled the car. Unreal!"
[deleted]
"I look forward to finally test driving a model Y. I want to get one, but at 6'7"" I need to make sure I fit comfortably before committing to anything."
Hopefully this means pre orders in Australia are closer to opening (and getting an idea on pricing).
Anyone in Texas get an email?
"Received my email, i am non-performance LR AWD!

Red with upgraded wheels and FSD"
Is anyone with a delivery date asking about the tow hitch option?  I'd like to hear about that :)
Wow it‚Äôs finally happening!!
really hope the quality issues of the first wave of Y's is much better than the 3 launch.. if it's looking like there are some major issues I may postpone my delivery :( (will be trading in my 3 from Aug '18)
I saw one driving in Saratoga this weekend. Seems like employee deliveries may have started.
Ooo... Before the end of Q1.
"Solved: Viewing it on my phone worked, but not with Chrome on laptop.

FYI: The Confirmation asks for dates in March you can‚Äôt take delivery (March 15-31), else the option is to take delivery anyday

anyone else having this issue? I click on the link in the email to confirm my reservation. I‚Äôm taken to what looks like a broken Tesla page, telling me in plain HTML with some plain links, ""This reservation is not owned by this account"".

It‚Äôs my reservation, my account, and my email. I did preorder way late around early Feb."
Looks like in the comment section of the article the earliest delivery option was March 15th. Are we expecting a delivery day type event where all of the final dimensions/features are announced?
Performance white Maryland ! Edit: ordered early feb
Is this only for performance version? I‚Äôm wondering about the LR AWD
Excited for everyone getting their performance Y. Can't wait for my LR!
"I just received my email this morning, confirming March delivery. I ordered Performance model on Jan 29

Edit: I‚Äôm in San Francisco. White."
"Did anyone get an email that was a very early pre-order for the performance? I was wondering if you ever changed the order details to include the performance package or not. I am not sure if I can make that change, or should make that change. I am going to try and call Tesla, but I figured that someone might have figured this issue out. I pre-ordered day one, but I am afraid to make any changes to my order. I thought once they selected me, I would then configure the final settings on the car including the performance package. Any input would be great!!"
"Here‚Äôs the answers to what I‚Äôve been asked hundreds of times: 

2/7/20 ordered: First time owner, Tesla Model Y Performance with Performance upgrade. Black interior, no FSD. I have a CyberTruck on order. I also test drove the Model 3 at the show room. Delivery is in the Seattle area around 15 March."
LR AWD here... Just got my email.
[deleted]
"According to Tesla Daily, only black interiors are getting the e-mails."
"So yesterday I was reading with ENVY of folks getting this email, so this morning, I received the same email as well asking me to confirm March delivery.

LR,AWD,White paint/Dark leather/FSD/So.Cal/3rd day reservation holder

maybe it helped move me up when I got some TSLA shares yesterday while it was down, maybe not/ I do not care, but am very happy !"
"I received the email this morning.   I went into my order, and changed the color of the car from grey to black.  The price went up by $2k.  I guess this was a complete noob mistake?  Is there a recourse for me here?   I think I would change back to grey to save the $2k.   Evidently I lost my place in line as well.   I guess I should have read first.. this was super unexpected."
"i saw a white model Y in my neighborhood yesterday

Have they been released?"
Do they... Tell you the interior dimensions of the car ? Still no info on this which feels odd. Does Tesla not have a tape measure?
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôve had my M3P on order since Jan 16... and just today got a text message telling me my delivery is between 4-6 weeks from today.  It‚Äôs been a loooong wait.
Anyone outside the US?

Job satisfaction for the person hitting Send on these emails must be through the roof now
Hahah I‚Äôm ‚Äúthe guy‚Äù. What would you like to know?
"I‚Äôm so confused now!!!   It was so much easier when only Performance versions being produced.  I got the email last night, but it doesn‚Äôt say for which one!!  Ordered LR AWD Blue/Black, FSD in June last year for the wife.   Ordered Performance White/Black, FSD for myself last month.   Email nor the order page says anything about which one scheduled for delivery next month!   

I know poor me!!  First world problems!!  üò©üòè"
Any idea if I switch my order for performance without third row would help in getting one earlier? I ordered the LR white Model Y with third row.
"Seems only performance orders are getting emails. And most likely orders with colors Blue and White, it seems. Doesn‚Äôt matter when the order was placed or where in US. 

I have a Blue AWD with no email yet, for some data."
Anyone know if changing the color of the car puts you back of the queue?  I originally reserved March 20th last year and I‚Äôd had to be out in the back of line by changing colors.
Any news on when leasing will be available?
Any mention of financing/leasing?
Time for another piece of the puzzle of E.V. and automobile market domination.
Has anyone ordered one from the UK or Europe and received a message?
Is it the size if the model x or is it somewhere in between
What is the best option to choose anytime or first available date on the calendar March 15? In chicago.
"I'm excited to start seeing these on the road! I hope they sell well. For a while I wasn't sure they were differentiated enough from Model 3, but after seeing the cargo area with the lift gate open, I believe the Y will provide a distinct enough offering to the 3. It definitely provides a lot more cargo area.

Has anyone sat in the back seat of one? (2-row version, not 3-row)? Is it significantly roomier?"
"I ordered an inventory Model 3 back in November. I really want to go to the showroom to look at the Y to see if I like it as well, but am afraid that I'll like it more and just feel regret for not waiting. :P"
wondering if now would be a good time to trade in an old non-tesla car and get that sweet (sort of) discount on a model y.
Is it best to pick the first available date or should you do any day for delivery?
It sounds like it's mostly performance model y's with the performance/rim upgrades that are getting them right?  I got the model y performance non-performance upgrade and haven't received the email yet.  I wonder if that's the reason why.
"My question is- any indication when they will be available at service centers for test driving , or just to sit in and check out? I‚Äôm really curious of the in-person dimensions and feel"
It seems like all of these emails have been for Performance variants only. Anyone out there with a non-Performance get an email? I wonder how long it will take for them to send invites to non-Performance Ys
"This is really exciting! On the 31st of January, I received an email from my local delivery team about my Model Y order. It said that the vehicles were shipping sooner than expected and to be ready to upload my documents. Though it was not -this- official email, I'm even more looking forward to receiving it now! I was initially thinking I'd be lucky for all this to be happening in the Fall at the earliest.  I imagine I'll still be well behind all the performance trims and earlier AWD pre-orders."
"I‚Äôm really happy for you all, but also just hopeful this brings me one step closer to UK pre-orders opening. üôè"
SOOOO excited! Can't wait to see the reviews and especially Sandy Munroe's teardown!
"Anyone get the email for Y, LR AWD FSD yet ?  
Did not get any email yet for me, I am in California."
s t o n k s
"$60,990 as built plus 10% tax."
It's awesome to see everyone's excitement for these cars.
Got the email.  Model Y dual motor long range + FSD. (Did not order performance).
"Received email at 1:30am awd non performance Red picked any day in March delivery from Miami
FL now I‚Äôm Excited"
"I ordered the 7 seater and got an email saying I could call an advisor to switch to 5 seater for a March delivery. Didn‚Äôt say anything about whether I‚Äôd keep my lower price from last year, but I assume that‚Äôs why they said to call instead of doing it in my account."
Thanks :) The worldwide attention has been incredible. I just happened to tweet my announcement two minutes after the email came in to Third Row Tesla who has a blog and the rest is history. I‚Äôm glad more emails are going out today.
Any confirmation in all of this about the availability of a towing package from the factory?
"Someone on Telsa's own forum is saying they have a delivery date for their white on white Model Y. 

C'mon white interiors!!!"
"Seems everyone that has a Y ordered has the ‚Äúprepare for delivery‚Äù page, even if it‚Äôs a 7 seater, which don‚Äôt start production until 2021. I think we‚Äôre back to where we were last night with just performance/non-performance (w/ FSD) and black interiors getting March delivery emails, for now."
Just another example of Tesla's mixed messaged communication.  It will continue.  Existing 3 owner with Y RWD order.
"Anyone missing their Model Y order, because when I sign in it‚Äôs gone only thing I see is Model S and Model X if i want to order.

I ordered Model Y LR AWD white/black interior"
"Enjoy the customer service lolüò©üò≠
It‚Äôs the only issue, and it‚Äôs a nightmare. Car is awesome CS is abominable !"
"For those of you who got emails, did the pricing change to update current pricing on website, or did you have any sort of ""earlier locked in pricing""? or too early to tell, they hit you up with that at delivery?"
"Daily thread checkup...

Still no email for my LR AWD white exterior, black interior, turbine wheels, and no FSD option in Bay Area ordered 3/2019..."
"Only thing I didn‚Äôt get was FSD, upgraded paint or 7 seats/white interior"
"Yea, but I‚Äôm not getting any younger lol"
"Hi Ya‚Äôll, Just popping back in to say I got my car finally. In fact it was so exciting, I made a video about it. Elon even liked it. Talk to you later!"
"Will be fishing around for a good deal on a used Model 3. Anyone out there interested in getting more $ than what Tesla is/will offer you?? 

Hit me up!!"
There goes my shot of getting my second 3 before the end of March.
* have not yet begun
"Jeez I ordered back in August 2019 and nothing :( oh well, hopefully I'm not too far behind and I guess that it's an extra month earning interest on my money I put aside for this."
"Based on most comments here, the only delivery emails being sent out at for the Performance model. 

Nationwide, order date doesn‚Äôt seem to matter much."
"If someone has an order scheduled for delivery in March and wants to sell their order, I‚Äôd pay $1,000."
"I see Tesla‚Äôs ‚Äòcommunication‚Äô hasn‚Äôt changed since the Model 3 rollout. 

_sigh_ here‚Äôs to hoping Cybertruck goes smoother?"
Commence M3 used price drop!
When did you guys order?
"So jealous, been waiting since March 14th at 5pm. Hope your delivery is a great experience and I cannot wait for mine as well!"
Congratulations! Looking forward to seeing rhese on the streets.
Oh and I think some kind of $1400 delivery fee as I recall
"No email here yet,
Model Y reserved July 2019,
dual motor (non-performance)

I wonder if I should switch to Performance to get mine earlier? don't see many dual-motors getting emails.
Edit: yikes, it's an $8,000 jump to get Performance, nevermind...

Edit2: and a Model Y  does _not_ get Track Mode."
Wheeeee. Guess I can put in my order now.
Nice and we are still waiting for our model 3 bought back in december...
Stonks
"Ordered mine Dec 15th. Updated order on Feb 12th (maybe that pushed me back of the line?)

Black/performance/white interior/FSD.

&#x200B;

No email :(( 

  
In Cali too!! wtf?!"
"Anyone in LA with a Model Y interested in road tripping to Columbus, Ohio around March 21"
did you order day 1 too?
Which model did you get? LR or Performance?
Can you charge it off of a regular outlet or do you have to get an electrician to install special equipment?
"There will be no S3X here for a while, but at least we know Y."
[deleted]
Missed opportunity to just call them S3X owners
The correct order is S/3/X.
Y?
Lol just 6?
My guess is once they have fulfilled most of the model Y orders in North America they will release the updated model S and X interior.
And then we're going to have the Plaid owners coming up.
This is the first I‚Äôve heard about Tesla contacting LR RWD reservation holders- let alone providing an estimated delivery date. Crossing my fingers that I hear something soon!
"I‚Äôm hoping this stays true, but my chat with Tesla support yesterday gave me ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt be producing the LR RWD‚Äù"
"> and was told over the phone I was looking at june delivery for RWD. (East coast)

It says on Tesla's FAQs that they are NOT making the RWD at this time, only the DUAL MOTOR.  You better check that order."
Please post a ton of awesome photos and videos once its delivered!
So excited you left out a word in your sentence. Performance variant?
When did you order?
Any idea why the performance upgrade lowers the max range from 315 miles to 280?

Is your username derived from the Tool song off the √Ünima album?
I browse too much Reddit. I read your post as ‚Äú2 out of 10‚Äù and was so confused.
Whaatttttt!!! I ordered before you and haven't gotten mine yet :(
What was your seat color?
Same!
Same here
post on imgur and share the link although your words are good already
"March 15, 2019 was when the Y was unveiled. Coincidence, I think not."
Accounting for cross country shipping that means the cars will be leaving the factory very soon!
quick question! When did you place your pre-order? I did mine fairly late so I wanted to see if these deliveries were starting first come -first serve or not.
What was your seat color?
yes
One day they‚Äôll be reasonable. One day....
"Not likely, in my opinion. What makes you think Model Y availability will make used Model 3 values dip?"
I hope I get yours lol
how long can you defer delivery?
"This summer will be insane for deliveries, with the ID.3 starting to be delivered in Europe."
"That is where we are stuck as well. June delivery. I wonder how Tesla is going to handle people who ordered originally expecting delivery around summer/fall. 

Do we just black out all the dates in March!?"
How far in advance was it possible to choose? I ordered an LR AWD non performance. Was hoping to get it in October - December timeframe. I pre-ordered in early January before the Q4 earnings call with the $2500 payment.
Same. Did you say you weren't available or not respond at all?
Are you a current tesla owner?
October 27 2019?
PYD looks so funny
"Really hope so. Waiting to do a test drive before committing here, as we'd be replacing a larger MDX with it. Can't wait for first real reviews."
I went with my parents to test drive all 3 models last week and the guy who helped us said they wouldn‚Äôt have a Y available for test drive until about 6 months after release.
This is what I am waiting for as well. On paper I think it is a better vehicle than the 3 but I still want to check it out in person before really considering it.
I hope the Philly showroom gets it soon.
"same, sorting by New this time"
">4. You would have the option to delay production of the vehicle if you don't want it immediately

That's good to know! I wasn't expecting it to come out so soon and can't take delivery yet"
"I'm definitely going to have to delay if I get the email so glad to hear you can do that. I'm hoping that won't force me to the current price. I ordered right before the Q4 call so it would be $990 more if that happened.

**Edit:** To answer my own question, Tesla chat support just told me the following:

"" Congrats! When we reach out to coordinate delivery or if you've already received an email or SMS, you can respond back directly and advise that you'd like to push out delivery. Delaying delivery should not change pricing. "" 

I also asked how long it would be possible to delay delivery, but they did not have a concrete answer for that at this time."
"I've driven in a model 3 and absolutely loved it. But to have that power, software AND a higher ride height and dog space in the back?

It's the dream car. Enjoy it!"
Me too! Someone on the other forum ordered their performance model Feb 15 2020 and got the delivery email too! I‚Äôm hoping us LR can get ours by early summer!
"Would be interested. On the list for an LR AWD, but assuming we see some good opportunities on a used M3, may punt my order to go the more financially responsible route...

What do we expect will happen with the used M3 market all??"
"For typical of what a car sells for used after a year or two? Yes. For the hyper inflated, ""might as well but a new one"" model 3 aftermarket prices? nahh"
How much are you looking to get?
"Ours is coming soon as well. We had a huge fiasco where someone wasn't responding to Tesla's messages that their model 3 performance was ready for pick up, so they let us know (it was identical to the one we ordered). We were so freaking excited that we were going to get it like 2 weeks early. We got there did all the paper work, got in the car and the touch screen didn't work. They told us they would fast track the repair, but it being a new car, we didn't want one that had a problem before even leaving the lot."
"I ordered my M3 LR AWD during the last week of January. I just got my purchase agreement and VIN on Monday. My advisor said it'd be this week, a couple of weeks ago, but it looks like it'll be longer."
I ordered Jan 6 and got mine on Jan 29. Must have lucked out.
Ordered mine in October with an expected arrival before the end of last year.  I just got an email today saying I might get mine in 4-6 weeks.
Took me a week from order to delivery and picked it up first week of February. I used ev-cpo and found a brand new one that came into inventory. It was within the 250 mile range so I wouldn't be charged extra for transportation. They disappear fast though.
">waiting 6 weeks

902 days, checking in."
Aren't they readily available at your local BMW dealerÔºü
[deleted]
This seems to be first Model Y AWD for delivery. Congrats.
Just saw someone who ordered on announcement day get an invite for the AWD as well on Facebook.
"Holy shit. I'm In Louisiana also. Have not received the email. Ordered Feb 14 2020, LR AWD White on white. Non fsd. So the white interior and non fsd are holding mine back atm. Wasn't expecting this so quickly"
"Right on, I just swapped my white interior for black interior with the hopes that it‚Äôll get my order in quicker.

Order details:
-	Preordered in Dec 2019
-	Model Y LR AWD
-	Black paint job
-	No FSD (here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm worried they may not process my order for March delivery üôÅ)
-	5 seater
-	19‚Äù wheels


Congrats on getting your spot!"
I got my LR AWD with FSD this morning too in Kansas City. Ordered a few weeks ago.
Wow that's nuts. I've had my AWD non performance (same everything as you except Gemini wheels) on order since April of last year and nothing... In WA as well. Congrats to you! I'm so jealous!
That‚Äôs good karma for your name ! Well deserved
Color variants?
White interior?
Performance as well?
It absolutely will.
"Just wait...the influx is coming. The fact Carmax and Tesla continue to lowball, once supply tics up, game on."
"I got super excited too when I saw this pop up on my Tesla order page. I shared with a friend who already has an M3 on order (not built or delivered) and he went through same thing. It seems the email notification is the actual indicator of it being built, not the Prepare for Delivery pageüò≠"
"As far as I know, everyone does, even 7 seater orders. It doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll get your car in March, you still have to wait for the email"
That‚Äôs the boat I am in.
All black interior?
"If you've got S and X, why do you want Model Y? Does your family need a 3rd car or are you a collector?"
"Did you happen to order FSD as well? 

I‚Äôm trying to figure out why I have not received an email (PY, all black, upgrades wheels, etc, current Model S owner). Only difference is I didn‚Äôt order FSD."
what interior?
Are you trading in a car?
What seat color?
\*cries in South American\*
">LR AWD Blue Ext, White Int, with FSD

Same exact configuration here and my portal also says Prepare for delivery, no email yet.

 LR AWD Blue Ext, White Int, with FSD"
Pretty sure White interior is what's holding your email back. I don't think anyone w/ white interiors have their numbers called up yet.
"This is a car salesman problem, not unique to tesla.

Tesla sales is a much better experience than others, but ultimately, they can't answer this questions unless they are fanatics. Just like when you go to Best Buy they know zip about the computer or washing machine you want to buy.

Sure there are computer geeks working at BB who know which SSD model is being used in each machine, and the r/w speed of them, but in general, they don't. Tesla is the same.  


This forum is a much better source"
"Yikes! I sent an email with some questions myself -- I hope the responses are better than that! 

Just out of curiosity, when did you put in your order? My specs are the same as yours, but you're the first person I've seen today who had a grey model shipping."
Some people ordered last week. I think if you order a performance variant it doesn't matter.
"As far as I know, the order is tied to the person on the order, and can't be changed. The only way to transfer would be for the original person to pay for and take delivery of the car, pay sales tax, get the title, and then sell the car and transfer title to you, whereby you would also have to pay sales tax."
"I have the white interior ordered, watched many many videos on it before pulling the trigger..."
I liked the black with wood. But white interior is like Tesla standard so not sure if I should change it.
"I did white interior, red exterior. I love the look of the white/red Roadster 2.   


Red and black has always been my favorite color combo, and the white interior reminds me of the Dragon Crew/Falcon 9."
Similar situation
FSD?
Which wheels? So far only heard about reservations for AWD with 20 inch induction wheels getting emails.
"Last night I had the option to enter information in. Now it just has this where before I could enter information: ""
Next Steps

As your delivery date approaches, we‚Äôll contact you to confirm your registration, payment method and, if applicable, trade-in details""

Still no email."
LR RWD+FSD base everything else and have the same page.  No email.
"My non performance AWD with 19"" wheels just changed to the same. No email yet."
"Likewise; LR AWD+FSD Blue; Black Interior. 19"" wheels
No email just changed on the tesla page."
Weird. I am in Wisconsin and ordered on October 27 and got the email.
Where are you located?
This is perplexing. Late order East coasters are getting emails too.
what color did you preorder? most people seem to get blue atm.
Premium black and white interior? Haven't seen anyone get a delivery email for that option yet.
I ordered a performance on reveal day and also did not receive an email.  :(  Wondering if I'm being left behind since I have seen comments stating someone who ordered much more recently and lives East of me has already got it.
And did you get an invite...?
[deleted]
"AWD LR promised for Massachusetts this fine morning

MSM w black interior"
"Pretty sure they aren't making RWD anymore, so all reservations are AWD..."
Same!!!
I‚Äôm in Denver and ordered Performance with white on white. I ordered Feb 8th 2020 and still haven‚Äôt received an email.
I'd be happy if we can get our 7-seater by Xmas
"Only performance with the option package, 5 seats and black interior"
Seems there have been a few.
"There was a comment made just before Christmas in a Model Y thread by someone who claimed to be a Tesla employee, that they will start MY right hand drive production ""late summer "" so September this year hopefully"
Yes there was one above

Finally?! This is a pretty fucking quick turnaround from unveiling to in customer‚Äôs hands. Tickle Me Elmo probably had a longer turnaround.
"My speculation is that with so many similar parts to the 3, it won‚Äôt be near as bad. Seats for example. Aren‚Äôt they identical? We won‚Äôt have an initial wave of bad seats. I‚Äôm sure there are many similar examples"
Don‚Äôt trade it in when used market for 3‚Äôs is going to be great...make me a deal on your M3 and I‚Äôll best Tesla‚Äôs offer!
"A lot of the same tech. Same materials, same attachment schemes, etc. should be fine.

Saratoga in Cali?
[deleted]
Upgrade pack or stealth?
"Yes, performance gets priority.  We'll need to sit tight while performance trims are delivering to get an update on ours.  There are a lot more AWD preorders so it'll take some time.  Hopefully not more than a month or two : )"
Location?
Did you also get red?
"If you want the performance I would make that change today. Even though you reserved it earlier anyone who has reserved a performance got an email today and will be getting their car before you. You are currently most likely at the top of the list for your category of model Y. It wasn‚Äôt the right move to wait for your order to be selected to change to performance. But if you wait now you can get the Long Range AWD, that‚Äôs what I am doing."
I reserved an AWD back in October and then changed to the Performance right around the Q4 announcement. I received my email as well.
Sweet! First Seattle delivery I've seen. Congrats. :)
Can you share the costs?
Location? Fsd?
performance or regular lr awd?
Which wheels?
FSD?
"This is correct. I have seen 0 white interiors, from performance and non-performance."
I have PYD with black interior and nothing... very sad.
Can I ask which wheels you got?
Any idea why the price went up? Those colors are the same price.
March 15th is the official date. You are likely seeing test or employee Model Ys.
Looks like if you switch it to the MYP you might get it sooner. Lol
No questions but congrats!
Seems like the performance models (no third row) are being prioritized
"I think the third row is supposed to hit production next year, so yes. AWD will probably start being produced earlier."
"As far as delivery time: Performance > AWD > LR RWD (I'm sure they'll make some) > SR. 

White Seats, Red Paint, and 3rd Row are likely to give a later delivery as well. 

Also International deliveries will probably be later. Not sure on that though. Like they're already delivering internationally in high volumes from Fremont with the Model 3, so they might not do what they did with the Model 3 - which was basically deliver it only in the US for a year first, then move internationally."
"I‚Äôve seen a red confirmation. But no grey or black. Not sure if they haven‚Äôt pushed those out yet, or if they aren‚Äôt popular so we haven‚Äôt heard anything about them yet."
We are white with black and got the email. Midwest region.
"White on white performance, midwest, day 0 reservation, no email."
">ow, the order is tied to the person on the order, and can't be changed. The only way to transfer would be for the original person to pay for and take delivery of the car, pay sales tax, get the title, and then sell the car and transfer title to you, whereby you would also have to pay sales tax.

I just looked into changing my color from grey to blue and I would have been brought up to the new price :("
Is it even possible to order in the UK yet?
"Little bigger than the 3 and therefore a lot smaller than the X.

"First. Things may shift. Early in the day is best, to avoid backups during the day."
Performance+black interior if i read this thread correctly
We'll be lucky to see RHD this year
Only being sent out to performance 5 seaters with black seats.
A few have.
Fsd?
Did your order include FSD?
"I‚Äôve been wondering this, too. Haven‚Äôt seen anything."
"Check your CC to see if you were charged the deposit. I sweeeeear I reserved a cybertuck on reveal night but it‚Äôs not there and I wasn‚Äôt  charged so I guess I screwed something up
Edit: I found it. I paid for my CT reservation with PayPal which used a different e-mail from my main tesla account."
If I didn't have $3k negative Equity I'd take you up on it
"I wonder how long this time before RHD appears, 18 months like the Model 3 or sooner?"
They seem to be starting with Performance models in March.
White seats or black exterior?
What specs are you looking for?
"Don't forget the $2,500.00 they had to put down for the order. ;)"
"Oh no, then we'll have to listen to you whine all over again. Can I tempt you in a slightly used Hyundai instead?"
Probably because you called it ‚ÄúCali‚Äù
I haven‚Äôt seen anyone get an email who ordered a white interior. That may be why.
What do you mean ‚Äútoo‚Äù? The guys in the tweet claims he placed his order two weeks ago...
Performance with the upgrade
Regular outlet will charge around 3-6 miles of range per hour and NEMA 15-50 will charge around 30-60 an hour
I'm gonna really miss the folks giving us their detailed test drive review notes 3 yrs post release
Pipe down over there!
Jesus all these Ys blocking up the SC! /s

As is tradition
"I've felt a little guilty, not gonna lie.  :-)"
"Yeah, but have you seen how the glass looks when it gets rained on?"
So Tesla is just a bunch of S3X workers?
S3X owners or S3X havers?
I personally like Cyber S3X
"Indeed, I follow this obsessively and this is a big deal for RWD owners if true. We dont even have confirmation it will be made yet"
"Here is the related reddit post on Tesla contacting a few of us. 

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ezkwx3/possible\_changes\_to\_delivery\_process\_model\_3\_vs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ezkwx3/possible_changes_to_delivery_process_model_3_vs/)"
"Until there's anything official, never believe chat."
Is that actually what they said or just the impression you got?
"And how old or up to date is that FAQ? 

I'm not even interested in taking delivery until FSD is released anyway. Just relaying information given to me. I'm really happy with my S75D and free charging for life :)"
Day 1
"Bigger wheels, stickier tires, bigger brake discs.

All of these increase the energy needed to spin the wheels, but improve performance (arguably the bigger wheels are actually bad for performance, but people seem to associate rubber band tires with high end and performance cars).

So it's a trade off if you prefer performance or range."
Being honest about it. They should have done the same with the 3.
The shame of it is they don‚Äôt offer the 20‚Äù wheels on the performance trim that don‚Äôt affect range
The bigger wheels
"Less efficient car in general, with bigger tires, bigger brakes, less efficient motors, and higher base power consumption."
[deleted]
The real question!
90% of world besides US uses date/month/year. He means 2nd October! (I think)
[deleted]
Beware the Ides of March.
"Right?! 30-40k for performance and I'm in!

(likely not for a really long time :/)"
I personally think they are already reasonable for the feature set.
"People trading up, is the theory. 

But personally, I suspect demand is sufficiently strong for used 3s that prices won‚Äôt meaningfully drop for some time. (Hoping at least until the CyT launch....)"
I heard of people delaying the model 3 all the way up till now I want to wait for battery day to see if they made any improvement or are going too before I commit to the model Y fully I just resereved the model Y 2 weeks ago
Yeah they‚Äôll probably deliver 500 ID3 before a week of battery supply enforced stop work.
For my 3 I timed it so I‚Äôd get it right before the lease on my current car ended. Turns out it ended up coming a month early so I had to scramble. It also meant I was able to get it before the end of the year so I got the full tax credit. I saved more by getting that than I lost by paying double payments for three months.
Yes
"I am not a Tesla owner.  Ordered like Jan 15 or so, got the email.  Red, performance, fsd."
Yes.
You're losing nearly 30cubic foot of space....
What about just to see & sit in? That'd be enough for me..
"Good to know you can delay via text directly. Very curious about the last part they did not have an answer for.

I could change configuration to 7 seater for a bit to delay it a couple months if needed."
This
"Wish I could plunk down for a performance. But want the range and don't want to spend the cash on a performance without the performance package.

Hopefully it's not too long a lead time."
"To be honest I think it'll stay stable this year but plummet 2nd half of next year. Just based on delivery Outlook and global distribution. 

If your going to buy used I would try to do it in the next 3 months so you can get the most out of it or wait till May 2021 forward.

If your actually interested let me know. Happy to discuss it."
Lol what do you think the realistic price is
$420.69
"Not really sure. Ideally 50 but I'd have to check the market.

It's a M3 AWD LR FSD. Some minor additions: 

hw 3.0 installed last week, 

brand new tires (also 1 week old), 

protective covers in various spots (kick guards, center console, screen, step plates, armrest, seat controls, door handles, window controls) all the high touch areas

USB hidden console with USB c and hidden teslacam storage

600$ proper all weather mats including trunks (don't need them in Florida but lived in NJ for a few months)

Edit: also Tesla puddle lights and wireless charging mat


There's some other stuff I can't remember but nothing that alters the car look, I like a super clean look."
"Ouch, that sucks. Haven't heard that one before."
What's the reason?
If you custom order it takes longer because they have to ship it from Germany.

FSD and white paint.

"Yes, the Mode S will go."

"Not true, Tesla can change the order to another account. I did it with a Model 3."
Same
What made you decide white??
"Do it. White interior is amazing. Every time I get into a Tesla without my white interior, it is just drab. White makes the car look more spacious and futuristic. 

There is a bit of upkeep involved as you see all of the dust/debris that gets into the creases, but totally worth it for me. Also, the seats need a bit if a wipe-down every couple of months as you‚Äôll see very light staining over time, but they clean pretty easily."
"I‚Äôm honestly okay with that though..not in a position just yet for another Tesla, but threw down on a reservation anyways.  ü§´ü§™."
oh yeah :) That's one of my main reasons for buying a Tesla.
"I actually ordered the 19"" ""Sport"" wheels back in October, which got automatically upgraded to the 20"" Induction wheels later."
color?
Wa state. Black on black model y performance. I am on the lookout for my email though!
Yeah someone is saying it is a color issue maybe. What color did you order?
What invite?
Woah that‚Äôs very exciting. Mind me asking your order date / location / exterior paint / interior color?
Sorry I meant to say non-performance AWD
I think they‚Äôre asking if any have been a step down from Performance.
"I thought they just had no time frame for LR RWD, did they officially say something else?"
Hopefully soon!
Yeah but the first gen Tickle Me Elmo's has pretty bad battery thermal management. People who lived in hot climates were only getting maybe 30 or 40 tickles per charge. That's not enough to make it through the day without charging at lunch.
It's six months earlier than the projected date at unveiling.  Elon time has reversed itself.
Yep
"Thanks! Ya, I figured I was in a unique situation, forgot to try incognito. Got my confirmation in the end. I was expecting better from Tesla where they would actually QA their delivery confirmation page."
"Acceleration boost = upgrade

"I reserved a performance model and didn't get an email. I think you don't understand how the process has unfolded today. Check out the thread. When i ordered I couldn't choose the performance package, which is different than the model. I ordered a performance model. They just recently made the change to the performance package as an option that is no cost. I was day 1 on ordering a model y performance"
"Damn. What color combo did you choose? White, Red or Blue exterior?"
$69900 with tax and delivery.
"Texas, yes"
Regular LR AWD
Seems all the non performance are FSD
"day 1 $2500 down payment...long range awd performance, black exterior with black interior...still no email ;\\"
I originally got the 19inch then it is upgraded to the 20inch
"It went up atleast $990 because of the previous price increase. If he placed the order back in March last year, then the black was the free color, but white then was changed. Since he didn‚Äôt change it since then, he is now being charged the $1000 for grey. If he switches back to black, the cost will stay the same."
thanks!
When are they taking deliveries for the AWD?
I‚Äôve seen an MSM confirmation over at /r/TeslaModelY.
"White with black interior P's seem to be getting delivered now. I'm also white+white, I think they're just making the white interior second."
No not yet
Ok thanks
Seems a few LR AWD have gotten the email.
got my email today !
With FSD as well
"Yep, I got AWD non-performance with FSD, 7-seater. From looking at recent comments, it seems they‚Äôre also starting the regular non-P AWD ones if we got FSD."
What are they offering you to buy back if you don‚Äôt mind sharing?
"I know,  I'm just getting excited. I couldn't justify the performance upgrade to the wife. It's already going to be the fastest car I've ever owned."
"White seats, blue exterior, LR awd."
"Hi, any spec would be fine."
"$1,000 on top of anything they put down."
That Hyundai will find a wonderful home in Mexico City
?
Let the hate flow through you.
Ahh yes. Exactly
This. Everyone has said they have black seats. Performance and black seats are priority right now it seems.
really!?! wow
Nice!!! I expect pictures!!
"Under what circumstance would it charge 60 an hour?
I thought it was limited to 48 amps like the 3, which comes out to 45 an hour?"
"I'm going to miss the CSI Photoshop size measurements of the Model Y prototypes though. Once it's out, we're not going to need someone being like ""well in this photo of the 63277, you can see from the reflection in the grille from the nearby Honda Civic that the Tesla is 8.7 inches taller. When we account for the perspective of a known wheelbase, that means we'll get 39.2 inches of left elbow room!"""
We might never know how everyone feels after their first 2000 miles of ownership ....
Now you will get them for y
Lemme guess. Original Roadster owner?
"You jest, but I know 5 people off the top of my head that we‚Äôre waiting on the Y to buy a Tesla.  Already there are lines for the SCs around here.

"Until there‚Äôs anything official I‚Äôm really not believing anything, but a guy needed something to cling onto."
"Its on the Tesla website, on the Model Y FAQ.  Also, if you go into your order for the Y, RWD LR is no longer an option, only Dual Motor and Performance."
"It said, quoting (I took a screenshot):

‚ÄúYou will be getting an email and/or text message with information on what to expect with these orders since we aren‚Äôt going to produce the RWD LR Model Y.‚Äù"
"It seems current, especially because if you go to order or edit your order, RWD is no longer even an option."
Nice. Congrats. Ordered mine last week. Ha!
What date was that roughly?
Less give and more harsh ride in the sidewall with larger wheels.
"Rubber band tires offer better turn in due to the smaller sidewalls being unable to deform with lateral force. I personally like a bit of sidewall for the ride quality, but if you want a high performing car you have to balance what you get. Bigger rims (within reason) also have the added benefit of allowing you to install larger brakes without clearance issues. You don't want huge wheels though because that just adds to unsprung weight.

The only aspect of the performance trim that increases range is the larger battery, everything else reduced efficiency and comfort in exchange for speed and handling."
"Do we have any reports on the Performance Y accepting smaller tires off the bat? I'd like to think all the Y tires will be interchangeable, even with the Performance calipers."
"They likely would affect range, but the ride would be better than with the 21s."

"Lol I'm still used to using dd/mm format from the military, trying to get back into what everyone else uses again :)"
"And deliveries are to the US first, so..."
These are getting released to America first. So we are using the USA date system.
"God I love that album, and that song.

Agreed: we're going to see more 3s on the used market as people trade up but demand is so huge prices aren't going to come down for a while.
The Y was supposed to be less range at announcement. I think you're already seeing those improvements.
I don't think any battery day announcements/tech will be reaching the current model 3 or y. Just like how the battery tech in the model 3 is not being used for the x/s.
"Note that people deferred their Model 3 *reservations* for a long time. They put down $1000 refundable deposit to basically ""hold their place in line until orders could be made"". 

But that's a whole different thing that what you did with the Model Y. You *ordered* one, and once you've ordered a Tesla, you are on Tesla's schedule as far as accepting your car. If you don't take delivery within a week or so of it being ready, they'll scrap your MVPA and sell your VIN to another customer.

So I wouldn't count on being able to blithely defer until you feel like it. You might get booted to the back of the line. Whether that actually means anything, though, is anyone's guess at this point."
Good to know deferring delivery is okay. I'm in Florida now and want to take delivery of the Y when I'm in Michigan in August :)
"Really? You think for their biggest product launch in decades all they have is 25 MWh, when they did just fine with the e-golf?"
"!!! I ordered before this! What part fo the world are you in? I ordered performance, black, and still nothing."
What seat color did you have?
Are you on the west coast? Do you own a Tesla?
"Looks like a few things might be true...

1.	Performance Model Y‚Äôs mainly shipping first (based on other comments)
2.	There weren‚Äôt that many preorders up until the Q4 conference call (hence the change to a $100 reservation fee vs $2500 down payment), so someone who ordered in October can get their car next month"
"That's right. I don't use the space, save for a handful of times (moving). If the Y can hold my 2 kids and black lab, we're good to go."
"Hmm, not sure on that one. You could always call your local showroom and ask."
I‚Äôm with you. I road trip a lot so there was basically no reason for me to buy a performance. I‚Äôm gonna sit very impatiently waiting for my email. Lol. I just read on Twitter than even East Coasters are getting their emails! Gives me hope that I‚Äôll have mine before my 4th of July trip!
"Current prices *are* realistic, considering, y‚Äôknow, they do actually sell at those prices. So many here just don‚Äôt want to accept that reality!"
"On average, vehicles tend to lose 20% value after the first year, and 15% every year after that. I would absolutely love to pay $27k for a two year old model 3, but there are hardly any for sale less than $35k! Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places, but that's just what I've seen"
Yes this is the correct price
pm'd
Day 1 reservation holder?
When did you order?
Yea babayyy
Yes that‚Äôs new but it applies to everyone including orders that won‚Äôt be fulfilled until 2021 (7 seater) and the LR RWD
I haven't seen a single one confirmed yet with the black and white interior. :(
"figures, we picked white, I'm sure it will cause a delay"
"Thanks for letting me know! Hopefully once the Model Y starts showing up in each showroom, things will get better."
"Well, then I stand corrected. Was this a family member or someone totally unrelated?"
"I decided white because of how it seems to change the experience of being in the car by making it appear more spacious, open, happy and zen like. Plus, I saw how relatively easy it was to clean it if I wipe it down once a month. Lastly, I'll be moving to a place that has more gray days than sunny days (I'm from Florida) and can snow close to half the year so I thought a brighter environment would brighten up the mood as well. Lol"
"Blue, black interior."
Did you get the perf upgrade?
White on white.  Someone else had said maybe only black interiors are going?
"Sorry, email. Did you get the email."
White with black interior.
"It‚Äôs a $74,000 car with all the upgrades and 7 seats.  Ouch"
Fsd?
"I didn‚Äôt get the email either. but when I log in to my account it asks for payment, trade in and other details to take delivery! (Jan 2020 AWD non-FSD order)"
"Haven't said yet. But its clearly not going to be after SR, and it's obviously after Performance..."
"Sorry. MSM, not grey. Grey doesn‚Äôt do it justice."
"$32300 is what I got through the automated trade in system, when I actually get a VIN and get a Final offer I'm hoping that will go up
right this minute, I owe about $42k on the car($14k miles Black/Black SR+), so to sell private party, I'd have to overcharge past retail

I do have free unlimited supercharging on the VIN, and I believe they only strip those features away when they are selling a car"
"Yeah, IMO the loss of range and the increase in price is hard to justify, but I am getting majorly jealous right now."
Only performance versions will be delivered this quarter
the 2500 is applied to the price of the car
I ordered 2 weeks ago as well.
Shouldn't be too surprising. They are trying to bulk up quarterly numbers for March.
Unfortunately I'm not an electrician I was just throwing out some average numbers lol
"Dude, you forgot to factor in atmospheric refraction due to the extreme digital potato zoom used to take the photo. Definitely 39.3 inches for the left elbow."
"> left elbow room!""

happy cake day!"
ENHANCE!!
This year tesla will build it's one millionth car. It's two millionth car will come in 2021. Superchargers and service centers need to expand FAST!
"Yep, I got my 3 in March of 2018. Amazing progress for a new model to be out so soon. 

Yeah but the real issue is those old S and X that charge so slow... I kid, I kid, respect the OGs. LA during Xmas is a hot mess."
"They did a big push to complete the trans-Canada highway and other places that had nothing for far too long. Next up is I-94 between MSP and Billings, MT. With those complete I'm hoping there will be more focus on the network in general."
Tesla absolutely understands the need to continue to expand supercharger network. And service centers. And mobile service technicians. And phone support. And everything else that goes on as part of a business.
*nice*
"And how are you accounting for the power wheel model S?  Hmm??

/s"
"Mmm ok, thanks for the reply!"
But explain why 2 different people from the same service center have contacted me 3 times to submit insurance/paperwork on the order. Like I said I'm just passing on info that I have received from employees.
Location?
Model Y reveal was 16 Mars 2019 so give or take 1 day around that date
It is still day 1.
"Look at an Indy car, F1 car, or a NASCAR.  Sidewalls are good for performance.  Big wheels allow for bigger brakes without changing fenders, that's the only performance advantage.  Big wheels are heavier, harsher, and not as grippy.  Though they do look nifty."
I‚Äôm sure you could buy them afterwards by themselves on Tesla‚Äôs parts website. The reason I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be able to configure with them when purchasing the Y is because similarly for model 3 you can‚Äôt buy the 19‚Äù wheels on the performance model.
"Do you live semi near California? I order a performance Y in January, so I assume you don‚Äôt live on the east coast like me."
"oh, never mind then. v quick delivery!"
haha. I just got that ü§£
Which is dd/mm... Only americans write the date backwards
I usually just do DD-MMM-YYYY as a compromise solution.  Lets me keep things in the order that makes sense but also helps avoid confusion.
"They're like old gun collectors trying to sell a mediocre 1911 for $2,500 all while muttering under their breath ""I know what I got."""
Also why are people holding onto reservations anyway? Just order when you want the car. It's been out for over two years.
"Note that he was talking about deferring a reservation, not an order. All $100 MY payments were orders. They don't do reservations any more."
"I think that global battery supply is extremely stretched right now, given the pauses in production for the EQC, E Tron and the iPace. I think VW won‚Äôt have sufficient batteries to meet demand."
California
Black
"I am in Wisconsin. Do not own a Tesla, currently driving a Volt."
Looks like east and west coast customers are getting delivery emails
What evidence for 2?
I heard yesterday from a Tesla employee the confirmed Performance Y is first.
"All cars lose value. The more expensive the car when new, the bigger the dollar amount lost. It isn‚Äôt uncommon for someone who paid $70k for a car to find they are down $20k after just the first year, EV or otherwise.

In just under 3 years, my Model X depreciated $41k. Many 2016 Model X performance models were down $100k after 4 years."
Ish the problem is the earlier buyers are in for 40% loss. My AWD was 64
"Well that's not at all what OP meant by 6 weeks. That's when he placed his order. If you haven't ordered, then you aren't waiting for delivery."
"March 15, 2019. 8:45pm"
There will be a section when you order about who to put on the title.
Unrelated :)
Love the explanation. I want to get white in white or red exterior and white interior. Haven‚Äôt decided. Definitely want a model y this year though. I‚Äôm obsessed lol
This combo is üî•üî•üî•
"it seems to me like they are producing blue my's at the moment only, thats why op didn't get an e-mail."
"I am very confused by this. This option did not come out until recently. When I put in my pre-order I could not select this. I was not aware I could make any change to this now. I thought once they said I get my car, I go into the options and finalize what I want on the car, including the performance upgrade. Did anyone else that order on announcement day change their settings to get the performance upgrade??"
"I posted a different post about this. I didn't have an option to do that. When I pre-ordered that wasn't a thing. I called tesla today and they said don't make any changes to your order to include that package, you can do it once they match you with a vin. So I am just waiting for an email now.

I thought that the performance package selection might be the issue, but I saw another person who got the email and he didn't make that selection and was an original pre-order person.

I also have not seen anyone yet say they got an email for a black performance, so maybe that is the issue, it is the colors they have available.

Who knows"
I was black on black and didn't get an email so I don't think that is it.
Yes and confirmed ‚Äúany day‚Äù for delivery.
"Yeah it seems that white, blue and red are first up to get delivered so far. Maybe that is just my anecdotal evidence over riding what is actually happening."
"Gotcha. Yeah trade in makes sense if you‚Äôre willing to eat the loss and have to rollover the loan. 

For everyone else, looking to zero in on an used SR+ ideally white or grey exterior delivered may 2019 or later. Hit me up!"
I kind of figured I'd probably have to wait till April or May.
Yep! Good point.
and you got the delivery email also!?!?
lol
"Right but neither am I. Not sure why you‚Äôd just post false information and then hide under the fact you‚Äôre not an electrician 

I‚Äôm not a doctor, but you should eat chocolate with every meal..see how that sounds?

The fastest any home charger can go is 48 amps, off a 60 amp breaker, which produces a speed of 45/mph charging"
"FUCK! I have rather, umm, gentlemanly elbows. Cancelling my Model Y and preordering the Rivian. It's got 39.4 inches for the left elbow, practically a palace."
They are! Filter this map to show only permits and construction. The Supercharger network is expanding RAPIDLY in 2020: https://supercharge.info/map
"I don't know, but if you go to Tesla's website on the Y faq it says they are not producing RWD Y at this time. If you go to order one, RWD is not even an option.  Can't tell you anything else.  Perhaps your sales rep converted your order to the Dual Motor option?"
Los Angeles.
16 Mars? I must have missed it. :(
Happy cake day!
Found the Amazon employee.
"stealth performance is a big thing around here.  smaller rims, cheaper brakes, and no spoiler"
[deleted]
Yeah they must have produced quite a lot already
"Americans write the date in the same manner as people refer to dates in conversation. It may not be the most clean format from an order perspective, but it follows some logic. If anything, the best format would be year/month/day, but the year is generally assumed to be the current one when talking about dates. You would say the concert is on March 10th without needing to tell me it's this year."
"True that, as an European I see no sense in that"
"For me, I held my model 3 reservation for 2+ years because during that time, I had another kid, we wanted a SUV instead. So I actually cancelled my order and got my $1000 back. Then a year after that, I decided to go for a test drive and fell in love and bought it within a month. 

I've even heard some people ordering 3 cybertrucks. One of each variant. Elon touts the reservation numbers but it is for sure inflated due to those folks."
"VW have done a lot in order to ensure they have the battery capacity. Sure they zwickau won't run at 110%, but we'll get somewhat constant, serious numbers."
"i was seriously shopping a heavily discounted volt, when i got a delivery dates for the model 3 LR. i took a leap and never looked back. 

omg, sounds like a pretty dramatic upgrade your making there... good luck and enjoy the ride."
First winter with the Volt using twice as much gas as you expected due to the cold?
"The fact that Tesla felt the need to reduce the cost of preordering a Model Y and the fact that someone who ordered in October in this comment section is getting their car in March makes me think there weren‚Äôt that many preorders in 2019 so many of them can be shipped out in the next couple of months. This is some educated speculation, but there seem to be signs pointing towards it. I think the true test is to see if people who ordered in maybe Dec. or early Jan. get the car by maybe May or June."
"> All cars lose value.

Not all of course. Those few that become collectable increase in value over time.

Edit: Downvote = disagree? Really?"
"> All cars lose value. The more expensive the car when new, the bigger the dollar amount lost.

Both of these statements are patently False. Ask owners of $150k 2005 Ford GTs what their cars are now worth. Or $800k 1994 McLaren F1s. 

‚ÄúI mean only high-volume production cars!‚Äù you say. Okay, but even then not all cars lose value at the same rate, and some even start to appreciate after a while. The Tacoma has been produced for 25 years at this point, but ones that are only a few years old are *still* going to close to that of a new one. Same with Wranglers, WRXes, and yes, Model 3s. 

Your X is depreciating because many would argue the 3/Y are a huge leap ahead of it."
"My 27k came from assuming the current cost without ""savings"" @ about 40k. But you raise a valid point. It just sucks for us who can't afford the full retail price of a model 3 but really want one! lol"
"Then it was 16 weeks...

Ps, what‚Äôs 902 days + April 1st 2016? Ask Siri."
Interesting. I thought they didn't allow that.
Lots of people with confirmation emails in FB groups (some in this post too) saying they ordered White with Black Interior so they must be running multiple colors.
"I‚Äôve seen people with MSM, Red, and black too"
Color combo?
"I got an email and mine is a grey MYP with black 5 seats, 21 Uberturbine wheels and FSD. Also located in California."
"I have a white mid range for 44.5K, almost 12k miles."
Yup. I figured I would get early delivery since I‚Äôm local and performance version will be delivered first.
I didn't post false information. Just giving out a rough estimate of what I have heard and seen
"Yeah, well, my left arm may need more room from the r/teslamotors circlejerk, but both of yours should be huge from pulling your Rivian out of the Tesla supercharger moat!   

I'll see myself out..."
Good!
Well I wouldnt be upset by that if they add an extra motor on my order :)
:( I missed that date as well but rewatched it on YT some days later.
French March.
"Damn, hopefully TX delivery goes smoothly for you."
"Nah it's most likely going by Trim. Performance in the US is first. Then it'll be AWD in the US. 

Actually I wouldn't be surprised if they ship the Performance trims overseas before/while moving on to lower trims this time. Because they already have the Ships going out with Model 3's to europe, so it's not like they can't just share shipments..."
"Well, lots of people say 10th of March in countries that do DD/MM

But obviously YYYY/MM/DD is the superior format, and MM/DD is an acceptable subset of that for dates within the same year.

If you go to your computer, and create a folder for each day of the year and make the name of the folder the date, and sort alphabetically, it should put them in the correct order. MM-DD passed this test, DD-MM fails it. QED. 

TLDR writing the date half backwards is better than writing it completely backwards"
"What? If I refer to a day in this month I just say the number, if I refer to a different month I say number and month.

What you are referring is the ISO for the computer dates, not stuff for humans"
"Sure. If you are telling someone the date orally, you generally start with the month. The concert is in March, or the concert is on March 10th. No one would just say the concert is on the 10th. The year is generally implied to be the current year, so it's less important. I work in a global job, so saying the the concert is on ten March also makes sense. But I get both... just based on manner of speaking."
"Oh just like they did with Audi huh?

"Yeah, erdtt is not very efficient..."
I ordered Model Y Perf on unveiling and have a 2017 Model X. No email. Classic.
"> The fact that Tesla felt the need to reduce the cost of preordering a Model Y 

That change was made to all the other models *before* it was made to Y pre-orders. Several weeks, in fact, if I recall correctly.

The $100 deposit fee change was done to reduce Tesla's costs. Every time someone paid that $2500, Tesla got charged ~$75 by the credit card company. If the person then canceled their order, Tesla's out $75, and they got nothing. By changing from a $2500 refundable fee to a $100 non-refundable fee, they killed two birds with one stone:

1. No more expensive CC transaction fees, for any reason. They spend ~$3 on the fee, but they *always* either make a sale or keep the $100.
2. It's easier for customers to impulse-buy for a mere $100 fee. $2500 is a lot more intimidating."
[deleted]
Got ya.   I think it‚Äôs just the performance models and there wouldn‚Äôt be as many of those.   Why buy a perf SUV...makes less sense.    However I do agree demand will be much lower than the 3 initially because they don‚Äôt advertise and I think most Tesla people will get the Y as a second vehicle when their current 2nd car needs to be replaced.   y will build once people see it on the roads....but I bet they have 50-100k preorders for sure.   Also they dropped the LR RWD so not sure how many that threw into question.
"White exterior and black interior, 5 seater of course.  Also performance upgrade option with 21‚Äù wheels."
"These will be built on one of the two Model 3 lines, if not initially using both to ensure a faster ramp (as well as backlog some Model 3 demand for strong sales of those starting in Q2).  Expect initial production numbers to be lower than Model 3 is currently, as they get their footing on the new lines, but still expect several hundred cars a day.

&#x200B;

This won't be like the initial Model 3 ramp with less than 200 a month, so if you are choosing the higher margin ""P"" version, expect to get it in March, with AWD and lower trims likely coming out in July."
"No one ever has ‚Äúestimated‚Äù that the charging speed is 60mph. It‚Äôs a very precise, exact number that it powers up to, and that number is 45 mph

This is not a matter of relativity. It‚Äôs like saying the capital of Spain is estimated to be Barcelona Valencia or Madrid. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs only Madrid and that‚Äôs the only answer."
The price change was I think $2500.  I went in yesterday and updated my order to Dual from the original LR because I want it asap...Can you show a screen shot of your order?
"Actually, here in overseas we don't expect any deliveries to happen before 2021."
"OK, maybe you do, but that isn't how people speak in the US. I'm not referring to speaking in ISO..."
"Thats because you are speaking english and in english you say the month first when talking. Almost every other european language besides english says the day first and than the month. Same way with adjectives, in english you say the adjectives first and than what they are refering to. In other languages you can do it both ways ."

Even without ERDTT I get about a 20% range hit in cold weather.
With or without FSD?
"It's possible that something about your trim combination caused a delay for you. When I worked in the automotive industry doing new model development, they would build the exact same trim combination all at once for ease of assembly. If Tesla is only building X number of cars per month, they might not have gotten to your exact trim combination yet regardless of when you pre-ordered.  You will probably be one of the first people with your exact trim combination to receive delivery though.



...or Tesla is unable to keep track of pre-order lists.

I'm betting it's the former, but I guess both are possible."
"Your second point is what I‚Äôm saying, it‚Äôs an easier barrier to entry for people to pay $100, hence a way to get more preorders. I don‚Äôt believe the refund cost issue was that much of a factor, that‚Äôs assuming a ton of people would want a refund. 

I think there‚Äôs a good chance there weren‚Äôt that many model Y orders considering that they never have touted the numbers unlike the Cybertruck, which always had the $100 fee. If Tesla could really reduce costs by making the model Y go from the $2500 down payment to a $100 fee, why wait so long to change that?

I feel your point is almost trying to defend Tesla and say ‚Äúoh, there‚Äôs no way they aren‚Äôt getting that few of Model Y orders‚Äù. If demand was so great, they‚Äôd prefer the $2500 down payment to get more cash upfront, but it seems that‚Äôs not the case."
Performance?
Can you please let me know how all 3 compare in the driving characteristics when you receive it?
"i ordered long range AWD day after announcement and received my delivery email this morning!   


edit: i'm in virginia"
">	with AWD and lower trims likely coming out in July.

"Yeah, but in reality, theres not too much of a reason that they can't when you really think about it. 

They will already be doing volume shipments overseas for the model 3's. Like if they decided they wanted to just go by trim regardless if its US or international, I wouldn't really be that surprised. It may actually be a better strategy honestly."
"In french spanish portuguese, Italian, we say ' the concert is in the ten of march' - if i were to translate"
Google already has control you nonce. And Audi literally is VW.
"Also looking to go volt to Y, except I went for LR RWD and am now stuck in purgatory"
"My bad, yes. It‚Äôs been that way since I got it so I‚Äôm used to it now. I got my 2017 brand new in March of 2016."
That shouldn‚Äôt affect production since they technically all have FSD capabilities whether it‚Äôs enabled or not.
"I ordered a Black on Black perf with FSD 03/15/19 @ 2:53AM . I think the thing holding it up may be that I originally ordered the 7 seat version and then changed it to 5 seat. I changed this in August 2019 though, so should be well ahead of everyone. Kind of annoying since I put down $2500 and other recent orders are $100."
"Quoting your original comment:

> The fact that Tesla felt the need to reduce the cost of preordering a Model Y 

What I'm saying is that Tesla didn't change the order fee to convince more people to pre-order Ys. They did it to save costs. It may have had the effect of reducing the barrier to entry of pre-ordering a Y, but that's not *why* they did it."
Do far I prefer the P3D over the S. 3 feels more grounded and sporty. Steering feel is much better on the 3. Tech is faster.
"Right so still just an RN-
So if you hit ‚Äúedit‚Äù order you will see this config is no longer available."
"Europe has CCS Charger, yellow blinkers and other things different so they can't just send American versions, they need to change the line which I am not sure they are willing to do during the production ramp."
"Lots of regulatory hurdles to clear before delivery in each country, so I doubt they will be ready to ship internationally (excluding Canada) before they move to lower trims in the US."
"We occasionally say both in English. The main example would be that we call our independence day the ""4th of July"", but that's the exception rather than the rule"
"No, Google cannot change the content of any website. With Amp they can. And if it were so, and if you're OK with that control, that would make you a moron.

  


And no Audi is not VW. They're owned by the Volkswagen group, but they're not the same brand, have different development and research teams etc. Just because they share parts does not mean they're the same.

It's like saying ""Bugatti literally is Sk√¥da""."
IIRC the initial Model 3 deliveries were made in descending order of price
"I understand, I was curious if they had committed to FSD or not because I'm wondering if pricing is defining the order that Tesla is delivering vehicles."
There is a bigger financial incentive to deliver $100 preorders than yours.
"I disagree, but ultimately there‚Äôs no way to confirm their motivations 100% right now."
"The CCS charger is literally the same as they have on the Model 3, same with the yellow blinkers, which they also already have on the Model 3. And isn't the entire point of the model Y having like 75% the same parts as the Model 3 that they can be manufactured on the same lines together? So literally when they are manufacturing the international Model 3s they can also do the international Model Y's too..."
"Maybe they‚Äôre getting orders out by who paid the most first, but as far as the manufacturing, every car they make is a FSD car."
"We know from Model 3 that they set aside specific weeks when they only make the euro versions, so we know it requires some time to setup.
Another thing is it may take time to get the Model Y accepted with the euro authorities.

I have a Model Y AWD on order but if you were to order one today it will say beginning of 2021."
"But My point is when they alter the line to make International Model 3s, why can't they do the same thing with the Model Y? In fact I'd argue that that is exactly what they will do, the question is when. I'm just not sure if the lines producing the Model 3 will also be producing the Model Y immediately. You know same way the Model S and X are produced on the same line? That's what they intend to do with the 3 and Y. It's literally why it was so important to keep as many parts the same as possible. ... That's how these lines work, like you'll have 2 model Ys for every one 3 rolling down the line.

Sure it may take time to get the Model Y accepted, but how long you think that'll be a couple months? The Model 3 took like a year before it made it internationally. Doubt the Model Y takes that long."
"Yes, you are right they will most likely do the same as for Model 3, but I do not have any proof of that happening this quick."
"total of about 22 vehicles. 

"" Tesla won the contract, which resulted in the military purchasing two Model 3 Standard Range Plus units for exactly NT$3 million. The remaining budget went to the purchase of Wall Chargers and a solar system to charge the vehicles.""

"" Following the two sedans that have been purchased already, the ROCMP has decided to buy up to 20 more electric cars from Tesla. With this, the Model 3 may have just become the Taiwan military's vehicle of choice. """
Taiwan is one of my favorite countries!
"Ok military *police*, aka just model 3s for normal duty, no new electric tank or something."
"Was actually hoping they would order a few dozen cybertrucks,do some structural upgrades and adapt it as some sort of technical/reconaissance vehicles"
Wondering if they will be produced in Giga Shanghai :)
i hope they got the bioweapon-ready air filters
I thought there were cybertruck involved...disappointed
"Wait a minute, what will China think about this?  Isn't the purpose of Taiwan's military singular in its focus to hold off some threats across that sea?"
"Well and good, but what did **China** say?"
* *China will remember that.*
Cybertrucks will be a police force dream
Did Tesla really bid? Or did a subsidiary bid... or did the military just buy 2x Teslas as a trial.
I'm curious why Tesla doesn't try to get on the U.S. federal fleet.
"Cybertruck is expected to have a 200kwh battery right?   And it probably could draw more than 400kw.  The US military has been testing high energy (200+ kw) lasers.  If it's small enough physically, then you could drop it in the bed and use cybertruck as a mobile anti-drone/missile/aircraft platform."
China's new favorite weapon: EMP.
"a ""fleet"" of two vehicles... lolz... i guess it's a start..."
Let us know when they've got power armor like Elon has and wears around the office to intimidate the intern.
Its happening! Encouraging to see electric adoption in police use cases.
"I assume these Model 3s will be coming from the US. Since Taiwan and China are ""enemies."" This also means that the Taiwanese are paying much more because of transportation costs.

If they buy CyberTrucks, of course they'll be coming from the US for the foreseeable future.

All in all, this is a gamechanger incentive for many small and large nations' military to help them become greener military forces. Look to Indonesia to do something similar soon...."
There goes the stock price again...
"That is smart choice because you can save much taxpayers money although Taiwanese government still plains to tax people buying electric vehicles.

However, it would be good to see Taiwanese hi way police would also choice Model 3 as their new ‚Äúred zebra‚Äù to replace those expensive and slow BMWs."
Militarized cyber truck inbound?
"This bid was, in fact, uncontested."
"They could have switched even a decade ago, if you take savings from spare parts, fuel consumption and all the down times produced by ice cars even a roadster is cheaper to operate over longer time frames. plus you are less likely to kill your own staff by carbon monoxide poisoning as it is the case for Ford police cars in the USA for instance, like just standing while the engine keeps burning gas."
"I see a few military uses, but very few for electric vehicles. Range is a very needed design in war, well that and a fast refueling. The war zone doesn't always have electricity.

So for military I recommend just staying gas. A few electric cars wont make too much of a difference in the military and it will just increase military infrastructure needs."
"I don't like that cybertruck and other Tesla vehicles becoming military and law enforcement vehicles. 

The image of those vehicles in conflict zones would make those vehicles iconic in a negative connotation."
It‚Äôs times like these I‚Äôm glad I bought some shares in Tesla. It won‚Äôt get to bitcoin status but I‚Äôm going to ride this one out and see where it takes me.

Ugh.
Cybertruck is basically the warthog from halo anyway.
You guys should calm down it's the military police. It's cool but I wouldn't bet on any military adopting EVs for use in any kind of deployed forces operational capacity. Independence and mobility for vehicles is a big issue and while you can get electricity basically everywhere like gasoline. Trickle charging cybertruck would not work even though it would be great for battery health.

"Ah-ah-ah-ah, vegan velociraptor. Driving his eco-friendly tesla motors police-tank."
Obviously all of us in this sub get off on electric vehicle adoption but weapons of war will be the last to go. Military grade vehicles run on bunker fuel and bacon grease. That type of reliability is a longgggggg way off from being replaced.
"A hybrid would seem like a potential direction.  Electric offering torque, reliability, silent operation (within limits of the battery) making that diesel engine solely a generator (ie, potentially a bit smaller and more efficient, as the battery system offers peak power not the engine).

\[That's before considering autonomy, semi-autonomy and EV/hybrid tech is adding additional options for alternative vehicles/weapons platforms.\]"
"Electric Merkava, with the battery acting as armor"
They use Teslas?
Why is that?
"No, there's absolutely 0% chance of that happening. First of all, Taiwan bans import of cars manufactured in China. (Parts and SKDs are another story, but I digress.) Secondly, the *military* is the buyer. It's literally against the law to use anything Chinese when the Taiwanese military (and government) is involved."
"Yup, if the EMP is strong enough."
Lol not how I meant that. If I recommend it then surly someone else in the military out of the hundreds of thousands around the world have the same thought.
"Diesel Tanker. Easy answer. Diesel doesn't explode when shot it just ignites and burns. It is designed to be that way. Myth busters not only proved this, but so have studies. Especially military vehicles. It is designed so when a spark is ignited all the energy is moved from the occupants. As long as there is gas or diesel in the lines it will still add power and nothing to stop it as well as if there is no fuel it will roll freely. 

While in an electric car if the lines are shot or batteries then it will lose power immediately and also catch fire. As well as if the right portions shot then it will stop power and fail. The motors will introduce a resistance and stop the vehicle. 

So for a war zone 100% would rather be in a diesel tanker. 

Holly wood making cars explode is fake. When a large oil tank is shot the bullet makes a hole. Since fuels burn relatively slow compared to many other chemicals that energy will release at a rate slow enough to leave the entry hole. Typically at least. Also bullet heat doesn't ignite fuels usually, it takes a spark and intense heat with pressure. Like an engine and spark plug."
"For the Humvee, I guess. But the Hummer‚Äîimo‚Äîis less associated with the Humvee than the ‚Äúdouchebag wannabe‚Äù who now can‚Äôt find anyone to sell it to.

We are not doing a tesla TV8
Just a stock cybertruck
TankX
And MBTs are likely to be the last of the bunch due to their much greater weight and technical requirements compared to smaller vehicles.
"They just like having as few different sources of fuel as possible to minimize logistics. Pretty sure Humvees and M1 Abrams tanks all have gas turbines that run on fuckin jet fuel, because jets use it and they don't want to have 2 separate supply lines.

They've switched to regular diesel engines for MRAPs and JLTV (Humvee replacement), and I think future Abrams variants, so they are open to changing things up. Probably due to efficiency and cost, really. But you're right, the reliability of military-grade ICE engines will be difficult to replace this early for EVs.

That said, Phoenix-based startup Nikola Motor Company had worked with the Marine Corps to trial their electric [Reckless](https://nikolamotor.com/reckless) vehicle, so there's definitely an openness in the military to try it.

Edit: appears Humvee also ran diesel engines, as do several other vehicles. Abrams uses a gas turbine so it can use basically anything, and they feed it jet fuel. JP-8 is the primary fuel source used in virtually all U.S. military vehicles.

Edit2: it appears at least one U.S. Army official, who helps develop requirements for future acquisitions, thinks that in 10 years the Army [will have some fully-electric combat brigades](https://electrek.co/2017/10/18/us-army-electric-revolution-official-talks-all-electric-brigades/)."
"Agree. On top of that, it can be refueled on the go, which electric vehicles can't do."
"actually electric is much more reliable, why do you think thats superior? 
they had to buy gas from the enemy basicly several times -not good and can be avoided.

Most of the wars are in sun-countrys anyway"

"Aren't larger engines generally more efficient? I'm just basing this off the fact that the large 1000-1500hp engines used on MBTs weigh only around 1100-1800kg, with turbines being even better, like the M1's AGT1500 that offers 1500hp at 1130kg."

Ah you're probably right. Didn't consider the military aspect.
"I‚Äôm pretty sure if they are commissioning electric vehicles, they have already worked out the use case part of the process. 

The article states the order is for Model 3s, so these are probably just going to be used the same way government cars are now (I.e., driving in and around the local area). 

I seriously doubt anyone is trying to strap a gun on one of these and deploy them to a war zone."
"I‚Äôm aware of diesels flammability.

you‚Äôre assuming small arms fire. How about a [Raufoss round](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raufoss_Mk_211) from an anti-materiel rifle or literally anything more powerful than that? 

Will diesel stay inert around incendiaries like magnesium? See ‚Äúthe photo nobody would publish‚Äù - a tanker driver iirc

Batteries can armored relatively well, but even when they are ruptured, any number of Tesla fires show that while the batteries will ignite quickly with air, the fire does not spread catastrophically fast in most cases. Unlike liquid.

Splitting hairs? Maybe. Especially against rockets. I still choose battery delivery."

"I agree that in a lot of cases, military vehicles could battery powered, but in most wartime environments it'd be very hard to power them reliably compared to trucking in additional fuel. 

Both present logistical challenges, but realistically, most environments it's easier to use gas. 

Whether we should be in those environments is an entirely different question, and in almost all US domestica situations, I think BEV's make a TON more sense."
There is no higher complement for a truck.

We do fight non oil wars too.
"No it's not. Look at the power density of fuel and compare it to the weight, space and small amount of power the solar panels create.

It has a lightbar that looks like it's straight off of an undercover cop car. It was not built to have a unique aesthetic. It was built with complete disregard for aesthetic bc police/military don't care. The shape is 100% for structural integrity with the exoskeleton.

"HAWTHORNE, CA‚ÄîElon Musk, CEO of SpaceX Inc, The Boring Company, Neuralink, and Tesla Inc, has announced that all his companies will be merged and be renamed Cyberdyne Systems.

‚ÄúOur plan is to leverage our Cybertruck design to be fully autonomous Mars rovers, using SpaceX rockets as transports, all conducted with AI full self driving vehicles from start to finish. At no point will human intervention be required. Our machines got smart.

‚ÄúWe anticipate all goals to be achieved by early 2021.‚Äù He grinned. ‚ÄúFor real.‚Äù

Asked about his previous wariness about artificial intelligence, Musk smirked and said, ‚ÄúAt least I got there before Bezos. You can trust me. Honest.‚Äù He also revealed a new contract between the new Cyberdyne Systems and the Department of Defense‚Äôs SAC-NORAD division to supply Cybertrucks, exoskeletons equipped with not-flamethrowers, and rockets repurposed as ICBMs.

Musk also remarked that the planned Starlink satellite constellation would henceforth be named SkyNet, to better reflect its purpose as an internet network service in the skies."

I actually think MBTs will be phased out anyway. I mean modern conflicts are not MBT Battles it is against enemies that just aren't afraid to throw their life's away and shoulder mounted missiles eventually will get through armor. So a tank while it has a huge cannon that is actually not a good thing if you are fighting terrorists.
that marine vehicle is cool as hell. But looks like a fast attack craft not something that is designed to take any fire.
"The JP8 fuel is literally highly refined diesel, so you don't need a fancy special engine for it, any diesel engined vehicle in the US armed forces can run on it. And the Honeywell AGT1500 gas turbine on the Abrams can run on any burnable fluid."
"Jets run on pretty much everything.

So you use something that can be used in a diesel engine and then your army only needs one fuel."
I get it and I agree to a point. I‚Äôm getting into doomsday prepping and I will absolutely have a solar electric cybertruck set up over fossil fuels. But for warring purposes I just don‚Äôt see it. Not any time soon at least. ICE engines are more field repairable as well for now.
"They certainly use electric when it makes sense already.  Subs are basically EVs, or hybrids I suppose.  Some torpedos are EVs.

The military is going to consider all its options on any new piece of equipment, especially something like the US military where capability is the only concern."
"You're vastly disregarding the logistical issues of setting up a completely new network of infrastructure. Unlike with a civilian electric vehicle, if a military wants to use them, they are responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure around it.

And since nobody wants to be the idiot who got caught with their pants down as they are doing drastic changes to their infrastructure it is going to be a very slow process if it happens."
"Solar panels generate what?

300-400 watts per square meter in the best of conditions. So you need an absolute shitton of them. And you can no longer refuel in the field in 3 minutes. Which actually matters for warfare."
" 

I don't accept US military spending prices as proof positive of inefficiency in the technical method. I work with a TON of veterans in manufacturing and the stories i hear of finacnial waste are something else. specialty wrenches (without hydraulics or anything fancy just fucking wrenches) in the tens of thousands of dollars.

I get it the sun is reliable, but until the tech is better it won't replace ICE combat vehicles. I'm a tesla/elon lover, I want everyone in america to be driving electric yesterday. But combat vehicles is just a diff ballgame."
"I was more approaching it from you can design/size the engine for running at a steady efficient speed to generate slightly above average power needs for the vehicle, primarily to recharge the pack (so dropping the transmission and related drivetrain), and peak power would come from the battery system.

So more efficiency coming from not oversizing the engine, and not losing efficiency through throttling the engine or going through a transmission, and not needing the engine to idle (wasting fuel).  But I'm not an expert on turbine engines or tanks, so I might be not appreciating the unique setup."
"I mean, there are plenty of newer battery technologies that don't catch fire. Maybe Tesla will come out with such a chemistry in April? 

At that point, electric becomes a whole lot safer than fuel."
If you build it properly then it won't be a problem
You know the US border portal use raptors right? Look up some of the stuff they put those trucks through. Sure it's not armoured but we aren't talking about MRAPs.
"There is a huge misconception regarding ‚Äúmilitary grade‚Äù equipment.  The reality is that the military has really shitty equipment.  Not only is it shitty, it is also absurdly expensive. It‚Äôs like Harbor Freight quality but with Snap-on prices.

A modern military requires a huge amounts of oil and most countries don't have oil production to match that. Having a part of military run on electricity could be big for countries like Taiwan.
"I assume BEV military vehicles won't actually be used in combat environments (except for maybe something like recon where the stealth of electric propulsion could be used on ATVs and motorcycles). Militaries still need vehicles for plenty of non-combat transportation, and switching to a cheaper to maintain and cheaper to operate method like BEV probably makes perfect sense for that role. BEVs also probably make sense for law enforcement  in smaller towns and cities where they don't have to patrol long distances and they could use the extra frunk space to store more gear."

"There are huge number of variables, most military vehicles idle for long periods of time, no need for that for EVs, stealth is a thing too, having quiet military EVs can go a long way. I'm sure there is a case for some military EVs, scouts, forward recon, EVs operating out of a military base come to mind too.

"Good point. Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in part because the US embargoed their oil supplies. If you had a reliable source of electricity refueling could happen internally, like nuclear submarines and carriers."
I agree - it definitely makes sense for law enforcement and pretty much every military role except combat. It'd also work in a limited way for convoy & aid delivery I'd imagine.
"It depends, you have to factor in deployment time & cabling to support it and the ease with which it can be disrupted, then you also have to factor in how easily solar arrays can be damaged by say... artillery. Then you have to have space, it has to be the right time of day, and you need a battery storage device for your solar. 

I'm not saying it couldn't work on bases or in urban environments, but for actively moving units, it wouldn't be nearly as feasible as having a tanker come in every x amount of time or have resupply from a tanker off the coast with small scale replenishment vehicles. 

Look, I'm not in the services, but I know logistically a solar array in the field would present some rather unique challenges for non-static units."

Also I would like to say that I don‚Äôt think it is dumb to not have an MBT Programm asymmetrical is the future hopefully if not we should all start to prepare for the apocalypse. Military technology has gotten so far that most symmetrical warfare scenarios would Spirale out of control horribly. We are so damn lucky that that hasn‚Äôt happened with Ukraine yet. But if it does MBTs would not win that war."

Considering a large scale EMP can only be generated using a nuclear bomb (right now) I think there will be plenty of other issues other than technology not working.

"Yeah maybe if we were driving these tanks to work in LA, but its not like we have a ton of data on the effects of combat fire on electric systems. Not saying it cant be ultimately done."
"If your fuel trucks are moving through active warzones something has gone seriously and horribly wrong.

Besides, you're vastly underselling how difficult that would be. First off, we're not talking about the kind of solar panels you stick on your roof. You will need to power a fleet of dozens if not hundreds of vehicles that run on ~1500hp each and want a range of at least 400-500km on a 50-70t vehicle, that's ignoring the multitude of lighter vehicles. You'll need to set up a huge field of solar panels which could take weeks or even months and during that time the men and vehicles actually setting that thing up are very vulnerable and won't be able to supply whoever is supposed to protect them in the meanwhile.

After that you have yourself essentially a large powerplant somewhere near the enemy lines. Which will need constant extremely dense protection from air and artillery threats lest you want to lose it entirely (and that thing sure as hell wasn't cheap) within 10minutes of heavy bombardment. 


It's a logistical nightmare of the highest degree."
"Well, the US army and USMC often use the CH-47 and CH-53 to refuel their stuff."
"1. Keeping board electrics and hydraulics running is really important. So that EV is draining a few kW permanently just to stay useful.

2. By the time your engine is heard you are also visible by the naked eye and have been for some time. And you have been visible on thermal cameras for way longer. Scouting is also done from a few hundred yards away at a minimum when you are in a vehicle.

3. Except solar panels are fragile as fuck and wind turbines are tall. So they are easy to destroy. And the increase in base perimeter makes it way harder to defend."
"Battery swap a MBT?

That'll take ages."
Make sure the battery pack is not inside the vehicle. Make it modular and design the module to be sandwich between two armor plating. Design the module so that it will drop off the vehicle when it undergoes thermal runaway reaction. What you have is space armor with the space filled with graphite powder (anode) and metal oxide powder (cathode).
you think that cant be fixed with different cemestry or sepcial armore? ok
"I have a decent amount of first hand military experience but its mostly moot for this discussion. You're of course 100% correct in that fuel is crazy energy dense and distributing it to devices that need it mostly trivial, simple and understood.

Also, deploying large scale PV via meatsac and then needing to quickly move it, is non-trivial. 

That said, i was thinking more along the lines of an array like how satellites do it. Or how those automatic olive tree shaker machines work. 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hufzrSsCyI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hufzrSsCyI) 

Tank based bridge devices demonstrate how far you can extend a gantry. I havent run the math but i feel a significantly sized PV array could be deployed from a heavy vehicle in under 60s. You mention batteries, maybe they're used as ballast in the locomotion device.  

If you've made it this far into this mental sandbox response that im sure 4 humans will ever read lol, my drive is that ""one is able to pull energy from anywhere that there is sun"" Got sun? Got movement. Sure, you still need to wait for those shipments of 556 ammo, loo paper and food *(though thats not technically true)* The above arsepull idea, can literally extract energy from the light. PV can be setup to still work with a damaged panels due to rounds, mortar.

Unfortunately we end this fun thought with the fact that we're battery energy density limited. Aint nobody want to be the one who ok'd lower range military vehicles...

I enjoyed typing this blurb :)"
"Agreed 100%, thanks"
"Thank you friend, that was interesting. High power micro reactors would be nice. High power fusion would be nice. I hope i live long enough to see fusion and i hope that almost free ubiquitous power changes the world and allows us to explore the space around Sol."

"usually subjective? I think it's just that we hear about the corruption much more than the plain old boring normal government procurements.

Might be wrong, my experience is with federal IT procurement and anything over ~$150k gets pretty good oversight (by good oversight I mean it's a PITA, no-one lets me buy what I want and there is red tape everywhere)."
"Of course they're not a war-winning weapon that doesn't require support, such a thing doesn't exist.

Nothing provides the staying power and reliable all purpose firepower of an MBT. 

Symmetrical warfare =|= nuclear warfare. What has been going on in the Ukraine can by any means be described as symmetrical warfare and MBTs have been vital to both sides.

But hey, you don't have to listen to my opinion, I'm just some rando on the internet. It's just that the military of every more or less major country in the world agrees with me. The Armata and T-90M are entering trials and service respectively. Germany and France are co-developing a next-generation MBT that should be ready before 2035, whilst putting out newer modernisations of their existing tanks (like the Leopard 2A7V). The US are switching over to a new variant of the Abrams with the M1A2C. The UK are looking at a significant renovation to their Challenger IIs, standardizing them more with current and future NATO MBTs. Turkey and India are developing their homegrown designs with the Altay and Arjun respectively. Pretty much every country that is feeling threatened by its neighbours is continuing to buy better and better Russian and Chinese surplus vehicles. Even South East Asian, South American and Scandinavian countries, which have always had relatively little need for heavy vehicles due to the terrain are buying upgraded Leopard 2s and producing very modern and expensive tanks themselves in the case of South Korea and Japan. And of course older Soviet and Chinese surplus is still the name of the game in any African conflict.


I'm not saying that MBTs will remain with us until the sun explodes and we all die, but I'm anything but alone when I speculate that MBTs will exist for many, many decades to come."

"Arguably, you will be able to transport just as much useful energy in 10 years with a military grade tesla semi and the megapack formfactor trailer. 

For example, a Humvee gets 4-8 mpg (city-highway), and a large tank truck holds 11,600 gallons. So we get 92,800 maximum miles per full tank truck.

If we do a tesla semi with megapack on top [Example of Mobile charging station](https://teslamotorsclub.com/blog/2019/12/02/long-charging-lines-during-holiday-travel-highlight-growing-ev-adoption/), that's 3000 Kwh. At expected cybertruck miles per kwh of somewhere between 2-3 miles/kwh, we get a maximum hauled range of 9,000. So roughly 10% as of today.

&#x200B;

I don't expect tesla to improve vehicle efficiency too much more, so I'll stick with 3 m/kwh. As for the energy density in 10 years. Probably not more than a doubling, so we're talking Maybe 20,000 miles hauled per truck. 

Not as much, but definitely makes the logistics much more doable. Refueling time might become a bottleneck obviously, and other considerations I'm missing like overheating and such."
"it doesn't take long to do a battery swap on an electric bike, cordless drill, or an old smartphone, or anything designed to be swappable.

It would be pretty awesome to do it with air suspension, toolless, and without any personnel. The refueling truck places it down, waits for you to swap, picks up the old one and carries it pack to the solar charger field. 

having no personnel would be doubly beneficial assuming that we are moving as much as we can to drone wars.

or again, just glass the infidels from space."
"So you're suggesting we put the thing that ensures propulsion into the most vulnerable place available and compromise the protection of the entire vehicle at the same time?

That would be like deciding that ammo cook-offs are such a great threat that all ammunition should be stored outside of the tank.

It will offer an advantage in a very specific aspect of a very specific situation, but it will also hamstring your entire design and ensure that pretty much every hit, even if it doesn't penetrate any compartments will be a mission kill, by crippling the tank and leaving it vulnerable to further attack."
"No, no it can't. If a tungsten rod busts into that thing at Mach 5, it *will* ignite."
"Your comment made me curious, do I went looking.  From what I found, it's generally true, but [it looks like it varies with composition and treatment.](https://www.kimballphysics.com/magnetic-response-of-stainless-steels)"
"Federal IT procurement is one of the most overly governed and mostly corrupt there is.

Subjectivity is not a bad thing when it comes to compliance. There is no corruption as long as everything is properly documented.

My point is probably some director wanted teslas and were able to make them fit their budget. Lets not overreach in terms of compliance, its a car. If it has the right range and the right price tag, they will buy the car they prefer."
Oh! thanks
"You are adding a ton of complexity to your ""fueling"" method with an EV. It's way easier to guzzle fuel into a tank then to charge in the middle of nowhere. Someone can meet you and you can fuel up in minutes in the field, depending on the type of vehicle, there is really nothing that can go wrong.

In the civilian world it's not as big of a deal, worst case you use a supercharger or someone else's wall outlet. That's not the case for the military.

And as any engineer who has worked in the industry would know, ""less parts = less problems"" as a blanket statement is not true at all."
"I was thinking about people doing it.

With battery packs that work for a whole range of vehicles."
"Nope. Batteries don't all have to be lumped together in one pack. You can have, say, 20 different slabs of them around the vehicle. Any particular hit (that penetrates the outer armor) would only take out 1/20th of your power supply.  


And the advantage is not very specific, but rather very general. Electric motor is much lighter than gas engine + fuel tank, so if the batteries are serving double-duty as armor, you are saving weight overall. Saving weight means you can have more armor and/or more  cargo/weapons."
That is why it needs to be modular. A hit will kill a module but with enough module you only reduce available power by small amount. The key is not connecting the module in series but connect them in parallel. So if the tank has 20 modules. 10 on each side even if you hit the tank 10 times and kill 10 modules on the left side it still has half the power and you need to maneuver to the right and hit the tank again 10 times to effectively kill it. But if the module is swappable and reinforcement arrive it will run again the next day by swapping in fresh modules.
"The Merkava literally carries it's engine on the front as aditional protection, and the Abrams prevents ammo cook-off with low resistance panels."
yes but if that happens to a normal tank engine that thing is also done and will most likley also ignite.. whats the point?
Yes but that's still *many* magnitudes lower than normal steel. A magnet may stick but you won't get a useful amount of force.
you are definitely thinking like an army engineer :P
"So your mobility isn't necessarily gone (unless all of your wiring meets a disastrous end, which is a fairly common occurence in combat). 

You've still got yourself armor that will start electrical fires all over the vehicle and will be less protective than a real composite.

The weight savings are an important advantage, but they are the only reason I say that it will simply take rather long for such systems to see service, rather than it being completely impossible. The additional danger of electrical fires, losing out on the very useful protective qualities of fuel tanks and the by far biggest factor: the gigantic infrastructural rework it would require, are all still there and will remain for the foreseeable future.

I'd also add that there's a technological issue of making electric powerpacks with the necessary power output. At the moment, I'm not aware of any electric systems that come even close to the power requirements of an MBT."
Whilst you're covered in electrical fires and have weaker protection than a conventional tank. It's better to have as much of your powerpack under armour as possible.
"But the engine is *behind* the armor, not an integral part of it. And unlike a battery it doesn't cause dangerous electrical fires when it gets shot. That design decision was mainly influenced by the Merkava having a limited APC capacity with a large double door in the back. Practically all APCs have the engine in front, because they carry troops in the back.

And I have no idea what you want to say with the blow-out panels? Yes, it has those, in what way is it relevant to this discussion? On a side-note, they don't prevent ammo cook-off, they offer an escape route for all the fire and gas to leave the vehicle without roasting everything on its way out."
"An electrical fire is more volatile and more difficult to extinguish. Especially diesel reacts very favourably when hit by high-speed projectiles and is surprisingly good at stopping spall. Which is why ammunition racks are surrounded by fuel tanks in some designs (including the T-54/55, which is rather in/famous for being the most produced tank in history and seeing combat in pretty much every war since its conception)."
"Go pour some diesel on a concrete slab and try to ignite it.

Until you get out the weedburner or torch it won't burn."
The flexibility of swapping modules is more important than powerpack protection. The option of calling a fresh load of fully charge modules to keep on going in critical battles will determine whether you win or loss in some encounter. This will also allow trickle charging the modules on forward base where power can be unreliable while the tank is fighting on the frontline. You either swap modules or you swap tanks.
"The Merkava having limited personnel carrying capabilities is not what forced the engine to the front, it is the other way around. Placing the engine on the front for extra protection created a space on the back in which you can carry stuff or troops."
"May be, I'm no expert on the development cycle of the Merkava, what does it matter?"
"Looks awesome. Can't wait for Tesla to start rolling these out in a big way. Trucks are not an emotional purchase, it's all about reliability and cost per mile - these are all areas where EVs excel."
The Semi better have a badass horn as there are going to be lots of kids (and me) pumping our arms up and down when we see these bad boys on the road.
"i would like to see what is hauling that, is that another tesla semi?"
Pretty sure they do their cold weather testing at their test track in Alaska no?
"Hear me out, aerogel insulated battery packs"
"Business plan:

Buy Tesla Semis and start trucking business.

Hometown is rural with lots of logging trucks and semis hauling RVs from our town‚Äôs biggest (and lowest paying) employer. Hire downtrodden experienced drivers for business.

"If they wanted to cold-weather test, they'd go through the 'Peg"
I haven't been so excited about trucks since I was a kid trying to get them to honk
"The article goes into detail of the distance from Huntingdon Quebec to Abbotsford BC. 

The Huntingdon border crossing is in Abbotsford. 
Both photos were taken at the same place."
Was the dual color something they have showed before? That seems new and looks nice
"If they were ""Cold Weather Testing"" you'd think they'd take it somewhere cold not Abbottsford... where the average January temp is 43 degrees.  Even Hungtington, Quebec's average January temp is 24.  No, they could find much colder places in much of the northern US for cold weather testing.  This is purely for demos to potential customers.

But ya know, for most Americans, Canada = igloos"
I want tesla and twin turbskis to team up for one vehicle.
Man I wish they were like one year further along on the Semi. My dad is in the market for a new truck for his company and would have considered one.
"Hope maybe they bring back light silver for the other cars, it‚Äôs a popular color and it feels like it‚Äôd fit with the rest of the lineup."
I'd have rather they have gone this route with the pickup design than the 'Stealth Fighter with bullet proof glass' look they chose.
This vehicle changes the whole long-haul game.
"This was spotted in Whitehorse, Yukon yesterday."
Steering wheel looks like the one in that recent patent.  Do we think their are capacitive buttons that light up under it?

I love how it's spotted on a flat bed being towed by a diesel semi.
I honestly read that as ‚Äúand silent demos‚Äù.
Come to the twin cities! We're gonna hit negative teens tonight and tomorrow!
Is Tesla building any infrastructure for charging these beasts?  It‚Äôs not practical for them to charge at any of the supercharger stations that I have visited because they are mostly designed for cars backing into a spot.
Has there been a discussion on where these things are going to charge. Last thing I want to see is a semi pulled up to a supercharger blocking it with its trailer.
I will test it in MN. Let me know.
"I only truck on the weekends now, please give me a rig that can knock off 1000kms between charges with a 137,000lb GVW and the balls to pull sail load through the Laurentians. I am so fucking sick of hearing diesel engines."

How do they charge it though I assume truckers wouldn‚Äôt have time to wait hours for a charge multiple times a week compared to regular gas stations?
Canadian here. Good luck Tesla lmao
Tesla does its cold weather testing in South Carolina.
"Looking at the picture in the article, that's a lot of cabin humidity if you ask me."
I‚Äôm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you meant *start* rolling these out in a big way.
">Trucks are not an emotional purchase

A few million truckers might fight you on those words."
">it's all about reliability and cost per mile - these are all areas where EVs excel.

That's a very subjective opinionated fact. For me, owning a model 3, has been the MOST problematic vehicle I've ever owned. And this is coming from someone who owns a Toyota, Honda and Hyundai (sold)."
[deleted]
"Another thought I have is the savings in insurance costs. I‚Äôm imagining that between the driving aids Tesla has engineered, alongside the ability of an EV to react and respond much faster than gas (traction/stability control, etc.) PLUS the fact that there won‚Äôt be a massive engine perched up and out over the front of the truck, we will see a dramatic reduction in tip overs and damage to the truck, cargo, and other drivers. This is completely my own conjecture though...anybody else?"
*light duty EVs excel. We‚Äôll see if Tesla can make a product that costs less per mile to operate where other heavy duty manufacturers can‚Äôt. Transit buses are coming in at much higher costs per mile than their ICE brethren.
"> Can't wait for Tesla to start rolling these out in a big way

Every single tree and bush around the world would need to fruit lithium ion cells 7x24x365 and that still wouldn't be enough for large scale series production of purely BEV powered 18-wheelers. Tesla Semi apparently has 6 (six) model3 long range battery trays inside, that comprises like 33k pieces ""fat AA"" lithium cells in total.

They would also need a network of mega-giga-chargers that can provide 1MW over the umbilical to serve Semis. Current most advanced charger station, the Ionity has 1MW main transformer in 4-stalls version and each umbilical provides 350kW peak power. Such an assembly costs 500.000 euros (540k USD) to buy and install, provided the mains utility doesn't need upgrades in the vicinity to serve such power needs and in case they do, you have to pay extra... How much a Tesla Semi rapid charger will cost? Electrification of highways for direct e-traction and charging-on-the-go may make more sense, allowing for smaller and fewer battery packs."

I was thinking about this. I pitched it to few friends and they laughed me off. I think its a bible business
I'd love be one of your drivers if this takes off for you. I'm younger and getting my license in one month to prep to drive a Tesla semi as a goal in my life before retirement.
I know a couple truck guys who are in it they say it‚Äôs rough. But it‚Äôs better no to own the vehicles for liability reasons. Create a Company that can helps other with the translation to electric semi‚Äôs & vans. Your idea is good though! I‚Äôm however live in a very corporate warehouse area
Article said sightings in Quebec and BC
"I heard about it being in Ashcroft, BC"
It was just seen in the Yukon.  Apparently the driver said that it was enroute to Alaska.  I have a screenshot of the fb post..but font know how to share that.
Winterpeg.
Ya this was in Ashcroft and it wasn't very cold this week lol
Tesla cars should have an option anytime they go by a semi to have it do tricks like honk or use the side of the truck as a huge tv.... or something
"> Also this is not a two-toned Tesla Semi prototype, this is the same Silver prototype with top cover removed during travel to reduce the height of the truck and avoid unnecessary weight and drag while tied to a trailer bed, interestingly, the manufacturer license plate of the Tesla Semi is also stripped-off e which we norally witness on Tesla prototypes moving around in the United States."
"Seems pretty clear its on a truck from California to Alaska. Spotted in Abbotsford at the border, and next at Ashcroft, BC (i.e. moving North). The author of the article appears to be an idiot as there were no sightings in Quebec... Huntingdon is the name of the border crossing town in BC (same place as Abbotsford)."
"Heading north from Abby on a trailer. The insinuation is it's being trucked to Alaska.

Ignore the Quebec angle of the article - author can't google."
It was also it Ashcroft which is about 270 km away. Winter's there are on avg colder than Abbotsford. But yea I agree it's most like demos
V3 supercharging through.
"Well when the model s first came out it had no vents for defrost!  Windshield woud fog up. And to top it off heated mirrors, and cold weather package were upgrades in Canada when they should be standard."
"Any place north of Calgary, Alberta right now would be an option."
"That‚Äôs nice. I‚Äôm glad they didn‚Äôt and have never been more excited for a car. I‚Äôll take the lower cost due to simpler manufacturing, combined with stronger construction that doesn‚Äôt negatively affect the unprecedented aerodynamics. Form follows function. To each his/her own."
"short haul is where it could shine, its gonna be too heavy to be useful for long haul as it decreases your potential load by too much.

Unless you only haul paper towels these things make much more sense for distribution to the end user markets as this is also where you dont wanna have a ton of emissions."
"> Supposed to be some sort of ""megacharger"" which would be at dedicated depots.

This ^. Will need to have dedicated fast chargers for more than just local traffic."
I think the majority of these vehicles will be charged at warehouse is in under 45 minutes
Currently they are disconnecting the trailer to use the existing superchargers. Once they are in production they will have dedicated superchargers. But right now they do have to connect to 4 superchargers at the same time so that might be inconvenient depending on the location.
"The last leaked email update mentioned that Tesla is working with CharIn (developers of CCS) on a new charging standard for heavy commercial vehicles.

Probably this: https://www.charinev.org/hpccv/?no_cache=1"
"Supposed to be some sort of ""megacharger"" which would be at dedicated depots."
"The [500 mi range was estimated *while* towing 80,000 lbs](https://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2017/11/tesla-semi-debuts-500-miles-range-80000-lb-towing-capacity.html) so it stands to reason tractor only could get a lot more than that."
Truckers adhere to strict drive time limits per day. As long as it can drive further than they can get in a days worth of driving they can charge overnight if need be.
"I had friends who hauled trailers for about eight years in the US. There's a limit to how much they can drive per day as well as per week. 

I don't know the specifics, but they did take frequent stops, even if not specifically planned for refueling. 

All that said, I don't know that these are really meant for constant cross country trips. I think they're meant for shorter trips, such as delivery goods from a distribution center and etc."
I think that the freight terminals will have chargers as well so trucks can be charged there too.  This would be ideal trucking company doing local deliveries or shorter runs.
"Truckers have to sleep too, they don‚Äôt just truck 24/7."
Pretty sure that's just paper or some kind of light adhesive backed material stuck against the interior of the windows to keep prying eyes from spying.

"yea but thats another american thing, in Europe its the norm that you drive a truck but you dont own it because the company provides it for you.

This saves tons of money and doesnt make the trucker ""independent contractors"" to get around all kinds of stuff you had to pay if they were your employee."
"They might, but company managers will purchase them on routes where they will make more money and work logistically.  That will be more then Tesla can make."
"Yup....lots of good paying jobs, GONE....and the trucking companies wonder why there is a shortage of drivers. Kind of hard to start a career when you see your replacement being fine tuned to replace u"
5 service visits in 9 months here. Still waiting for them to contact me regarding two more issues :/
"What problems?  (I've owned my Model 3 for a week as at tomorrow).

My most ever problematic vehicle was an F-350 whose engine blew at 8,200 KM.  it was in the shop for 4 months of its first year on the road.."
"Uh you do realize that Toyota and Honda are like two of the most reliable vehicles manufacturers, right? 

So saying ""this is coming from someone who owns..."" really doesn't give the statement weight. 

Secondly the things you mention as being problems with your Model 3 aren't about EVs specifically. Those same problems would be there whether Tesla was producing an EV or ICE vehicle. If you have the same company manufacture an ICE vehicle and an EV, the EV WILL have less need of service due to the powertrain. It's pretty much an undeniable fact. EVs just have less moving parts and an electric motor is much more reliable than an ICE.

The real problems you have is the fact that Tesla is a startup who is manufacturing its first ever mass-market vehicle. And depending when you bought it, that youth really reared it's ugly head. Now the main problem is mostly limited to Paint issues and maybe some rattles..."
"oh, sorry to hear that. Was it drivetrain related? Or with the rest of the vehicle?"
"That's too bad. My 3 has been extremely reliable. No service in almost 2 years and 26,000 miles."
"Well its not an opinionated fact.  Since early 2019 the reliability of the Model 3 has been above average and has improved throughout its life.   The early 2018 cars had many issues, though the majority where cosmetic.  Cars purchased today are very reliable."
When was yours built? I have a Sep 2018 and it‚Äôs been smooth sailing.
"These are not meant for super long distance trucking. Range is 500 miles I believe.

Not all truckers are travelling across continents all the time. Some are doing regular routes of 500 miles or less. 
At this rate of progress, we will see 1000 mile range trucks on the market before the decade is out."
"There are many different kinds of truck routes.  This will be a Walmart truck for sure, distribution center to store.  They have shorter routes, more consistent locations for charging and are willing to spend more now to save money later.  

Between the companies that run these types of routes, all production will be purchased for the first few years."
A lot depends on where you are. Diesel currently costs ¬£1.40 /Litre or roughly 7 USD/gallon where I am (UK). Hardly difficult to beat.
"Is is really necessary to charge so fast? Trucks have mandatory rest periods of around 10 hours per day, as long as they can get a full charge in that time it's fine."
haha - It would take a very stubborn person to incur higher costs and therefore make less per delivery just to be able to brag about the size of your engine. Eventually they won't be able to compete and will have to join the revolution anyhow.
that's because EV trucks don't exist in any meaningful way at the moment.
"It's polite, it's right..."
Please god no.
"The truck can regen at a pretty high rate. There would be some sudden stops or road conditions where you need to apply trailer brakes but they should be few and far between. Downshifting and jake brake are common and truck only regen will be a far superior drop in replacement.

Customers do not want to buy trailers that are specific to a certain tractor."
that would make the trailer massively expensive and add weight which reduces the weight you can load onto the trailer.
"[Bosch is/will sell electrified axles](https://www.bosch-mobility-solutions.com/en/products-and-services/commercial-vehicles/powertrain-systems/electrified-axle/) for new or retrofit onto trailers.  SAF Holland as well.  I don't see why Tesla wouldn't eventually offer them

Benefits of regenerative braking, improve traction and handling, and self-navigation of parking lots and loading bays.  \[And for diesel trucks, using it as a generator to power fridge/freezer trailers purportedly saving  ‚Ç¨10K a year on diesel - ie it would be a benefit a mixed fleet of EV and Diesel, which would be a selling feature\]

/u/ffiarpg /u/Pixelplanet5"
"Probably Tesla semi is not roadlegal in every state. It would be reasonable to have such trailer that can regenerate, otherwise it wouldnt make range specs."
"The photo I saw from Ashcroft BC (and the ones in the article) had it on a flatbed. Don't expect they're doing any charging along the way.

~~I wonder if our Canadian laws prevent it from being driven here yet, and that's why it's being trailered to Alaska?~~

Edit: Or, or or, this just occurred to me (actually another post pointed it out), the fact that there are no Superchargers north of Hope (on the route they're evidently taking) might require it to use as little juice as possible before getting to the AK proving grounds."
Insulation is good when it's hot out too! If outside temp is 40C and you want your battery at 30C for example.
i‚Äôll invest 50% of costs let‚Äôs be partners
"its pretty obvious why they laugh, its not like you get the trucks and infrastructure needed for free.

So the cost of starting this business is easily in the high millions as you will also need your own chargers and a place to charge the trucks.

Then you need to find customers that want to haul a load on relatively short distance as a new player on the market.

you may be able to up sell a bit if you find customers that care about their carbon footprint and offer hauls with 100% solar energy for example.

And then after all of this it will take you easily a decade if not more to break even on the buy in price and at that point it remains to be seen if the trucks battery is still good or needs a swap."
Offer them the right pay and they‚Äôll ditch their conventions
Until tesla starts their own robotruck business

"The article says ""at the Canadian border"" and in Ashcroft, BC, implying its on its way up to Alaska testing grounds."

"Oh the Sumas border crossing?  He called that Huntingdon?  Lived in the lower mainland for 20 years, crossed that border a bunch of times and never knew that little area was called Huntingdon! Ha!

Makes sense..."

On its way to Alaska. It was never in Quebec."
"""To each his/her own""  Indeed. Everybody has different tastes.  Somebody out there actually loves their Nissan Cube."
"The article doesn‚Äôt say at what speed the 500 miles is possible...

I hope it‚Äôs a huge success, it just seems unbelievable."
I‚Äôm no trucker but I‚Äôd be down to from a shuttle service back and forth Toronto-Ottawa with one of these. About a full work day round trip.
Yup
If you add up all the sense from that sentence you could make a nickle wprth fo kunfucion
I took it as stop rolling them out in a pompous way and in a more logical and statistical way
"I have a relative who is a trucker.  He started as an employee but saved up to get his own truck specifically so he could become an independent contractor.  So both routes are available in the U.S.  It may seem counter intuitive to want to be an independent contractor, but the money is much better that way (bigger risk and bigger reward)."
"As an independent contractor in the US I very much enjoy not being an employee.

Not a trucker, but I bet many are happy to be independent."
I'm fairly certain in the UK we have truckers who own their trucks. It is just not anywhere near as popular to work that way.
">get around all kinds of stuff you had to pay if they were your employee.

No, they just get the drivers from the poorest countries and pay them a fraction of what a normal salaries would be in the countries they drive in (France, Germany, etc.)."
Sure. But the company rewards good drivers with good trucks.
"Stop progress guys, jobs need to be saved"
"Damn, I've had 13 total service visits since ownership. And that doesn't include the amount of times I had to drive up there to get something rectified without a PDF being sent over to me."
"Rattles, trim fitment, panel misalignments, inner wiring in areas where they shouldn't be, paint defects, clips in a variety of areas missing, and lastly whenever I bring my Tesla to get these issues addressed they damage something that lead to something else getting damage, and the next thing getting damaged and the next. A never ending cycle of the service center FUCKING up in Littleton, CO."
That's what I've been saying throughout my comments if you have gone through them.
Here's my reply to someone else asking the same question: https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/f2shoq/tesla_semi_truck_spotted_in_canada_for_possible/fheqlua?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
not true because I see a lot of showroom cars that are made recently this year and they still have quality control issues.

"Fuel is definitely a piece of it, failed components are another. The significantly higher gross vehicle weight puts things like power electronics through the ringer."
"Trucks are expensive, so they are usually run with 2-3 rotated crews for 7/24 ops, as long as the equipment side can hold up (checks, repairs, refurbishment of tech)"
But mah Jake brake goes BWAAAAAAAAAAAA
"*selects Mad Max Mode*

""beep beep **motherfucker**"""
"A loaded Semi is 20x the weight of a Model 3 but the semi only has 4x the number of engines.  even if the regen is mostly limited by battery size, Semi should have only ~13x larger battery (1000kwh). Chances are the regen will be 2.5-5x lower in loaded semi vs Model 3."
"And yet at least 2 companies are bringing electrified axels to market for new and retrofit (Bosch, SAF Holland)"
I'm waiting for the official specs to confirm but I'd imagine the truck loses alot of weight not having an ICE engine.. I'd love to compare once we get more details.
">It would be reasonable to have such trailer that can regenerate, otherwise it wouldnt make range specs.

If it doesn't meet range specs it won't be because of a lack of trailer regen."
Range doesn‚Äôt include regen in it though?
Uh... How do you figure?
[deleted]
Lets discuss this if you are serious
"Agreed, Nothing is free. There is an overhead in terms of adapting to new technology but that shouldn‚Äôt be a deterrent to give it a go.

This could be very well a money making business comparing maintenance and upkeep cost over a diesel truck."
Sounds like it was spotted in Abbotsford shortly after so I'm guessing they didn't. It must have been coming from up north
I think it was just the geoteg from Twitter. In Google maps the area shows up as Huntingdon.
*snaps fingers* YES!
"As I see it, it's the difference between desiring freedom and desiring safety (security as a form of safety in this case).

My admittedly non-comprehensive personal experience is those that prefer freedom understand the other's preference, but those that prefer safety think the the rest are mental and/or stupid."
"yea but id say its still better to get paid regardless if there's a haul for you and having things like insurance.

People probably also like to be an employee more in Germany for example because that gives you all kinds of advantages like sick days and minimum holidays while being independent gives you none of these unless you accept not making any money during that time."
"Seems like a candidate for a lemon law buyback. I have owned mine for a year and 7 months and have never seen the inside of a service center, outside of tire rotations."
"Not to take away from your very frustrating reality in the context of a personal vehicle; in a working commercial application this stuff just doesn't matter.  Save maybe missing clips could precipitate reliability issues with a chaffing harness or something.  But otherwise with all those imperfection the vehicle performs identically to a perfect vehicle when it comes to getting the job done.  An EV is so much more simple that the ""get from A to B"" factor is through the roof, which was the OC's point."
"None of this is the fault of EVs in general, though. Or even Tesla in general. You got a single bad egg, and your service center sucks. That's not generalizable across EVs or Tesla."
[deleted]
"This is the same issues with all three of my friends Model 3‚Äôs who made fun of me 2 years ago for still wanting ICE motors. 

They can‚Äôt even keep their cars for 2 months at a time with out some ridiculous service to replace the headliner, dome lights, cup holders, etc. The build quality of the cars are absolute shit for what they are supposed to be."
"Okay, but I'm just saying comparing the Model 3, which is manufactured by a new startup (in the grand scheme of auto companies) making it's first mass-market vehicle, to companies that are at the top of the reliability rankings - Toyota and Honda, makes it so it's not surprising that you have more problems than you've ever dealt with. In fact I'd say it's completely unrealistic to think that the Model 3 wouldn't have more problems (with basic manufacturing stuff like fit/paint/etc) than those vehicles. However, You also shouldn't take the Model 3's problems and place that on all EVs, and I also wouldn't even say that those problems they experienced to this point will follow them to even the Model Y or Cybertruck or whatever else they produce. The 1 thing that I wouldn't expect to improve all that much is the Paint Shop in Fremont. I think it's just going to be bad, period - and that's why they switched to White as the main color which hides a lot of defects well. Paint Shops are EXTREMELY expensive to setup/upgrade, Like they're the most expensive part of any auto plant.

But you also have to weight the pros with the cons here. Like do the cons of some rattles (that I'm sure are easy to fix if you watch some Youtube Videos, and Tesla will fix if under warranty), some paint defect in places that don't actually matter (and again that Tesla will fix under warranty), or some other minor problem outweight the pros that come with owning it like getting OTA updates FOR FREE, environmentally friendly, having the best charging infrastructure, etc? For the majority of people the positives far outweight the negatives, and for a company manufacturing it's first mass market vehicle, that's pretty great. And chances are the reliability of the vehicles will improve with experience, which is why the Model Y is shaping up to be the best vehicle Tesla has ever manufactured - and likely most successful."
"Sorry, reliability surveys, Tesla financial statements and general observation say otherwise."
"Yes. If we use the US as an example, a driver can only drive for 11 hours in a 14 hour period before being required to take a break. 11 hours at 60 miles / hour (as a rough guide, it will be less ofc) = 660 miles. After that a 10 hour rest is required.
Provided there is somewhere to charge 10 hours should be plenty of time to charge up again. A range of about 800 miles should allow for cold weather and an additional buffer. I'd say we were 2-3 years away from that kind of range being possible. It really will be game over for ICE trucks when that happens."
"There are rumors that Tesla is working on a new type of Superchsrger specifically for the Semi: a Megacharger. We know very little about it, but I imagine they'll start putting them up fairly soon, since the Semi is supposed to start getting into customers' hands by the end of the year."
"With battery tech getting better each year, these trucks will become viable for an increasing number of use cases with each year that passes."
"Really? Here in Europe ""team driving"" is extremely rare.  Not sure about in other areas, but if a delivery here is extremely urgent you can get the goods delivered in this way, but the cost is double the usual rate."
That's more like Samuel L Jackson mode.
"Regen isn't limited by battery size or motors. The Model 3 could technically lock all the wheels up with regen alone, but won't for obvious reasons. They won't allow higher regen using the pedal as it would make it much tougher to control. 

Source: people use Model 3 drive units in their EV conversions and have a drift button that just turns regen up to max. I've also inspected the amount of energy delivered back into the battery pack by regen. You usually see around 85kw at max regen. For reference, v3 super chargers charge at 250kw peak."
Our semi design at a competitor uses a giant resistor to Regen even beyond the capabilities of our battery. It all goes into waste heat but it still improves brake life.
"Regen is not about motor size, it is about battery size.  Also, truckers brake differently then auto drivers and will almost certainly be better at using regen."
"A 6 cylinder truck diesel weights less than a ton, a V10 still way under two tons.
The 85kWh batter from tesla weights 600kg and the semi will have far more than that.

According to current estimations the battery is expetec to weight over 11tons making up one third of the cargo capacity.
It remains to be seen how much batteries they actually put in there."
"Well we do not know if the Tesla setup has a transmission but some figure around 2800-3200 lbs for the larger 14-16L six cylinder motor.  However you do have about seven pounds per gallon of diesel fuel so if the tanks are 100-250 gallons, one per side, you can get more weight to play with for batteries."
Gains a metric fuck tonne of weight in batteries to offset that
"True, lower insulation is probably better most of the time, especially if you consider extra cost, weight and drag."
"We did it, reddit"
"100% my experience -most asume ""strupid, because they will be homeless soon!!"""
"AFAIK you can't lemon law over rattles or panel alignment, the vehicle still drives just fine and you'd have trouble showing that this tanks the resale value.  Tesla can easily get a CarMax offer and show it's consistent with average."
"I'm not eligible for the lemon law due to the vehicle not being in the condition to where it's within the lemon law territory. I've considered it and mentioned it to the service center but nothing can really be rectified. because the issues I'm having are being fixed either the second or third time, but every time I receive my vehicle back they always screw something else up and not acknowledge most of the issues they have caused. And most of those issues are all them damaging the interior of my vehicle or putting things into place that aren't fitted correctly.

That's why I just want to sell my vehicle and just drive my Honda for a couple of years and look for some other EV that'll be more reliable/better quality, like a Toyota (whenever they get off their asses and move to BEVs already.)"
"In many states, lemon law only applies to the same issue reoccurring. A car with many distinct issues may not qualify."
">  I have owned mine for a year and 7 months and have never seen the inside of a service center

1) as it should be. Your car isn't even 2 years old

2) get an inspection appointment anyway. Just because you drive an EV doesn't mean there's no maintenance. Inspection intervals are still the same. You still have tires, springs, shock absorbers, wheel bearings, power steering, brakes, brake fluid, AC, ...."
"Does it get the job done, yes. But I'm not pushing it's inability to perform the job. By all means it CAN perform. It's the fact that Tesla themselves haven't put quality in their vehicles."
Not sure how when I go view Tesla's in showrooms and see their quality control issues right then and there.
"I've been saying that the vehicle doesn't have any mechanical issues. It's all cosmetic, trim, alignment, paint, and rattles."
"That's also not completely true. What about the Issues with steering, suspension on the S, problems with the falcon-doors on the X. I am not bashing Tesla and I also know that others have similar issues. My Audi A4 was riddled with problems, every once in a month another sensor died. I'm now driving a Alfa Giulia and so far I am happy with it - 1 minor fault was resolved with an ECU Update and that's it - 3 years old wit 50k km and going strong."
">This is the same issues with all three of my friends Model 3‚Äôs who made fun of me 2 years ago for still wanting ICE motors. 

That's not a valid argument though. If you'd said ""made fun of me for not wanting a Tesla"", then sure. They are notorious for poor trim and fit. You'll 100% have less trouble with the doors or cup holders in almost any other brand.

But BEV drivetrains in general - even today - are simply more reliable than even the most reliable ICE. It's just not possible for an ICE to *not* start failing after a painfully short amount of time due to the fact that you have thousands of moving parts that need to maintain very tight tolerances in size (wear rate needs to be perfectly uniform), operating in a high temperature, dust filled environment. Parts *will* rapidly wear, non-uniformly, and failures will occur. It can't be stopped. Modern BEVs have their own issues, but even at this early point in their development cycle they're fundamentally less prone to failure over the short term than ICEs.

So while it's perfectly acceptable to not want a Tesla for a variety of reasons (I'll probably never get one, personally), you shouldn't hold a bias against BEVs in general."
The 97% satisfaction rate says you are full of shit.
"Yes! Yes they freakin are! Thank you! When I drive my Toyota or Honda, I'm SHOCKED by the build quality in them, especially when you close the doors. When closing the doors on the model 3, they sound ridiculously loud compared to my Toyota and Honda, where they sound flush and quiet."
"The point I'm getting at is if I'm spending 60K on a vehicle, heck, even 20K, I expect the vehicle to be in pretty good, if not great shape. I shouldn't expect any paint defects, misalignments, rattles, trim issues, and deformities in the material, like I have so early on.

Also I don't see how the model y will be their most successful vehicle. I truly see the Cybertruck being their most successful due to it not having aliminium."
"I believe these are official, not rumors. They'll charge at 1MW."
"American 18-wheelers are usually equipped with a rest compartment in the aerodynamic fairing over the driving cab. Depending on which US states they cross it may be used while on the move, so 2 people could take turns driving almost continously."
Beep beep Monday to Friday!
"This is with a custom controller, right? Any links you could share or info about controllers that are capable of this?"
You work for Nikola motors?
What competitor is there? I have not read any news on another EV Semi? Super interested in this.
Wait... What .. 11tons of battery? Holy shit
Do you know how much?
"It is interesting because you and I have totally different experiences. I had nothing but issues with Toyota (I ended up selling back my Avalon through lemon law.. massive electrical and transmission issues). While my Model X has been the most carefree vehicle I have ever owned in terms of maintenance and issues. 
I have two friends with M3s and they love theirs. One did have thin paint on the rear trunk, but we put a lot of TLC and Ceramic coating, so I hope it stands the test of time. 
I know when I owned a Toyota, they were the most recalled vehicle in the US. But still called one of the most reliable, which was infuriating to me. 
Sucks you had those issues and it sounds like the Service center in your area stinks as well."
"u/Brutaka1   how  long  have  you  had  your  Model  3?    We‚Äòve  all  read  the  stories  of  poor  quality  initially  and  when  they  were  having  trouble  ramping  up, but theyve  conquered  those  demons.    Is  yours  from  those  times  of  troubles,  or  from  later,  after  they‚Äôve  stabilized  manufacturing?"
Isn't it possible to go to another service center?
"I get that.  The data seems to bare out that they slack in fit and finish detail, but the core components and assemblies are solid.  This is fine for trucks, but absolutely not fine for passenger vehicles where is more than just getting a job done.

I've been pretty fortunate with my S.  I have one interior creak that I only hear when the radio is off, and I needed to have my charge door adjusted.  I don't mind the creak as I always drove 3/4 ton trucks or larger before and they all have creaks and squeaks.

As long as the quality is there in the drivetrain and suspension, you've got a good truck."
"Have u tried tweeting elon? Or going to a different service center? Getting ur shit fucked over Everytime they service u is not acceptable at all, wow. Hope you can get it sorted man"
[deleted]
False. You have clearly never owned a Land Cruiser
"I‚Äôm not saying it was a valid argument, just sharing an anecdote."
"I LOVE my TESLA... but what he says is somewhat true... It took me 10 attempts to shut my trunk, I wasn't expecting that I had to forcefully slam it shut."
IMO even if 97% of users had 0 issues (and most likely some had issues resolved so not worth talking about) don't just assume the 3% are lying. The majority doesn't invalidate the minority.
"If you actually do research instead of just running to Tesla‚Äôs website to find a stat, you will see a countless amount of owners complaining about build quality and lack of customer service. 

You can have overall satisfaction for something, while at the same time demand necessary improvements in quality and service."
Maybe it is a consistency thing. But I have had the exact opposite experience. I have owned two Toyotas (Avalon and Camry)and one Honda (Accord) as a daily driver (Not counting my Supra and S2000 back in the day)and had the exact opposite experience. Statistically they are all highly reliable vehicles. Sounds like your vehicle is borderline lemon law if you are having all of those issues.
"You're only looking at the price tag and because it's likely more than you spent on your Toyota and Honda, you're only seeing the cons that appear on the Tesla that don't on the Toyota/Honda. I'm sure you could list dozens of things about the Model 3 that are way better than those vehicles too...Secondly I'd say that just because it has some small defects doesn't mean it's not in good-great shape. It's all about what you value. Hell I could say If I'm spending $35k on a vehicle, I should expect it to be able to update it's software for free remotely! Yet theres still really only one company that can do that. 

I just think you had the wrong expectations going into it. Whether you want to think about it this way or not, the Model 3 was/is still an early-adopter vehicle being manufactured by a company doing it's first ever mass market production...Call it grading on a curve or whatever, but with that tag come problems that other old/experienced companies have already gone through and overcome. Tesla is the first successful american auto startup since Chrysler like 95 years ago. This isn't something that is just easy to do. It takes some failures and learning/improvement. The difference is they are going through it now, whereas these other companies went through it years ago. To me it shouldn't be a surprise Tesla has struggled or had some problems other companies aren't currently experiencing.

I do get your point though, it's a lot of money, but again you need to weight the pros and cons. Are the positives worth dealing with the negatives (or just worth fixing the negatives, which again Tesla will do under warranty). If for you they aren't then the Model 3 just isn't the vehicle for you - especially not the earliest production models, and Tesla isn't the company for you until they prove more reliable with the small stuff like that. Maybe a couple years from now a Tesla will be more suitable for you if you don't think the technology is ""worth"" dealing with those hiccups."
"Jesus Christ, truck stops are going to need their own god damn nuclear power plants."
The Tesla semi is not designed for the market at the moment though. They are designed for the single driver market so they can charge and rest over 10 hours.
"Yes, I have some notes I wrote down for an EV conversion I'd like to do. I stick to open source for everything so I can actually do things like have a drift button.

The Model 3 motor is a classic permanent magnet three phase motor. Any controller capable of controlling a motor like that can control the Model 3 drive unit. I've had my eyes on the Axiom project. Here is their [Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/164932-axiom-100kw-motor-controller). They also have [a website](http://www.powerdesigns.ca/). It's based on the open source VESC motor controller, which is a wonderful motor controller for things like electric bicycles and skateboards. It's worth ordering one of those controllers to play with as they're only 60 bucks. Research VESC for more info on what the Axiom will be capable of.

&#x200B;

Model S/X drive units contain a three phase induction motor. Damien McGuire has created open source inverter control boards capable of driving the inbuilt IGBT's, along with firmware from Johannes Huebner. So you basically replace Tesla's control board with his board and it's up and running. Admittedly the firmware is less far along than VESC, but it still gets the job done. You can find info on [Damien's GitHub](https://github.com/damienmaguire). You can either buy boards from him, or use the files on the GitHub to have some manufactured for you, and you assemble them. 

&#x200B;

I'd advise you to stick to open source controllers. Closed source ones are bound to give you problems as most being sold rely on CANBUS  replication."
"No, we will actually get to market."
Bahahaha!! Nice

There are probably more."
"Estimates like that are almost certainly wrong though.  They pick some publicly available numbers and extrapolate out.  You can bet the tesla semi will be more energy efficient than previous numbers, will have better battery chemistry, and will have less overhead in the pack itself."
"Eh being the most recalled vehicle absolutely doesn‚Äôt mean the cars are unreliable.  
It means Toyota cares enough about quality they will fix production/design issues after delivery.  

SOME manufacturers refuse to recall known problems for years and years until they are forced to...I would much rather the Toyota model."
Random but what‚Äôs up with the double spacing? No disrespect just curious
Mine was built in October of 2018.
"As I've stated in another comment, there is another service center in Denver. The issue is if the service center in Littleton is causing issues to my car, then I would have to keep bringing it in to that service center for their mistakes. Otherwise sending the issues over to another service center may make them say that I caused the issues for there no proof."

I can understand if it were a truck but this is a luxury vehicle.

">Anecdotally you dont hear about people losing motors, packs or drivetrains with Teslas very often.

Maybe not with current production, but a very high percentage of early Model S cars have had a drive unit replacement. Many have had several."
Also  build date has a lot to do with it.  Early 2018 cars had more issues.  Into 2019 the reliability rate became above average.
"That number comes from Bloomberg not Tesla. And I am 100% satisfied with my model 3 and have had zero issues with it.

But then again, I am not the type that would take my car into a service center for cup holders either."
"And that's what everyone keeps on saying that is that I should use the lemon law here in Colorado. The issue is that I've already gone and submitted a report for the lemon law but they state that it's not applicable due to nothing mechanical or severe being the problem. It's all cosmetic, trim issues, panel alignments, and the service center damaging the interior of the vehicle while they fix a previous component that they damaged from the last time they damaged a prior component.

Edit: Like Right now my vehicle is in top shape and I'm glad that nothing else is damaged within the vehicle. So right now I'm trying to sell it due to getting tired of the service center not helping me out when I need it. By all means I love what Tesla's doing and for the environment but I am not happy with the service center. of my entire time owning this vehicle, this has got to be the worst experience of owning a vehicle ever."
"Fair assessment. I agree with most of it but again, spending 60K on a vehicle, I shouldn't be seeing this many problems in a brand spanken new vehicle. When I bought the 2013 Toyota Camry used, it only had one small scratch on the headliner, right A Pilar headliner not fully snapped on, two small paint touch up on the hood, and the driver door seal that wasn't fitted properly (and Toyota fixed that for free). But with it being a used 18K vehicle, I was shocked how well it's been. Though it does have two rattles when it's cold, it can handle better over bumpy roads than my Tesla can.

Again, I understand Tesla is a new company. I get it, with their master plan for a mass produced car. But there are STILL model 3's being made that are lacking poor quality. Even the Model S and Model X have poor trim and alignment issues. Brand new models too! All Tesla needs to do is slow down a bit, take a breather, hire a couple more people for quality control, and they got themselves an amazing vehicle with no quality issues whatsoever. Heck, if Toyota came in and did the quality inspection, they would be the world's leading quality EV.

And I'm looking to sell my model 3 to save up for the cybertruck. I've learned over the year and a half on how to fix rattles and open certain things in my vehicle so it's safe to say I'm ok working on the rattles in the cybertruck. I'll even dynomat it too. I mainly want the Cybeetruck due to it not having paint, strong glass and stainless steel for better resistance against hail (common in Colorado) and preventing door dings."

"Thank you, you're awesome. I've been following bimmertesla on instagram and he's got Damian's board I think? I'm leaning that way, but I just wanted to see what other tried and true options there may be out there. I'm in industrial automation, so I'm most familiar with induction motors."

"the Semi is rumored to have 1 MWh of battery storage in the biggest configuration, that alone will weight about 7 tons so even if they somehow have a giant breakthrough and find a new battery chemistry that is 50% more energy dense without having any disadvantage they are still not even breaking even with the weight of a Diesel truck.

People here just need to accept that the Semi **will** be heavier than the competition and that this will also decrease its maximum cargo.

there won't be the magic battery popping into existence that suddenly makes 1 MWh fit into a battery with less than 2 tons of weight."
Recall for electrical and transmission is not reliability?
"Agreed, in your case it's unacceptable."
"What‚Äôs the sample size? Did Bloomberg poll ALL Tesla owners? Did they ask owners that drive 12k+ miles a year? Did they ask brand new owners while they were walking out of the dealership? With out any more information on how the survey was conducted, it doesn‚Äôt mean much, to me at least. 

When your dome light literally falls out of your headliner due to the headliner being installed incorrectly, or a screw underneath the cup holder is rattling around over every bump, I think you would. The idea that Tesla owners should be ‚Äúok‚Äù with bad service and quality because it‚Äôs a Tesla is asinine. 

While you personally might not have any issues, a lot of people are having issues with seemingly trivial things that shouldn‚Äôt be issues in a brand new car from Tesla."
"It‚Äôs astonishing to me that this is a shared sentiment in the sub, and the comments of people complaining about build quality are always downvoted to oblivion. 

You can like the tech and the car, but dislike the build quality and service. Such a simple concept Redditors can‚Äôt grasp."
"The Cybertruck should be interesting as hell to see. The one reliability issue I can see immediately with the Cybertruck is the Tonneau cover. I'm not really sure how they could make the design better, because honestly it's pretty awesome and really helps with aerodynamics to have the cover go from the top of the cabin to the end of the tailgate, but I can easily see that being a real big problem especially in the cold/rain/snow. It'll be cool to see the final product.

And actually with them not needing a paint shop because it's using Stainless Steel, I really think they could start production on it quite quickly even if they manufactured it at Giga Nevada. I was listening to Sandy Munro talk about it though and he was saying it'd be best to manufacture in Fremont and move other stuff (like Seat manufcacturing) out of Fremont somewhere else because it's best to have the actual assembly together."
"At this time I'd say there aren't really any 'tried and true' methods to do an EV conversion since everything's so new. Building an EV is going to require a wide range of skills as opposed to building a normal ICE vehicle, simply because we're now required to use previously ignored technologies such as the CAN BUS and computer-controlled control mechanisms (drive motors, electric steering, battery safety and management). Best of luck on your adventures!"
"A good chunk of truck companies are making EV semis. I saw a presentation over a year ago that showed some prototypes from Volvo and another European manufacturer, though I forget which one."
Competitor and competitive are different things.
"1 MWh at 247 Wh/kg is 4049 kg.  Then you have the pack on top of that, but it will very likely be a more efficient design than smaller, older ones: no need to subdivide into modules for instance.

I do expect the end result will be heavier than traditional trucks, just not by as much as some people predict."
"Were you stranded and or did it permanently damage Something? 

In my experience the recalls were pretty minor and very unlikely to happen.

Anybody knows why is conductivity desired in motor housing? Is it to reduce losses from eddy currents?
"Very interesting.  I wonder if SpaceX will also be using this aluminum for anything?

So it is the Model Y that will be using this? Is this for future motors or the cast body tech that was written about recently?  That article gives a range for the properties of this aluminum, I hope Tesla will provide more specific details on the characteristics.

The CyberTruck will also use an alloy that was developed by that materials team.  It is a variant of 301 stainless.  I am perplexed though because it is at full hardness at cryogenic temperatures (Mars here we come!), not room temperature Earth.

"If you forget what model your die cast Tesla is, you can turn it over and it says it on the bottom."
"Damn, having a yield strength of 150MPa and a conductivity of 45%+ IACS beats even BeCu C17530 in terms of the best balance of conductivity and yield strength(130MPA at 0,2% offset and 38% IACS).

And it is considerably cheaper and lighter. :)"
Alright Hank Rearden
"Electreck should really stop posting about every single patent that Tesla files. That‚Äôs what every single big company does. For example VW filled over 6500 patents alone in 2017 (https://annualreport2017.volkswagenag.com/group-management-report/sustainable-value-enhancement/research-and-development/key-r-d-figures.html). That‚Äôs around 20 patents per day, and it honestly says nothing about the progress, as companies need to file patents as a defense against patent war."
"Random question for anyone who might know a thing or two, how possible or impossible is it for Tesla to start making planes w/ battery instead of fuel?"
Knew this was coming. So excited. V2 of the Cybertruck will be boss~!!!!
Very interested in what this could mean for my company. We currently extrude a great deal of parts for Tesla. Hopefully this doesn't hurt us at all.
"I worked in an aluminum research lab at a university. I recall a discussion between one of the researchers and the head proff looking over some matrix of cast alloys. Addition of >0.6% copper into the alloy with certain silica to prevent cracking in cast alloys was the research. 

Researcher: This is amazing! This cast alloy will make engine blocks 20% stronger!

Proff: Yeah, they will, in 40 years, maybe. We have the alloy, but it will take time to figure out if the alloy will work as well with fatigue, shock, corrosion, and vibration the same way and better compared to what is on the market. See how well it will cast too. Need a few cast engines and test that for a few years, then see if some company will retool the casting to follow our research, then maybe, maybe, the alloy will be on the market. They won't share the alloy information for years, so after the patent or control is done, maybe this casting alloy will be everywhere."

"I HATE fucking rust...

I dont fuck rust I just hate it"
What is the application of this? Cutting cost by being able to use the same alloy for parts with different requirements?
It‚Äôs really good to see Tesla expanding the envelope in concern to metals and manufacturing strategies.
So my question is how repairable is it. Can you weld it? If not this is a failure
Transparent aluminum?

"Metallurgy is super interesting. I don‚Äôt know enough about that area of physical science to even ask an intelligent question, but I find it all very fascinating. :)"
"I‚Äôll try with a question: when I did my degree I wrote a paper on the potential of amorphous alloys - namely LiquidMetal, a titanium alloy that was used in a lot of sporting good due to its energy return properties. 
It was also very good for casting, is it in wide use today? If not I wonder why it seemed to have so much potential."
i was just gona throw my comment into the mix but instead i am going to direct this at you. i do not recall ever seeing news of a legacy car maker pushing the envelope with material improvments. is that true or is it no one cares if GM makes a new iron alloy? i do remember when toyota made their carbon fiber loom and everyone though we were gona have a cf corolla soon.

Possibly heat conductivity for cooling?
"It's desireable if you are not using copper for your rotor bars but fully cast aluminum conductor cages (cheaper/lighter/eassier to fabricate) .

it's already very common for smaller/cheaper motors and i think this is part of tesla staying ahead of everyone in the resource game... same as they are doing with in-house battery production.

think of the increase in copper demand if every carmaker goes fully electric... now imagine you can make your motors as efficient as the competition but at half the cost because you dont need expensive copper."
Easier to ground?
Easier to disable when its resold.
">  I am perplexed though because it is at full hardness at cryogenic temperatures (Mars here we come!), not room temperature Earth. 

I think you've misunderstood. He's comparing the two materials at a specific temperature point (cryo). At room temp, the properties will be different by a differing margin for each material."
Just because it's stronger at cryo doesn't mean it's useless at room temp.
"Most materials get increased strength at cryo temperatures. You see significantly different decreases e in ductility accompanied with it, though. FCC metals like aluminum or austinic steels retain their ductility while ferritic or martensitic steels get brittle."
"Mine just says ""Killroy was here"""
Yes! I know some of those words.
"I agree that it's nothing special, but lots of tesla enthusiasts love seeing this kind of stuff. I'm sure enthusiasts of other things would be glad to have people report on all the mundane stuff they do just because they like talking about it even if it never gets implemented. But I agree that a lot of people take it to mean that tesla is leaps and bounds ahead in areas where it's par for the course to other players but simply not reported on."
"Sort of possible?  The electric motors are easy, they can be incredibly powerful for their size/weight.  Batteries are the problem.  Aircraft are extremely weight sensitive, so battery energy densities are a problem.  Top end batteries can do about 170watt-hours per kg.  Jet fuel is about 12000 watt-hours per kg.  So you‚Äôd need huge amounts of batteries to get the same amount of power out of your plane.  That being said, there are some cases where electric can work, that being very short hops where you can use the weight you saved in fuel on batteries (within the limits of the aircraft). You run into charging issues, just like you would on a long road trip in a tesla.  Planes also only make money while they‚Äôre flying.  A plane sitting on the ground, especially an airliner or bizjet is just bleeding money.  Telling a company its going to take 8hrs to recharge their plane is a complete non-starter.  Assuming you get the technology figured out to be able to deliver that amount of power, that quickly."
Elon Musk have said a couple of times that he has a design for one ready but that they need to hit 400 Wh/kg on the batteries(about 250 Wh/kg at the moment) so not impossible.
It's possible just wouldn't hold much cargo or go fast.
"Well, the main problem is current top end lithium-ion cells from Tesla have energy densities of 275Wh/kg.

Compared to kerosene, that's less than 5% of its gravimetric energy density(10 000Wh/kg).

Of course, when Tesla releases its lithium-ion tech with Maxwell's DBE, energy density would be boosted to 330Wh/kg right off the bat, which is great, with even higher energy densities later on being possible(500-600Wh/kg+)."
"Elon touches on this in the recent third row podcast interview he did. If you haven‚Äôt seen it, I would highly recommend giving it a watch."
"Not possible at all for anything bigger than a Cessna Skyhawk.

Practical engineering or engineering explained has a video on it.


But it boils down to a max seat, fully loaded, modern 747 getting 100mpg per passenger (500 passengers and an actual fuel usage of 5 gallons (US) per mile). Meaning it is already really efficient. And batteries are way less energy dense than jet fuel."
This guy metals. /s
"If you can't weld metal, the metal is not the failure."
"They literally have R&D teams that do the same thing and have been doing so forever. It's just so how every time Tesla does something normal, it's a big deal here. This shouldn't be news. Patents are added almost every day."
Any static charge or anything that built up on the body would interfere with the signals. Cars already use the body as a common earthing point though.

"You didn‚Äôt read the article, did you? These alloys were invented for their conductivity in the context of electric motors. They have nothing to do with suspension components."
"Probably a false argument in this case. Alloy development happens all the time, but materials science is very much a moving target - leading edge work is happening now due to computing improvements. It could very well be that this development required modern computing. In which case, your assumption fails."
You're definitely right. All of the best inventions have come from societies that suppress capitalism. /s

"I worked in a fabrication shop in the 90s. We didn't deal with casting, but forming sheet metal. Aluminum was the easiest to work with, steel was reasonable, and stainless was a hassle and a half due to its hardness. We wouldn't even touch titanium because it was so much more expensive and difficult to work with. 

I would assume titanium is limited in practical applications due to the significantly higher cost of raw material *and* fabrication. It does perform better, but not better enough to outweigh the cost to add benefits that aren't really needed."
"I will be honest I don‚Äôt work much in that arena. My specialization was in steel and aluminum alloys, corrosion and heat treatments. Metallurgy is a huge field and is ever changing now with additive manufacturing (powder met) and other crazy techniques. I would love to see someone else who is more verse in amorphous Ti alloys to chime in!"
"I did my PhD in the lab that developed the original liquidmetal alloy. The company, Liquidmetal, is still around, but due to some poor business decisions and mismanagement it hasn't caught on commercially yet. There were a few successful parts (flip phone hinge, SIM ejector spring in an iPhone variant), but, in general, they had too many part failures to make money.

I did my work on making custom amorphous metal alloys for gears for cryogenic actuators. Been working on it for over a decade, and, fingers crossed, they'll be running on some lunar landers in a few years.

Edit: Also, my take on the article is it's more advertising than science. Apple publishes a lot of the same junk on their custom materials."
"I remember reading about it. At the time one version had problems for cracking so missed the boat for automotive suspension components, Apple supposedly brought the rights to use it for consumer manufacturing but is believed to have only used it for one version of a sim removal tool. Suggestion was that it‚Äôs high rate of energy return could cause damage to electronics if dropped. I‚Äôm sure we have not heard the last of it. Maybe when Apple no longer has the rights then consumer electronic items might be made of it. Seems they may have brought it simply to stop others using it or to keep up their sleeve Incase they need an advantage some time in the future. Maybe it‚Äôs not economical to use at this point.


Licensed uses[edit]
Apple Inc., acquired a perpetual, exclusive license to use its technology in consumer electronics.[17]
The Swatch Group, was granted an exclusive license to utilize Liquidmetal in its timepieces."
"I have a flash drive and mp3 player from San disc that used that alloy for the casing.  The flash drive is fricking indestrucrible, but it's only 1GB, so I don't use it that much anymore."
"Ford Patented a Process that allows one to do away with cast iron sleeves in aluminum engine blocks by means of Plasma Transferred Wire Arc transfer.  The process deposits an extremely thin, but very durable and hard iron coating that serves as the final honed product that the piston rings interface with to seal the piston to cylinder wall interface and keep oil out of the combustion chamber.  The coating is only 150 microns thick, is MUCH lighter than a pressed in cast iron liner, and allows for larger cylinder bore among the primary benefits.  


Ford used this on the 5.8L GT500 engine in the 2013-2014  model years as well as subsequent Modular motors, and the Ecoboost Line of I4 anad V6 engines.  Nissan also licensed the technology to use in the GTR."
"I think things Tesla do get more attention as a whole because the Tesla fan base is far more attentive and interested.

Many manufacturers have experimented with different materials and different build philosophies and still do but you won‚Äôt find much about them because there‚Äôs little interest

I work for a manufacturer (not a metallurgist so my knowledge is limited m) and we and various other automakers are always trying new things"
"Check the Munro tear down of the i3. All sorts of cool material science and assembly innovations. It‚Äôs too bad BMW let the engineering team go to China, but the IP I‚Äôm sure they retained."
"Not too many years ago, Ford made a splash with a mostly- or all-aluminum F150 body due to newly developed welding techniques."
Lots of materials advancements at traditional companies. They just don't think of themselves as tech companies and keep most of the work quiet. They don't realize new friction welding techniques or advanced hydroforming methods can help change public opinion about their brand.
"I said metallurgist, not alchemist."
They talk about electrical conductivity
"That makes sense, but Tesla uses permanent magnet synchronous motors in their newer models. They only have a small cage for a defined reluctance."
"And it makes Tesla even more sustainable, since copper is already becoming rare."
"I didn't mean to suggest that. what I wanted to suggest is that another formulation could be better in the temperature range and environment the car will exist in on Earth.

I can understand Elon's excitement over this alloy.  Build everything!  I would probably want some 301 stainless lunchboxes for my kids."
Can you explain this joke to me? I only know killroy from the song Mr roboto by Styx.
"When you see %IACS, it means the percentage of conductivity vs copper.

Yield strength is the strength right before it'll start deforming plastically.

Edit: Bad brain. Plastically, not elastically."
"Weight issues aside, at that level doing battery swaps would probably be the way to go."
Thanks for the explanation! I figured they can probably get around the charging issue by having additional battery packs as swappable units at certain locations. How about solar? Would panels with enough coating be able to get any decent recharge from good weather conditions? Or solar efficiency that bad still?
">  Top end batteries can do about 170watt-hours per kg. Jet fuel is about 12000 watt-hours per kg.

Tesla seem to be at about 170 Wh/kg at pack level today for the Model 3. It's probably possible to do better at bigger scales because some of the stuff in the pack is going to behave like a fixed cost.

12 kWh/kg is roughly the LHV of jet fuel, but this isn't a fair basis for comparison with batteries because electrical machines can convert the energy into mechanical power rather more efficiently than heat engines. 

[The brake thermal efficiency of aero-derivative GTs is about 40%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brake-specific_fuel_consumption), whereas you should be able to get about 80-90% of the electrical energy in a battery out as mechanical work.

As such, it's probably fairer to think of jet fuel as being about 5 kWh/kg, and batteries about 0.2 kWh/kg, with reasonable scope to grow to perhaps 0.3-0.5 kWh/kg. 

> So you‚Äôd need huge amounts of batteries to get the same amount of power out of your plane.

The problem is not power. It's specific energy. 

>  That being said, there are some cases where electric can work, that being very short hops where you can use the weight you saved in fuel on batteries (within the limits of the aircraft). 

This sounds like a retrofit argument. Retrofit is extremely marginal.  


> Planes also only make money while they‚Äôre flying. A plane sitting on the ground, especially an airliner 

Turnaround isn't so much of a problem because you can probably charge at 1 C without too much trouble. You aren't going to be starting from empty because of the reserve requirements, which can easily exceed the block energy on short blocks. 

The problem is that the battery mass fraction becomes large & the payload fraction becomes small, so you end up with a really big aeroplane for a given payload-range it's challenging to offer a decent ROI to the customer. Battery life can also be a concern. 

> or bizjet is just bleeding money

Bizjets outside of the fractionals are hangar queens. The value to the customer is in having the *option* to fly at very short notice. As such, the bizjet is less sensitive to turnaround than an airliner, but it's more sensitive to availability because you have to be *really* rich to afford a spare. 

Fractionals generally make more sense for most people because they make better use of the capital asset in exchange for a negligible reduction in bragging rights."

Thanks for making it glaringly obvious that you don't know anything about welding... Especially anything cast. But you are too quick to defend anything Tesla than understand others questions. You are nothing like Elon.
"They obviously have R&D teams - but are they innovating *like this* - i.e. in a similar way, which is the important question.

"Yes, engine, exhaust, and other components are currently cast today .  The important part of this article is this piece

>	Commercial cast aluminum alloys fall into one of two categories ‚Äî either possessing high-yield strength or possessing high conductivity. For example, the A356 aluminum alloy has a yield strength of greater than 175 MPa, but has a conductivity of approximately 40% IACS. Conversely, the 100.1 aluminum alloy has a conductivity of greater than 48% IACS, but a yield strength of less than 50MPa. For certain applications, for example, parts within an electric vehicle like a rotor or an inverter, both high strength and conductivity are desired. Further, because it is desired to form these electric-vehicle parts through a casting process, wrought alloys cannot be used. Rather, it is desirable to form the parts through a casting process, such that the parts may be cast quickly and reliably, such as through a low pressure and high velocity metal injection or a high pressure die casting process. After casting, suitable alloys must maintain their properties sufficiently for the necessary application. Poor castability of the alloy often results in observed hot tearing, and can cause fill issues which typically decreases the mechanical and electrical properties of the end cast part.

They‚Äôre basically saying that the traditional alloys had significant pros and cons, so you couldn‚Äôt use a single alloy for all of your different applications.  With this new alloy they can achieve the pros of both traditional alloys, but in addition, they can also use casting techniques which I don‚Äôt think previously we could do with aluminum alloys.  (someone check me on this)

>In comparison with the numbers listed above, Tesla claims that its new aluminum alloys can be tweaked to achieve yield strength of 90 MPa to 150 MPa and electrical conductivity of 40% IACS up to 60% IACS.
>They also claim that the new alloys can support die casting:
In one embodiment, the alloy has the proper fluidity to ensure that the alloy wets the entire length of a mold and the mold is properly formed, and such that the alloy resists hot-tearing and retains the desired yield strength when the cast solidifies.


Edit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger! Cheers üçª"
"they do, but it normally comes with a big trade off in conductivity. that doesn't really matter if you are making a structural part like an engine blocks in traditional auto but it is crucial for the efficiency of a rotor in an electric motor.

huge currents ( I ) inevitably go through the Rotors and if they have any resistance ( R ), the power losses (=heat) will be R\*I\*I, you can't really avoid high currents if you want a strong motor, but if you can get the resistance down low enough, it becomes manageable.

so basically this means tesla can now make the same motors cheaper by casting  or atleast make them more efficient(=more range) in case they were already casting them..."
"A lot do but they all have their own ""secret sauce"" and no one wants to tell anyone else"
Making molds out of molten metal like you would a cake batter in a pan. Compared to stamping the part from a flat sheet of metal which is bent and formed over multiple steps.
"Die casting is basically just injection molding for metal. 

You take two (sometimes more) mold halves (the dies) and push them together... squirt molten metal into it, wait for it to cool, and then pull the dies back apart and eject the now solid metal part."
Die casting is pouring metal into a mold as opposed to machining where it's cut from a block of metal. With casting you can have more control over the composition of metal and material properties

"Not in an Earth atmosphere, but it can significantly weaken them!"
"Well, now that you're asking."
"Yes.

Source: I was a lvl 90 Blacksmith in FFXI."
Stainless steel weighs twice as much so if you have 3000lbs you can get 1500lbswith titanium alloy. This translates into faster acceleration using less power and much better range. Potentially you can build an electric car with 500 mile range that weighs the same as a gas car.
"It must be a cost thing, one of the properties is how well it casts. If you‚Äôve bought an iPhone in the last 10 years you probably have some at home, I‚Äôm pretty sure the sim ejector is made from it if it‚Äôs the shiny sharp edge one. The paperclip looking one isn‚Äôt."
"And this is what I love about reddit! That is amazing. I had a pair of Head skis back in 2006 which aparently used Liquidmetal as one of the layers in the laminate. They were awesome, I felt like they actually did have better than average energy return.

"Copper is far from rare, we won't run out of the copper on earth for a million years at current consumption levels. Its just not expensive enough to be profitable mining copper at smaller yields yet.

So Tesla isn't getting more sustainable, it just might be more affordable in the future if copper does get more expensive than this alloy costs to make (which, honestly, I doubt will happen)."
"Every cubic centimeter of earth's continental crust contains 0.183mg of copper. Earth's crust is a rough average of 2.17*10^22 kg, meaning copper is around 1.47 * 10^18 kg. Roughly 1.47 quintillion kilograms.

B.) It's too costly, difficult to manufacture, or qualitative of some other overruling factor."

"Thanks for the explanation!

I didn‚Äôt mean anything bad with my previous comment, just some banter!

This battery technology is not my forte (although very interesting), I just try to understend whenever there is some breakthrough, which is already hard enough to deduce from all these Electrek reports.."
"Totally.  But thats another level of infrastructure and spending.  Now you need extra batteries at all the places you land.  Different sized batteries, different form factors for different planes, guys who can swap them, machines that can lift them.  Facilities to charge and store them.  The risk of someone installing it incorrectly in the dark and blowing snow, having latching mechanisms to hold that much weight securely, while also being easy to swap.   On a small private recreational plane, maaaybe.  On your airliner, not a chance.  With jet fuel its one fuel for everyone, one truck, one guy.  Fill it and close the cap."
"OK on paper, but the FMEA is unlikely to be encouraging."
"Solar is still way too inefficient.  And the number one priority on your plane is going to be reliability.  Swappable units come with a logistics penalty.  How much is that battery gonna weigh? Where is it going to go?  Fuel is stored primarily in the wings, which are huge nearly empty spaces so its a good place to put it.  A big huge battery pack with enough grunt to move an airliner, and removeable, will have to go in the fuselage, taking up precious revenue space.  There are solar powered experimental things out there, but theyre very very verrrry light weight, and are more just to prove that solar is a theoretical option.  The other problem is what do you do during an overnight flight? Prolonged cloud cover?  Youre gonna need batteries anyway.  Keep in mind, a 737-800, by no means the largest airliner just very common, weighs in at around 170 000lbs at max take off weight.  A tesla model s is at 4400ish.  That plane is also going to cruise at 530ish miles an hour (not knots or mach, plane nerds, I converted). So you‚Äôre moving nearly 40 times the weight 7 times as fast.  Think of what Tesla would have to do keep their car the same size, and just go 7 times the speed (and do it for 6 hours straight)."
"It's not that solar efficiency is low.  Solar efficiency is pretty good, but we've gotten used to having so much power available, and created inefficient and power hungry requirements that solar alone isn't enough, at least not without grid connection or sizeable batteries."
"Solar is never going to supply enough power for an airliner because power requirement is proportional to speed & wing area is inversely proportional to speed^2 . 

Imagine you have something like an [A320](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A320_family) flying at 230 m/s @ L/D = 15 and a weight of about 80 tonnes.

Drag is 53 kN, so thrust power requirement is 12.3 MW (16,500 hp in old money).

The A320 has a wing area of 124 m^2 ; you'll struggle to find anywhere on earth which sees even 1 kW/m^2 of [insolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance) during the day.

As a result, if the propulsion system and the panels were both 100% efficient, and the panels weighed nothing, they would be good for about ***1%*** of the cruise power requirement.

If you want solar then you need to accept a much lower cruise speed, and a much larger wing area, which is why [Solar Impulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Impulse) needed almost the same span as an A380 to carry one person at about 10% of the speed of an airliner."
Check Google Patents. They all file thousands every year. Every single automotive and heavy duty company has their own metallurgical lab developing custom alloys. Naive to think they don't.

Just because you don't pay any attention to anything else beside Tesla doesn't mean it doesn't exist."
"Is that worth watching?  It's on Apple TV and I don't know if I want to get sucked in.

Do I dare to boldly go?"
"I mean... we can read the article for you and post it here. To answer your question:

> In one embodiment, the alloy has the proper fluidity to ensure that the alloy wets the entire length of a mold and the mold is properly formed, and such that the alloy resists hot-tearing and retains the desired yield strength when the cast solidifies."
"You're right in the sense that the activity within an all-encompassing economic paradigm can't be separated from that paradigm. If capitalism is the way things get done, then that is the way they are done.

Sadly, this also means that if the incentives of capitalism don't align with external objectives (like research that doesn't have an immediate capitalistic benefit), then it almost always won't be achieved by capitalist processes and incentives.

There are of course alternative processes and incentives, such as publicly funded research, which often generates some of the most significant technologies, such as the internet, wi-fi, a lot of space tech, etc. etc. but given that they still exist within an overall capitalist environment, they are eventually subsumed into the capitalist processes, and the benefits and profits get privatised, even though the original costs were socialised. In theory, those profits would be taxed at a level which repaid the cost of the initial public investment, but in our current 'late stage' capitalism, that happens less and less frequently or successfully."
"Are you talking about induction rotors? Permenant magnet rotors should not have any currents. 

Casting is terrible for rotors for a lot of other reasons. It‚Äôs low strength, inherently unbalanced due to voids, and rotors are mostly cylindrical and needs machined surfaces anyways. It‚Äôs much better to just turn down 6061 round bar to start with"
I think you meant I * R * R
Or cut down from a block in a CNC machine or a lathe.
Ohhh. I guess I had the idea that it was always done this way. Hahaha. I am so clueless to the whole process. Glad it has a breakthrough to make it easier for them. Sounds like it would have less steps and also less point of failures. Right? Because one solid mat is better than something bent to form the same thing? Reaching beyond my scope of knowledge so correct me where I sidestepped.
How does the die not become a part of the casting itself? Am I making sense? I never understood how that works and how it isn't just one big block in the end. Different materials that have higher/lower melting points? That's my guess at least.
"This is all a dream, you need to wake up."

"I appreciate your expert opinion, thank you for weighing in on the matter."
"Certainly, but at what cost?"
"The stuff does have some really cool properties. It was always a bit of a debate if the skis/tennis rackets actually were improved by the inclusion of some thing foils of metallic glass. I know the skis, tennis and racquetball rackets were all popular and got high reviews, but I'm still not sure if they were just well made pieces of sports equipment with some really good advertising behind them.

The golf clubs were supposed to be a joy to hit, though. They ran into issues with the driver exploding after ~500 hits due to the fracture toughness being too low. At the time they didn't understand too much oxygen in the alloy made the fracture toughness too low for the thickness of the driver's face. When the club exploded it made flaming, self-sharpening shrapnel go flying down the course. Our group has also done our fair share of work for the DoD...

You have actually come into contact with metallic glass before, though. If you think of those puffy anti-theft strips that come on CDs/DVDs and have a thin piece of metallic foil in them (not the squiggly RFID ones), that's metallic glass. Next time you see one, cut the plastic open and play with the foil. It's razor sharp and crazy tough. Slice your fingers right up."
Guess my attempt at sarcasm didn‚Äôt shine through either lol
Huh. TIL.
"But if the property they were interested in were heat conductivity, why would they discuss electrical conductivity at all (even though they're related)? Doesn't make sense.

It'd be like saying glass is brittle and shatters easily to discuss how strong it is. Hardness and strength are typically correlated... but you wouldn't use one to necessarily describe the other."
"Another thing about weight is that most planes wont top off for shorter flights. A 737 that can fly nonstop Boston to Los Angeles wouldnt need to carry more than a 1/3 of a tank for a flight Boston to DC. It costs fuel to carry fuel.

Batteries have the same weight all the time."
"Patents for what though? Fluffier seat fabric? More expensive sounding door chime?

Or actual high tech manufacturing techniques?"

But what if they could make everything you just said suddenly untrue? It looks like they're developing die casting and in the article it talks about their efforts to overcome these issues.
"No, it P = R * I¬≤"
"Or lost wax casting, which is usually not very strong"
"The mold is steel or some other high melting point metal. The casting metal has a lower point. 


An easy example is youtube people casting lead bullets. Use steel molds with high melting points and lead with a very low melting point, relatively speaking."
"Yes, different metals. Typically you want to use metals with different melting points and metals that aren't capable of welding to each other. Steel and aluminum is a good example."

"If they can manufacture using the alloy cheaply they might break even. Remember they are saving on assembly, manufacturing, battery capacity and to achieve same wh/m as heavier car. It might actually be cheaper in the end and the car is stronger."
"That‚Äôs really interesting about the failure mode. The end of that pair of skis for me came in Japan when I landed flat on my back from quite a height (really poor vis and face shots, couldn‚Äôt see a traverse trail and got launched). The tail of the ski definitely failed and bent in a really unusual way. 

You say it was a foil of it, my assumption was that the 1mm thick metal layer visible in the sandwich of the side wall was the liquid metal? This seemed like a significant enough amount to have a good effect, though if it were a thinner foil applied to that, I  agree it may not have. 

They were really easy to pop off the snow coming out of turns, which was the reason I started looking into the science of it."
"oops, haha."
"It matters because the chassis of the car and its components are used as a path back to the negative terminal (ground). By having a housing on a component which is conductive enough to also be a ground means cheaper (and usually simpler) construction.


It can also be used for components like rotors or inverters."
Also most planes are unable to land when fully fueled so you will never be able to replace the entire possible fuel weight with batteries so this is only viable for short range flights with low weight
"The patents are in the link that I had in the previous post. The patents cross everything from material science to mechanical and electrical systems. Tesla isn't unique. Every company innovates. GM is a bigger innovator than Tesla along with plenty of other manufacturers. It just that every time Tesla files a patent, this sub explodes like they are the only ones advancing the industry which is completely false. A lot of the images about Tesla on this sub is just myths."
"Yeah first two episodes should have been one imo, not a ton happens."
"Sorry, bud. I can only explain things to you. Can't understand it for you."
"Little slow today, huh?"
"You absolutely can not have a cast surface as your final surface in a rotor in motors that are the precision level of these. You cast an oversized part and machine the surface to extremely tight tolerances.

As for balancing cast material, having castings without voids isn't that uncommon, but that's not the only reason for unbalanced parts."
Hey! I was right! Thanks for taking your time to explain this to me. I'm at work which doesn't block reddit but does other sites like youtube so can't look a lot of stuff up right now. Appreciate ya!
"You cannot. 

There is so much iron on earth that you can find it in river clay in somewhat usable quantities. Titanium not so much, so you have a much much higher cost just to get raw material.

And then you get manufacturing. Titanium is such a pain in the ass to work with it's not even funny. Saving money on manufacturing by switching to titanium is like saving money on your heating bill by moving to Antarctica. Counterproductive. 

The things that make titanium great (high heat tolerance, very high strength) are exactly the same things that make it such a pain to work with. The problem is intrinsic."
I reeeally dont know much about anything. But titanium is stupid expensive.
"I've never actually see the skis, though I doubt they had a 1mm layer inside. Making a large 1mm sheet of metallic glass has been a sort of holy grail for the field since they were discovered. Think about most sheet metal and plastic pieces you come into contact with in your day to day life, and there's not much thicker than 1mm. You can make foils about 0.2mm thick fairly easily by melt spinning. You can make small parts with 1mm wall thicknesses by injection molding, but depth is pretty limited. You can make 1/4"" thick sheets by die casting. But that middle range has been elusive for a long time."
Never speak in absolutes
"Appreciate your employer‚Äôs IT team, who also wants to browse reddit!"
Not even if it is an alloy specifically engineered for die casting?
"You better have flood coolant. Like, the other guys in the shop are going to start building life rafts quantities of coolant. lol

I grew up down the street from a kid whose dad worked in a shop that machined titanium parts for, uh, US government purposes. Just the chips he brought home were like alien technology light weight. But the number of tools he brought home that had been totally cooked was incredible."
"What would you even make the mold out of? Tungsten? Ceramics? Titanium has one of the highest melting points of any metal, so you'd need something with a much much higher temperature tolerance to be an effective mold for die casting.

I'm not saying you could never make a titanium die cast part (I'm sure you could tbh), I'm saying it will definitely not be at a mass production friendly cost because titanium makes the cost of everything else around it go up too. That's why it sucks to work with. You need all new expensive tools that wear out fast, you need everything to be temperature resistant, you need everything made out of unconventional materials, it just kind of sucks.

As you may be able to tell I've been traumatized by titanium. In my nightmares I still hear ""6Al4V"" whispered by the faceless shadows."
Symmetrical Titanium nano crystal lattice powder. When air is removed and small amount of energy is applied along the intended fuse matrix the particles form a chemical bond fusing into solid stricture. Not a metallurgist but theoretically this is possible.
Is that basically ‚Äúcold-weld titanium dust together‚Äù?
"Yea that's exactly what it is. 

Challenges include preparing the titanium dust in an anaerobic environment to avoid forming an oxide layer on the dust particles (which happens really fast in air) and getting full part density instead of having the whole thing filled with microscopic voids.

U know what all that sounds like to me? $$$$. It's doable, but aluminum is fine for a room temperature application. You can cast aluminum easily using cheap equipment, and aluminum is very very very cheap and plentiful globally compared to titanium.

Also of interest: good luck fixing a broken titanium part. A moderately skilled mechanic or technician can weld aluminum and take a minor L on strength of the finished part. Good luck welding a broken titanium frame piece without some *really* specialized labor."
Also wouldn‚Äôt the titanium dust post weld be very brittle? At that point it would be more like a lattice structure than a solid piece of metal.
"Titanium in general has problems with cracking during welding. The dust would likely be a bit worse but I don't want to overstate my experience with this topic. A lot of it comes down to properly shielding the weld from air and using correct filler material.

Lattice structure is generous. Think ""very dense sponge"" for what fused powder becomes as a bulk material. It doesn't really become a true lattice except at the smallest of scales (molecular). At larger scales, places where the powder isn't fully compacted or has a slight impurity would create hollow areas inside the part on the scale of fractions of a millimeter. These would be distributed throughout the part, so maybe the finished piece would only be 95% dense, 5% empty void. Not catastrophic but annoying and starts to degrade the structural properties."
"Right so at that point what‚Äôs the advantage of titanium over aluminum? Like I can see using this ‚Äúcold-sintering‚Äù process for making things like a high volume satellite chassis where weight *really* matters, but in auto manufacturing solid aluminum and steel are way better choices."
"Titanium is better when money is no object, or the price of ""weight"" vastly exceeds the price of ""fabrication"".

Examples where this is true are things like artificial knees or hips where people are willing to pay huge amounts of money to have something that is just as light as the original joint and they want it to last forever.

Another example is in satellites or spacecraft where launches are priced by weight and each kilogram could cost almost $10,000. So if you save 10kg by switching to titanium but the titanium part costs $20k more, you've come out ahead.

Another place titanium is great is when you need something physically small to take a lot of force. Aluminum is not only heavier than titanium for the same strength, it takes up much more volume. So if you have a tiny pin or fastener that needs to support thousands of pounds, titanium is a great material to use.

Yet another example is when you need high heat tolerance. Titanium is way better than steel or aluminum at high temperature, so if you have a part that needs to be strong both at room temperature and at 1000¬∞ C, titanium makes sense."
"The 10,000$ knew joint is not because titanium is expensive. It is because healthcare costs are astronomical. Titanium costs $17/kg and if you make something like liquid metal alloy from Ti you can mold it cheaply and it will cost even less. 1ton will be $17,000 but if you get it in quantities it will be much much cheaper. Even at $17k vs $8k cost for steel think of what you are getting!"
"Bulk material prices are an extremely poor predictor of finished component cost. There's a positive correlation but that's about it.

For instance, buying a 1 foot length of 1"" diameter titanium tube costs about $60. That translates to a cost of $630/kg! And that's for a mass produced standardized item. 

By contrast, the same tube made from mild steel is $11. 

So an identical part costs 5.5x more despite the raw material only costing 2x the amount!

This issue only gets worse as part completely increases. I have gotten quotes for $12,000 for a 2kg press formed titanium part. The same part made from steel or aluminum would cost less than $500.

Please do not use bulk commodity prices to estimate costs. You will always be sorely disappointed."
The smaller prices you buy the higher per kg cost. If you get a 20 ton roll you will be paying much less. In this case you will buy titanium oxide and process it which will be much less than pure titanium.
"*""And the Tesla cameras are of superior quality than what they would otherwise get.‚Äù*

Can confirm. When my car was hit-n-run in a parking lot, I showed the Sentry footage to the local police as part of the police report I filed. After watching the footage, the officer literally told me that the footage is better than his squad car produces."
Just the fact that they wont be burning all that fuel while the car is idling (which is like 90% of the time) is a huge win for pretty much everyone.
"EV's like the Model S and Model 3 make for excellent squad cars.  

These cars are parked most of the time anyways - during highway speed monitoring, at the scenes of crimes and accidents, stakeouts etc.  

Having to keep the motor running makes no sense.  

I¬¥d love to see statistics on how many miles a patrol car actually drives during an average shift.  ""Not many"" is my guess.

Tesla should offer a ""LEO"" version of their operating system, so the data functionalities that the police needs like looking up plate numbers or accessing criminal databases can be done straight from the main touchscreen and not need a seperate laptop."
"I'm a criminal defense lawyer so I regularly get to watch cruiser dash cams as well as body cams. Dashcams are basically useless. Poor resolution, audio cuts out often, and the video quality is horrible. It seems to handle flashing lights particularly badly and gets blinded by passing lights (ie. takes a long time too recover). Body cams on the other hand are much more crisp, actually points at things I want to watch (police-suspect interaction), has audio I can actually understand. Makes sense because dashcams have been on the cruisers for a relatively long time (old tech) and they take a pounding from just the regular driving whereas the body cams are all pretty much new. I've seen a few Tesla cam footage and they're much superior to any dashcams I've watched by order of several magnitude. They're actually better than the best body cam footage also because the cameras are mounted on a stable base and not someone who shifts and moves about."
"Just in case you have Electrek blocked (I don't know who was first): [teslarati](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-police-cruiser-sentry-mode-official-use/) and [thedriven](https://thedriven.io/2020/02/07/model-3-police-car-to-use-sentry-mode-in-official-capacity/).

I thought it saved the department from repair costs because of vandalism but basically saved $3k on camera installation. 

Except for the rear camera I don't consider the Tesla cams 'great' quality but with this quote I wonder how bad the police cameras really are 

> ""The forum member reports that the Tesla cameras built into the cars are also of superior quality than what the department would usually utilise.""

Also thought it was interesting they wired the added electronics to the 400v battery and didn't need to install a second 12v:

> ""The installation of these modifications required the lights to be wired to the vehicle‚Äôs main 75 kWh battery.""

- teslarati

though they may be saying that just using the 12v and relying on the DC->DC is basically running everything off the 400v line. NOTE: I am not saying their electronics are 400v just that they would have used their own 400v->12v/24v to power the added stuff."
"I think they should give the police the FSD also so that whey when they are typing up their emails while driving the car can do the driving and not kill someone like this guy.

Not surprised it's Westport.
"Electric police cruisers make so much sense. Great acceleration, low power consumption while parked, great battery power for all onboard electronics. Add on the benefits of an autonomous cars and the sensors that come prebuilt into them and it's a no brainer assuming the manufacturer works to make that data available to the officers."
"the Cybertruck is going to be an awesome law enforcement vehicle. bulletproof to 9mm rounds? cops will love that. the only question might be the cost of repairing the stainless body after pit-maneuvering someone. 

things that will probably not happen but would be hilarious: 

pinned down? why not just summon your truck? 

request Tesla to make an ""emergency extraction"" mode where it just drives as quickly as it can to your location, over any terrain it can pass. military would love that also. 

tesla could make a deployable patrol drone out of the back of the truck"
"Idk. The dash cam in my patrol car is alot nicer than sentry mode. HD cameras front, back, and on the rear seat. Wireless mic that has a pretty good range. Automaticly flags any event my lights were on. Radar speed is imprinted on the video along with the status of my lights and siren. 

Idk if i would give that up and rely on the tesla cameras. 

Also knowing how hard police cars are handled. Big guys, vests, duty belts, boots. Custodies pissing, shitting, vomiting, and bleeding everywhere? Its going to destroy that interior. 

I would love one for sneaky night time or stealthy patrol. But real day to day shit? Gunna destroy it. 

Might work as a detective or SRO car."
I live in CT and cant believe theyre actually being economical
That‚Äôs too bad.
I hope it can record UFO footage too
Average cost of a police vehicle appears to be around 35-40K so it's a little weird to say they're saving 3K on like one option. The fuel savings is great though. I just wonder how it works with them taking it home. I assume they'd have to charge it overnight at the precinct? And how do they have the capacity to charge many cars at once?
I was thinking if police would use Tesla cars and this answers my question and makes my day

Very nice.  I will have to check with the local department to see if they added cameras.
Easier to outrun though
"My hometown, wooooo!!"

woah
"government contracts will be big money, smart move"
General reminder that Westport is known to be filthy rich and the cost of this project is pretty much a rounding error in the budget. It will take a while for police Teslas to be widespread.
This site sells plug and play USB drives to record the sentry cameras. Highly recommend to have if you don‚Äôt already: http://www.teslasentrycam.com
"Ew. The last thing I wanna see is police livery on a Tesla. That poor, poor car."
"Question, don't squad cars produce footage with audio? Wouldn't they need audio? Tesla cams don't have audio though"
Is this video encrypted and undeletable? Otherwise it's not really saving them money. Also the cost of ownership for a Tesla is nearly break even for gas powered vehicles due to electricity costs in CT.
Lucky you. I received a door ding and couldn't find the culprit. The footage recorded two hours later when the ding occurred. IDK why some footage is never recorded when some people drive up next to your vehicle.
"In my department, we have to spend *thousands* of dollars on specialized cameras (just two or three) to meet SOGs. I always felt they were over priced. 

After seeing a ton of Sentry videos, I have to agree - the 8 cameras on a Tesla are each better than what we break the bank on in our department vehicles, and we wouldn‚Äôt have to install and maintain them ourselves."
"Can confirm. Seattle police were gushing over what I thought was ""shitty sentry footage"" when I ran a hit and run with them through my laptop."
"That's pretty pathetic, because Tesla's camera quality is not great. I can't imagine how bad the squad car's footage is.

I really hope the Model Y has 4k cameras to get clearer video."
"The killer app is a pass through so that it both stripes a hard drive, while also offering live preview. This is something that Tesla can develop and test for these type of fleets, and while not directly providing it to the consumer versions (mainly due to battery drain and data stream), they can turn a blind eye allow 3rd party solutions to achieve similar results.

I also can see cel data providers offering vehicle-only data plans, as they do with tablets, where the chips are put directly on the car, and the whole vehicle is it‚Äôs own ‚Äúsmartphone‚Äù."

"How do I save the sentry mode footage. When I have sentry mode on, I can't seem to fund it anywhere"
"Slightly related, but I had that on my home cameras. There was an issue opposite us and the police asked if they could look at the footage. The woman said it was such good quality she sent her boss back the day after so I could tell her the make and model."
"> After watching the footage, the officer literally told me that the footage is better than his squad car produces.

That must be a low bar then. Sentrycam image quality is nowhere as good as a $40 dashcam you get off amazon."
"Question, what would happen if you got hit and it was caught on camera but were never able to find the culprit? In terms of insurance? As I understand it if your car gets hit while you aren‚Äôt there and they take off, you will get a hit on your insurance rates. Would being able to show this kind of footage negate that? Or is my understanding of insurance fundamentally flawed somehow"
"I have heard that the video quality on body cams and squad cars is a low resolution intentionally, so that it more closely represents what the officer can see."
"Yeah, it's how they calculate a $12,000+ savings on gas *alone* every 3 years."
"> Tesla should offer a ""LEO"" version of their operating system, so the data functionalities that the police needs like looking up plate numbers or accessing criminal databases can be done straight from the main touchscreen and not need a seperate laptop.

What they really should offer though would be the ability to add third-party software, even if it needs to be certified by Tesla. Tesla is not the company to make all the integrations that could be made for ambulances, fire departments, taxi services, disabled drivers, etc."
"Elon's brain will read this as ""Low Earth Orbit"" and go off on a strange tangent."
"
>I¬¥d love to see statistics on how many miles a patrol car actually drives during an average shift.  ""Not many"" is my guess.

I can actually provide some information on that.

""Not much"" seems correct. In my county sheriff patrol cars average about 1200 miles a month. I'm not certain how many shifts per vehicle that may represent, nor do I have hard numbers on idling (or total engine) time, but they are getting probably about 25% lower mpg than expected, so it's probably a reasonable amount of time."
L3O
"Remember seeing a report that a squad car is driven around 30 miles per shift on average. 

 Useally most cops stay in their  department area so they really don't need to drive too far to get where they need to be.  Of course they sometimes have to make runs to court house or pick stuff up or chase idiots. 

Of course this probably doesn't apply to departments in suburban  communities  as they would have much longer drives."
"Not sure about Highway Patrol, but I've read in previous threads that squad cars tend to drive no more than 180 miles a day."
"Problem is the cameras used for license plate recognition are IR cameras that have specific lenses on them to enable a good capture of the license plate (the field of view about a 4'x4' square). The license plate itself is highly reflective to IR and the letters are not, so you get a negative image of the plate which the computer can read pretty easily. 

The cameras in Tesla's are not designed for license plate capture in the same way. You may be able to see it and read it yourself, but a computer cannot. 

I suppose the officer can just type it into the computer or use voice commands, but at that point you will be better off just installing a regular LPR system."
">Tesla should offer a ""LEO"" version

I just threw up in my mouth a little."
plus the acceleration is insane
Doubt CJIS lets that fly.
"Tesla LEO version v.1
-added native pornhub app

Atleast that's what the cops I know would want to see added most."
Teslacams don't record audio though.
"When the truck rolls out every dept in the us that can afford it will get it. It already has a lightbar, is bulletproof to hand guns, has a generator and compressor on board... not to mention the 0 - 60 and fuel savings."
Why would people have Electrek blocked?
">though they may be saying that just using the 12v and relying on the DC->DC is basically running everything off the 400v line. NOTE: I am not saying their electronics are 400v just that they would have used their own 400v->12v/24v to power the added stuff.

Even with modern LEDs there can be a very substantial draw on the 12v system for lights, sirens, computers, radios, etc. It makes sense that would likely overwhelm the built in DC-DC converter, and would require them adding their own."
Or hold them accountable for breaking the law and man-slaughtering civilians.
"Lol what a joke.

 Wood was not negligent because police officers are expected to respond quickly to messages from colleagues: 

Apparently endangering lives and killing people take second priority to answering emails."

I really hope Tesla doesn't actually help drive us further into the police state. Why are so many people so excited to do so? Have you not been paying attention to the world?
The service times are a pretty major negative though
They probably take the old body parts off then melt them down and re-make them to save on money and the environment.
"The thing is, there is basically a zero percent chance the thing is going to be certified bulletproof to 9mm."
You apparently have a really nice patrol car. Every other LEO in this thread has been praising Sentry Mode for being radically better than their patrol car's cameras.
I look forward to living in my CT as well.
"Police cruisers don't get to use modern dashcams, though."
"you can outrun their car, but you can't outrun their Motorola..."
Gas prices in CT aren't great either.
"They specifically stated that they expect to save over $12,000 in gas over 3 years with the Model 3 patrol car. Remember, police cars don't use gas like normal cars. They largely sit still, idling for hours, blowing through gas for no practical purpose besides heating and being ready to go at a moment's notice."
I was driving when I got my door ding. Yay! https://youtu.be/rOG0ftC35FM
How much do you spend on cams normally? Wondering how much it would save vs car price.
They are 100% overpriced and of crap quality.
What are the specialized cameras used for? License plate recognition?
"> I really hope the Model Y has 4k cameras to get clearer video. 

I listened to a podcast where a journalist complained to an engineer at GM as to why the Corvette's track recording camera is only 720p. The Engineer's response was that is/was the highest resolution camera that meant their environmental specifications (I.E. work while sitting directly in the sun at high temp for 10 years, etc)

Likely a factor for Tesla (at least I hope it is) as well."
"Police probably have the cameras coming from some vendor a sweetheart donor to a senate seat owns, so it'll be far from the cream of the crop tech."
"No way.
4k cameras would require a huge step in processor power to process all those needles pixels."
"The output quality is not the full quality, so you can't quite say the cameras are insufficient, apparently the raw feed is significantly higher quality. Elon did indicate not long ago that they would look at enabling higher quality output for dashcam purposes."
"Lol people are so ungrateful. Those cameras were only designed for autopilot, sentry mode came after.."
[deleted]
"There are very few CCTV camera vendors that put the effort in to make quality cameras. Camera equipment gets expensive very fast when you start introducing quality glass and sensors, and often vendors try to make the cameras as cheaply as possible to sell more and boost their margins. Tesla's cameras are better then most I've seen.

Edit: you can have awful quality cameras that technically meet the ""HD"" or ""4K"" requirements. Pixel density is mostly a marketing gimmick at this point, it does not tell you the lines of resolution, white balance, or color accuracy capabilities of the sensor & processor."
That‚Äôs a whole lot of money.
RED 6k or go home
Have you seen the DUI footages?  They are horrible
Woah. Your last point is nuts I can totally see that happening almost guaranteed
"Conversely, vendors sell to the government at inflated prices."
You take your USB from the car and plug it into a computer and save it.
"Yeah, basically if your insurance company can't verify that someone else was at fault and be reimbursed for what they paid out, then your premiums go up. If someone else is verified to be at fault, your insurance company subjugates the payout to the at-fault driver's insurance (or the driver him/herself), and your premiums *shouldn't* go up. With my footage, I proved who was at fault and their insurance paid everything and my premiums didn't go up.

You can read my whole saga here - https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e3kgre/update_diminished_value_claim_for_model_3_accident/"
"and that per mile it's cheaper to charge an EV than it is to fill a car with gasoline.

But my original comment was more saying how it's better for the police department, better for the cops, better for the environment, etc., etc.  Like there is literally no downside to municipal police departments switching to an EV fleet.  

(Highway patrol on the other hand have a harder sell due to the miles they travel in a shift and possible need for a vehicle with higher top-end performance.  )"
Except you still can't buy Tesla's in CT due to the dealerships lobbying. That cruzer had to be purchased in NY or MA. Goodbye 3k sales tax.
"Firefighter here. The CAD system I use has an [iOS/Android tablet version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hexagonsi.intergraph.responder) of the mobile computing software, with hooks into the appropriate systems that police would need. The next iteration is supposed to be fully web-based if I'm understanding their roadmap correctly. So even the included web browser might be enough."
"I could definitely see a third party doing certified Tesla custom software layer or something. For police obviously the software that they usually run on laptops or smartphones, taxis get metering and navigation etc.
But I guess they'd need to do it for most electric cars then, as ford, Kia etc will use different infortainment systems"
Some application that would allow you to enter some unique key to dynamically load an application from any company over the internet would be great.
But a tangential orbit would require reaching escape velocity.
"He might even shoot a Tesla into space. Oh, wait... he already did."
Hey I did 2
Well he already did low solar orbit so it couldn‚Äôt be thaaaat hard
That's how I read it...how is it actually being used in this context?
"I'm in a larger city. Cars get way more miles on them than that. 


EVs wont work for us for a few reasons.

1.) Initial price point would make purchasing laugh. 


2.) We have a high incident rate of vehicles being damaged. If it is anything like the stories I read about here, they can't be down that long.


3.) Lack space for charging area


4.) The terrain is pretty rough. I'm unsure an X could take the amount of shock it would experience in it's life. A fast accelerating car with lots of speed bumps...just not seeing it. 


5.) Cops are extremely rough with stuff. They break everything. Goes back to repairs. Long out of service times could be catastrophic. Even the duty belts trash vehicle seats, doors, ect.


6.) Gear would require a Y or an X. 



I think one day that could change, but repairs would have to be accelerated first. Cybertruck looks way more rugged, but I'm just not sure how a cage would work in it. I'm sure it's possible, but just have to see how it plays out when its released. Repairs on CT could be a costly nightmare as well."
"If Tesla can pull of (which I believe is still a big IF) FSD, then something like recognizing the lettering on a license plate will be absolutely trivial. I suspect the current software would already be very capable of that type of work. Reading from a set of 36 letters and numbers is many orders of magnitude simpler than identifying every possible driving scenario and how to react."
"It‚Äôs weird because I‚Äôm almost more excited for emergency rescue (police, fire, ems) to get this thing than I am."
I hope so.  Much harder to hide a Cybertruck in a speed trap.
I really really really hope not. That would ruin the image of the CT.
Could you imagine a cop pulling up then getting the 4 wheeler out from the back and running around the back alleyways on it!
"Personal reasons, feel free to disagree: What did it for me was getting and a Model 3 Performance, writing articles about it, then getting upset when a month later the price dropped by like 5k-10k and wanting a refund. I get the want and disappointment but unlike many (who got what they paid for) made money from having one of the early performance model 3 for about a month. On top of that he has won one or two 200k roadsters from Tesla yet got upset they took his 5k-10k.

This isn't that important to me but other have complained about little original content (well the performance Model 3 experience was) and usually just rewords other websites and reddit posts sometimes giving credit but not always. I was glad when he separated out his opinion into a separate paragraph. Some poeple claim it is presented like news but really isn't more than a personal blog commenting on others work."
"For me it‚Äôs mostly because by the time the 1000 word article gets linked here, I have already read the three word tweet it was based on."
"I don't think we have enough info yet. people have mentioned wanting to run welders off of the truck. if it can do that, it should have no issue with lights and radios."
"If I were to choose which one I hold my breath for, Holding police accountable or them getting FSD, I think I will choose holding my breath for FSD as being more realistic."
"Holding the police accountable for their crimes? What are you, a commie?"
"That is exactly the mindset of how police are trained these days, and is part of the problem. There has been a militarization of the police force, and they are trained to have the mindset that they can be in danger at any given moments notice and they need to maintain alert status. That they need to respond instantly, promptly. They are peace officers, not soldiers. A step back needs to be taken to reassess their function. 

It is bullshit, unless perhaps they are in a bad area of Detroit ;)."
"Seriously. If it were my job to rapidly respond to emails or texts, I would not be given any lenience."
I don't think Tesla will have an impact on whether we're in a police state. that's not a problem created or solved by Tesla.
"we're still 1-2 years away from the cybertruck, so things may change in that regard."
"sure, it wont be certified as bullet proof, but when they can just go on youtube and see a video of it stopping a 9mm round, it's going to be a nice selling point."
Sure as hell better than fiberglass.
"2014 explorer with 64k miles? Watchguard video system. Only ever been at one department, so I guess that could be true. As someone that has sentry mode and a patrol car, I would never want to rely just on sentry mode."
"Not me, but the people who are going to run will either have a hideable plate or no plate so, yes... yes they can"
"Agreed. I really want to get a Tesla, but I pay 20 cents per kWh in CT and my current car (that's already paid off) gets 35-40 MPG. I also buy all my gas in MA so that helps."
"Damn, idiot fucked up yours and their uber drivers car for being a dumbass. How'd you handle the situation?"
Did you get that person's info?
"You had the right of way, but there definitely was a lot going on right there. Person trying to cross, car stopped to let someone out, tight space for you to get by due to parked car on the other side. You probably should have just stopped and let the situation clear. Easy to say in hindsight I know. I‚Äôm probably gonna get downvoted. Still sucks."
"Last time I spoke with our maintenance division, they were about $500 EACH, plus the main CPU and connection into a vehicle mounted LTE modem to send the data to the cloud.

And then we have to install and maintain all of that shit at the department level.  So, it gets expensive.  Having it embedded via the manufacturer would be killer.

If this Cyber Truck thing happens, I see it being a game changer for Chief vehicles in the FD.  And i saw LAFD just bought the first electric fire truck today."
Yep.  My $30 camera I got from amazon is better than the $500 cameras we have to buy as a department.
"No, for Safety, liability and insurance purposes.  Any accidents or policy violations are very thoroughly investigated and scrutinized, so we have to monitor the vehicle, driver, and surroundings.

Sentry + a deal with Tesla to release logs for investigation would solve the majority of this, and then we'd only need one camera viewing the interior (though I understand there already is one in some Tesla's, just not being used)."
[deleted]
Probably the same company that makes bank cameras
"Actually the most popular brand for law enforcement is Panasonic. It's something called the arbitrator system. It's Panasonic laptops, cameras and servers. The police car cameras will dump the video onto the server whenever they park at their HQ. And they are not cheap at all."
[deleted]
Are needle pixels the secret to sharp video quality?
"It‚Äôs not a matter of being ungrateful. If you want good image quality, you have to invest in a third party dashcam. Plain and simple. Sentry mode and a built in dashcam are nice, but as you said, those functions were purely an afterthought."
Did they improve the cameras? I thought HW2.5 -> HW3 was really just the FSD computer?
... because the government is perfectly willing to pay it.
If you get a drive that also has a USB-C port and you have an Android phone you can watch it on your phone without a computer.
"And what if you can‚Äôt identify the person that hit you? Like what if you can prove you weren‚Äôt at fault, but they can‚Äôt figure out who to charge the insurance to?"
"I'd be very surprised if highway patrol uses cars with higher top-end performance than a Model 3 AWD or Performance. The range issue is a meaningful hangup, though."
"This, and being able to charge AT the station I think is a pretty big plus."
EHhhhhhh I'd kinda want that crap behind a VPN.   letting anyone log into the police system from the general internet is opening up an attack vector.
"You are talking about something like mini-application in WeChat. In fact,  Tesla has a mini-program enabling users to locate charging stations, schedule a test-drive and share their experiences about driving a Tesla car in WeChat. This would be a good alternative to Android/IOs full-blown apps.  More info:  [https://walkthechat.com/wechat-mini-programs-simple-introduction/](https://walkthechat.com/wechat-mini-programs-simple-introduction/)"
Now you're being hyperbolic!
Law Enforcement Officer. It took me a minute too.
"This.  

I'd love to see a *total* cost of ownership analysis done on current police squad cars and/vs using Tesla squad cars."
"Ha! You obviously have no idea how these systems work. 

Tesla cameras are designed to be used for FSD, while I do believe they will get to FSD eventually they will never be able to read license plates at an acceptably accurate rate to be useful. Just because you may be able to see a license plate in the cameras image under perfect conditions does not mean that a computer can read them correctly on a consistent basis. Even systems designed to read license plates with appropriate hardware do not read them correctly 100% of the time. Often they return their top 3 guesses at what the plate may be and they search their databases against all 3. License plates get dirty, damaged, and otherwise can be obstructed. On top of that different states use different fonts which can be confusing to a computer. There is nothing trivial about it."
"As mentioned above, I'm a firefighter and I would love to see a Tesla Semi platform used for some fire applications. I do have some concerns though:

* Most fire trucks that pump water use a split-shaft transfer case that takes the output of the vehicle transmission and diverts it from the rear axle(s) to the pump shaft (in other words you either drive or you pump). I'm not sure how a vehicle that has its electric (propulsion) motors in the wheels/axles pumps water. Who knows, maybe you add one extra ""wheel motor"" and bolt it on to the end of the pump shaft, and then you can pump & roll (or just pump while stationary).
* Water in proximity to high voltage electrical systems and battery. The average pumper has 300-1000 gallons of water onboard in a tank, and moves a huge amount of water during a typical fire - some of it leaking to ground here and there due to the nature of the hose connections we put on the pump.
* Usable battery life. There are situations where a pumper may need to operate for 48 hours or more at a fire scene, pumping continuously. Due to the nature of the above pumping system, it would be analogous to driving for 2 days non-stop at 25-40 MPH. Not sure how long a battery would last. I guess we would end up having to send more pumpers to the scene to ""swap out"" when batteries get low, instead of just bringing a fuel tanker in and topping off the diesel tanks.
* Other hydraulic systems, this part wouldn't be a big problem. Things like aerial ladder trucks use a hydraulic pump to move and extend/retract the ladder. I expect it would be easy to make this work on an electric rig.
* Even less concern for the electric services a truck needs. My department is putting a brand new truck online right now, and in addition to lights & sirens, we also run onboard computers (one embedded in the truck for its own systems/equipment and one tablet computer for our mobile data terminal communication to dispatch), multiple two-way radios, exterior scene lighting including a 1500W extendable tower light, an HVAC system, and chargers for personal equipment like hand lights, thermal imaging cameras, and etc), plus we have a 6.5kW gasoline generator to run electric appliances like lights, fans, and other such things. Having an electric truck with multiple ""outlets"" for such things would make powering all this super easy.

Until such things are hammered out, particularly the concerns over water (both pumping and using in proximity to the electric system) and battery longevity, I think the best application in the fire service might be a rescue truck. Modern rescue trucks are basically a tool van - no water onboard - and could exploit the electric capabilities of the truck similar to my last point above; modern ""jaws of life"" style tools are rechargeable electric similar to a cordless drill or saw, and some of the other things we might put on a rescue are air-powered, so an onboard air compressor powered by the truck electrics would be ideal.

That all being said, Volvo and a fire truck manufacturer called Rosenbauer have been touring a prototype electric fire pumper through North America over the winter. LA City FD has apparently put down an order for one truck to evaluate in Hollywood, no indication of when they will receive it."
"Well, TWO of the things you said are actually emergency rescue."
"a nice use-case for wraps. make it look like a rock or a bush, haha."
It's inevitable. Not to mention it comes unpainted... who might that be useful for?
"That's what it was built for, obviously. It has a light bar, no paint so stations can paint it themselves. Is bulletproof. Has a gen and compressor. It's literally a police truck I don't think any of that was an accident."
I could definitely see them patrolling on the 4wheeler. Bar streets and beaches. With 2 of them parked they could be charging one while the other one roams then switch and always have someone on the street and in a vehicle. Add more for busier areas. It's definitely coming.
"It was exactly $5000, and Fred whined at Elon so much that Elon decided make Tesla send out thousands of $5000 refund checks, even to the people who *didn't* buy the Performance Upgrade Package, which was the $5000 option that Tesla made standard on the P trim without raising the price."
"I'd still want them to to have FSD.  It's provably safer, however you definitely see a ""Well this just happens because of the job"" reactions to accidents, fatal or not.  Bullshit, and anyone else would be in jail immediately for causing it."
"If you give people guns, they look for ways to use guns.

If you give people battering rams, they look for ways to use battering rams.

If you give people armoured cars, they look for ways to use armoured cars.

In most cases this involves immediately escalating any conflict to lethal force, and taunting the populace to encourage conflict to arise.

If you want to reduce the number of police shot in the line of duty, take away their battering rams, armoured cars, tasers, pistols, rifles, shotguns and body armour. Give them wooden batons or tonfa/T-baton/nightstick. Teach them how to de-escalate the scenarios they will typically encounter, and reach them how to observe without provoking conflict."
"True enough, but maybe don't provide them with better tools.

I mean, if we're going that route, imagine Tesla implementing a Law Enforcement Backdoor in your car's OS, and all they have to do is send a signal and your car pulls itself over. At any time, for any reason."
"> we're still 1-2 years away from the ~~cybertruck~~ Model Y, so things may change in that regard.

Probably could've found this exact comment a year ago"
Saying it *might* be able to stop a 9mm round is pretty meaningless though.
What the situation with solar? With such electricity prices it should make total sense... Or there is no net metering? Maybe look into solar + storage
"She was a brat. She tried yelling at me. Saying it was my fault. We were in the fancy pants area of town. I got out and yelled at her ‚ÄúAre you fucking stupid? Do you not check before opening the door?‚Äù That‚Äôs when she started saying I hit them. I was like, how did my back door, hit your front door? I ignored her after that as she was fucking still trying to blame me. His door was fine. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure what happened was she was looking at the driver while opening the door to thank him for his heroic effort of getting them to the wine bar."
"The lady that opened the door, no. The Uber driver, yes. Tried to help him out, but he wouldn‚Äôt give me her info, so I was like fuck it. I told him he‚Äôs going to eat shit, I guess he didn‚Äôt believe me and protected the lady that won‚Äôt give a shit about him. Car was fixed last year."
Nope. They shouldn‚Äôt park there and open their door into traffic. Especially when parking is on the right side of the street.
"> LAFD just bought the first electric fire truck today

Oh cool! I'd love to read about that.

Love this idea!"
"That's what bureaucracy gets you.  My buddies always laugh when they see ""mil-spec"" on anything.  ""oh, so its crap?"""
"You're absolutely right then, Tesla cameras are perfect for this application. The only reason the cameras should be thousands of dollars is for LPR cameras, they need specialized equipment that is costly."
It was a guest on the smoking tire podcast. They don‚Äôt talk about EV‚Äôs that much and when they do I cringe so I don‚Äôt recommend it if you are only interested in EV‚Äôs. But I love listening for ICE car info and they do often have cool guests on.

I will 100% agree with the lawyer in another comment that the body cams are by far more important. The in car systems are to record traffic violations, accidents, or accidental damage to the vehicles. Depending the system, they can provide a good shot of field sobriety tests in conjunction with body cameras."

"I expect airport crash tenders to switch to electric soon.  These trucks are designed to respond as quickly as possible to a catastrophic incident that in general will last only minutes.   Standards require 0 to 50 miles in 35 seconds or less - no joke when your truck weighs 50+ tons.  The Oshkosh Striker 3000 for example uses a 16L, 650 hp diesel.  Because the key factor for these trucks is power density, a battery electric drive train could easily outclass the current solution and result in lower overall maintenance cost."
Low-hanging fruit first. There's no need to cover all the edge cases at the beginning.
"Electrics are sealed. Should survive water Significantly better than any modern diesel. Don‚Äôt forget the battery and motor have water glycol being pumped around, they are already wet systems. This is an advantage not a disadvantage.

You could use an electric pump for hydraulics and water, though I would expect you won‚Äôt get days continuous pumping, you would need to plug in for that, but you would probably get a good 20hrs out of a 500kwh battery. So plenty of time to call for a generator.

Should be pretty easy to do something once you have the semi truck. The good thing is fire engines sitting at a station get plenty of time to charge, which will be the main issue. And on a 500kwh battery you could sit in a heated/cooled cab pretty much indefinitely."

I'm not saying it can't. If you think your Raspberry Pi model works as good or better with the same reliability and redundancy you should sell a solution like that. Panasonic makes billions off of arbitrator. You can take their lunch money!

"Out of curiosity, wouldn't the apple's native usb-c to lightning cable work as well? Or is there some chip in the dongle itself that is needed for it to work?"
"If they always use the same speed trap location, they could possibly get a contact charger installed. Some electric buses use those."
"For real, I dream ofif the day every stoplight and parking stall has a wireless charger just like my toothbrush, cell phone, etc, for topping off while you wait."
"I dunno. But if so, that means it's even *more* likely that the Model 3 would be a better pursuit car than whatever they currently use.

My concern about range is because Highway Patrol tends to drive a lot more per day than regular police patrol cars. That might be an issue when it comes to everyday use, since they may find themselves needing to charge part way through the day."
"Yea i get all that.  exposing an app like that to public internet logon is asking for trouble.   putting it behind a VPN is a big broad stroke of security.  given what the app has access to I like the idea of 2 layers of distinct security there.    VPN login, then app login.   combining into one layer isn't wise long term."
from a tech perspective i agree.  from a management and reality on the ground perspective i'm fearful and resistant.
"Good point, I'd forgotten about seeing the instances of people driving through floods. Ok, I'm less concerned about the water flow now. Still, the biggest thing people in the industry are saying about the Rosenbauer truck is how long it'll last (in terms of battery life). It may be suited better for an inner-city station where they do lots of short, quick runs. Like I said earlier, the biggest fear a lot of people have is being parked and operating (pumping) for X hours on a scene and suddenly you're out of battery power; can you recharge on scene, or drag it out of the way to put a replacement pumper in its spot, or are you screwed? In the current situation, we literally back a fuel tanker up to the diesel-powered pumper and top off the tanks while it's still running."
"Spain had Leafs driving around the area outside the gates where the planes are (no idea what it‚Äôs called, Airside?) at one of their airports."
"Absolutely true. But I also believe the reverse: If the police can own something, we should be able to as well."
"There is a reason that when the police and military determine what product to use they do more than look at promotional footage of it stopping one and say, take my money."
"To be fair... There's video of similar metal to what is *proposed* to be the construction material for the truck, stopping 9mm rounds, under certain circumstances.

Whether that translates into reliable stopping of commonly used rounds, as fired in the real world, at the actual vehicle, as manufactured, remains to be seen."
"No problem, Well here you have to go to an accident reporting center. You let them know what happened, sign some papers, then your insurance is automatically informed. I got an automated email right away. Then the adjuster called me a few days later. Not sure about the states."

"As often as needed. Nothing more, nothing less."
Do you not?
Anytime they're being fucking idiots like you.
"I'll take a seat next to you in the very unpopular opinion club.

"No, my insurance paid, and I didn‚Äôt have to pay a deductible as I wasn‚Äôt at fault. My insurance went after the Uber drivers insurance."
"Yes he does, it‚Äôs the law. She caused the accident. It has nothing to do with Uber at that point. It‚Äôs like fleeing the scene of an accident."
"Yeah an attitude of trying to help him multiple times after he tried first blaming me saying it was my fault, then when I said I have it on video saying ok maybe it wasn‚Äôt the way he thought it was. Then when he disobeyed the police instructions multiple times, and wasting my time, then asking me to talk to his cousin on the phone to resolve the issue (it wouldn‚Äôt). And I didn‚Äôt literally say that, I told him if he‚Äôs not going to give me the information he‚Äôs legally required to, it‚Äôs over I‚Äôm leaving. So I left and went and reported it. Get off your high horse. I told him he‚Äôs going to eat shit as insurance is going to go up for him since he‚Äôs not giving me the idiots information that opened the door into my car. He wanted to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù her I guess because she was going to corroborate his story, which wouldn‚Äôt matter anyway. So if he‚Äôs trying to play games, you‚Äôre damn right he‚Äôs going to rightfully eat shit.

And yeah, I‚Äôve had over 30,000 (not a typo) people in my car and I‚Äôve explained Tesla and evs to them, so you‚Äôre absolutely right, they will love evs with me driving around. Most of them even apologize for asking me questions I must hear all the time and I tell them it‚Äôs one of the reasons I drive (I love doing it), so I can tell people about it. Lol, you didn‚Äôt see this part coming either from your high horse, did you?

Oh and on top of that, I‚Äôve taken multiple people from reddit on rides because they‚Äôve wanted to ride in a Tesla and never had the chance. So.... how‚Äôs that high horse feeling now?"
"Except for the fact there was another car that passed them. If I knew the situation as you claimed I wouldn‚Äôt have went. I‚Äôm not expected to avoid a door opening. I‚Äôm not Nostradamus, how should I know how many passengers and which doors they are opening, and when they are opening them? You‚Äôre 100% at fault for opening a door into moving traffic. There‚Äôs no way for you to argue this. You‚Äôre wrong, and you knew that, that‚Äôs why you said you‚Äôd get downvoted.

Also you contradict yourself. ‚ÄúYou had right of way, but you shouldn‚Äôt have.‚Äù Then I wouldn‚Äôt have right of way if that were the case..."
well. It would certainly be compresseed like every video.

"It's perfectly wise long term, and even considered best practice in the industry. Check out Google's BeyondCorp paper. The principal idea is to host your user applications on the public internet with access control as God intended, rather than trusting a user more just because they exist on some ""trusted"" network."
"If the app is built right, it‚Äôs the same attack surface as a VPN."
"I'm not sure how their department works, but most devices I've seen use a built in 'VPN' which controls the network connection entirely (NetMotion). This allows the device to connect directly to the CAD system controlled by dispatch using AD credentials. The devices are mounted directly in the first responder vehicles, which are normally locked. There is plenty of security, as long as the user isn't a moron."
Yeah that seems fair. You‚Äôd need a new generation pump almost. Something low draw that can still generate enough pressure.
"Once you have a squad of electric trucks, what's the difference between rolling up a large fuel tanker, and rolling up a semi battery pack to run it all?"
"For a long job I wouldn‚Äôt rely on batteries. For an hour or two sure, but days... not a chance. 

The flip side however is that diesel powered pumps aren‚Äôt exactly hard to source. If you run the truck and ancillary systems from the truck and had a large pump powered by a small Diesel engine you could do this pretty easily."
"I think for power, ultimately an electric fire truck would need a generator onboard for the occasional long run.  There must be a generator out there that could provide enough power to the truck for it to continue pumping."
"Keep in mind, you're saying this would run on the Semi Platform (also to be able to carry that much water it would need to). 

So I think you're really underestimating how big the Semi's battery will be. We're talking potentially a 1MWh+ Battery. And while the Semi may only have like a 600 miles range when using that giant ass battery, it's because of the weight it's carrying - up to 80k lbs. To power a water pump, it is WAY more efficient because the only work it's doing is actually to power the pump, and the Tesla electric motors are highly efficient. 

So for example you compared it to traveling 30mph non stop. Well, if the vehicle has no weight to carry, the Tesla Semi would be able to travel a long ass time before it ran out of energy. Like the Model 3 has a 325 mile range at like 75KWh. If it had the Semi battery pack and we ignored weight, it'd be able to travel at least 4k+ miles on a single charge (aka 130+ hours at 30mph). Basically the Semi is going to have insane energy storage and and it'd be able to power a water pump on a fire engine likely for multiple days, not just hours. And thats not even taking into consideration that you could get a mobile supercharger to refill the battery multiple times (Tesla does have mobile superchargers), all you need to do is make sure it has more power than the power usage of the pump..."
"Obviously they're not going to base a purchase decision on the reveal event. But the video in that shows that the claims aren't just smoke and mirrors, like you seem to be implying.

Besides police don't buy bulletproof patrol vehicles today, anyway. So that's just a bonus on top of the other advantages of an electric vehicle."
Yes but whose insurance do you file the claim against? It had to be the driver of the Uber right? Not the brat's insurance
"So, constantly"
You got the insurance info for the Uber driver. Didn‚Äôt need to cuss at a drunk girl to get that. In the end you got what...at best a moral victory? Nice work stud.
It‚Äôs just dangerous. You don‚Äôt know what idiot roided out dude she has on speeddial to look for trouble and cause drama for her to watch.
Also lol. Can‚Äôt believe I got sixty down votes for questioning why you would lay out an f-bomb for a door ding. That shit gets banged out and repainted for peanuts.
What insurance do you have? My insurance makes me pay my deductible if I go through them. I had to go after the other insurance in a rear ending accident.
Wouldn't HIS insurance have to pay? Why did your insurance pay?
"What are you... it's not Uber's fault, but Uber is the only way you're going to find her after she's fled the scene. Does the app show you the driver's full name and home address when you order a ride or something?"
"Fault is one thing. Other people‚Äôs stupidity is another. Your car got dinged and you could have avoided it. Not your fault but you contributed by being in a risky position. As soon as I saw that person in your video I was surprised you didn‚Äôt stop given the situation. That‚Äôs my observation and it‚Äôs your car. 

Just because the light turns green doesn‚Äôt mean you should gun it right away. Often times people are running the yellow and early red light. 

I don‚Äôt care anymore to continue arguing. Hope you drive safe out there, people are dumb."
"You are correct, my bad. Looking at the comments in this thread and other ones, I (incorrectly) assumed that most people were just using external SSD drives, like Samsung T5, that have USB-C connectors."
"The point of a contact charger is that you don't plug in at all. You just drive into it, and the electrical contacts of the charger start touching the contacts on the vehicle.

So a cop could just bolt out of the charging spot without a care in the world, and catch up to that 100 mph speeder in no time. :)"
"you know, I just realized, with a Model 3's cameras and possibly a longer focal dash-Cam, they wouldn't even need to leave their spot, just send the video to the vehicle owner and tell them their now F\*cked.  

Granted, that person would be me and I don't like that scenario even if it's practical for Highway Patrol."
Ehhhh i've seen public service networks and account management.  I don't want a warrant out for my arrest because someone thinks a 6 charc password is fine
"your last line is the gotcha from a security perspective.   

open access via the web behind even MFA isn't ideal given the power these systems have."
Maybe use diesel powered generators till portable battery chargers are a thing.
"> Besides police don't buy bulletproof patrol vehicles today, anyway. So that's just a bonus on top of the other advantages of an electric vehicle.

This is the strongest argument - i.e. that it is a bonus you get on top of the other benefits."
"You don‚Äôt do that here. You talk to your insurance and they take care of everything. I‚Äôm assuming it went to the Uber driver, the idiots information was not disclosed to me, so the only information I put in the accident report was the other driver."
If needed.
"At best, next time she looks before she opens the door, white knight. Remember if you were in my shoes, she‚Äôs not going to fuck you for being a ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù. She‚Äôs a bitch, she deserves getting yelled at for trying to blame someone else for her actions and denting my brand new car. No one cares what you think. And so you know the police said get her info, as she‚Äôs the one that caused the accident. So you‚Äôre entire premise is wrong anyway. I‚Äôm sure the police know their job better than you."
"Nope, it cost 3,200$ to fix and a week without my car. You‚Äôre an idiot. You‚Äôre defending someone that had a terrible attitude and lied and said I hit them. Also you weren‚Äôt even there, so stop trying to be a white knight. She‚Äôs not going to fuck you for virtually defending her."
"I have Geico in the states and got my door dinged. Caught them on Sentry mode, called my insurance and they did a carrier lookup on the other car then claimed it as a hit and run against their insurance. My car was repaired and didn‚Äôt cost me anything. My premium even dropped down after the next renew."
"Well I‚Äôm in Canada, so it‚Äôs different if you‚Äôre in the states."
"I have progressive and live in a no fault state, but if there was clearly someone who was more culpable in the accident than I, my deductible is waived and my insurance files the claim with that parties insurance to repair my vehicle"
[deleted]
"She gave her info to the driver. So he can contact her as a witness against me. How hard is that to understand? I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre talking about Uber. She caused an accident and went into the wine bar. Also to answer your question, I‚Äôm a human."
"I couldn‚Äôt have avoided it, if I didn‚Äôt know it was coming. More than half my car had already past them."
I find it much more convenient to use a simple usb stick. You can get a 128gb one for super cheap and it saves me rigging an ssd.
"While speed reading your post missed the ""contact"" word!"
[deleted]
Wut? We have public facing government systems with sensitive information that is behind just MFA with no VPN. It‚Äôs considered adequate security for the information it stores.
They both have advantages. Direct drive is more powerful for the size and more efficient. A generator has more flexibility and can of course drive the batteries as well.
It isn't defending her to suggest that your behavior may have been inappropriate.
Tesla really is the new BMW.
Yes but your Carfax reflects an incident now correct?
"Well drats. 

Thanks anyways!"
Damn. I guess I need to go to Canada
What city is this. I don't recognize the area.
"Not exactly true,this only applies when you have full damage coverage on your car if you just have general liability, you will often have to go directly to the others insurance"
"Oh sorry, I didn't realize she did that. But then I guess she wouldn't do that unless she knew she was at fault, so what's the issue?"
"What do you mean by ‚Äúrigging‚Äù? External SSDs are small (way smaller than external HDDs), and you just use the usb-c cable it comes with to simply plug it into your car, just like a usb stick. Except they usually feature more space, as even my 512GB one has already filled up over 4-5 months."
I was being over the top.  I know its it a bit more than that.  I'd prefer dual layers between the systems and the public.   thats my opinion.
"local police depts != fed/state gov't.   

I don't trust local pd's to have the budget to do it right.  sorry."
"I was actually thinking the fire truck shows up and starts doing its thing. If it is determined it will be there more than the battery life bring in a diesel generator,  [portable batteries](https://thedriven.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EKZouDnUYAAEOZn.jpg), or the water trucks could have oversize batteries for V2V and plug in your 400V+ DC line. Thinking about it space likely is a premium around firetrucks so you would need a 100ft+ extension cord, not sure if that is a good idea either."
"No, it‚Äôs made of aluminum, which has much higher work rates."
This is the real question
Tbh any insurance in America is shit compared to outside of it
"It probably works differently in different parts of Canada, but where I am you pay the deductible if you're at fault. If you're not, then you don't. The person who is at fault has to pay both deductibles of they're both though our local insurance company. It's a ""crown corp"", a corporation partially or wholly owned by the provincial government. It works just like a regular for profit corp, but with the government choosing the board of directors and setting priorities. The main priority being ""for the love of god don't piss off your customers or fuck up so badly that it reflects poorly on our next election result"". This setup doesn't work well in some industries tbh (they've tried them all over the past century), but it works really well in the insurance industry because it eliminates the drive by shareholders for profit at any cost, so the insurance company doesn't see the need to falsely deny claims to drive up profits."
"Not so, I've had several times where my ins went after theirs and I got full compensation"
"Toronto, Yorkville."
It is true here in Canada.
"This is in Canada. In my province there is only full coverage. I presume the other provinces are the same. My province does not have private insurance, everything is through a crown corporation that is ""not for profit"" (they do have some products that are for profit, namely large semi truck insurance). So my insurance company typically only has to deal with itself during claims. Other provinces do have privatized insurance however."
Which is stupid. What could it possibly cost my insurance to chase down another insurance company? A few hundred bucks? I'd happy pay an extra $5-10 a month for that peace of mind.
"No, she said I was at fault and she gave him the info so when he needs her statement I guess to insurance she can corroborate the same story that I hit them. I told him that she‚Äôs going to leave him out to dry, but he didn‚Äôt want to listen. So I was like ok, I tried, too bad, it‚Äôs going on you."
"I mean having loose wires. I just think it‚Äôs cleaner than having a loose ssd. I also have found no use for keeping footage for 4 months, so 128gb is plenty for my use case."
"Your concern was first with the security of MFA, but now it's about the implementation. Also, the budget to do it right is pretty minuscule. I've seen some local gov have far better security practices than some federal agencies."
"That may be the answer. Just a deployable generator on a trailer. Parked down the road. 100‚Äô extension cords are easy, we use them all the time as shore power connections on boats. Just some back of the WAG math seems to indicate a 100amp cord should be plenty."
"Oh, you are right, didnt think of wires and such. If you or anyone else considering this are curious, i can post pics of how my setup looks, but i think it is pretty clean. Got a usb-hub made specifically for teslas for this, and it definitely helps with clutter and such.

I appreciate your points tho, mate, dont take it as a personal attack, i definitely see your idea. I am just lazy, so it isn‚Äôt like i need 4 months worth of footage, i just dont feel like emptying it out more often than that, as that‚Äôs a bit of a chore (moreso due to how finicky the whole sentry/recording setup experience is)"
It‚Äôs all rolled together.  Mfa doesn‚Äôt make up for their lack of controls elsewhere.
"Oh yeah I didn‚Äôt take it as an attack at all lol I‚Äôm always interested in seeing what everyone else did for their setup. I also discovered that you don‚Äôt need to empty out the storage anymore. A recent update made it so that the oldest footage is overwritten first, so I always have around a month and a half and don‚Äôt have to empty it out.

I also learned this by being lazy..."
But you‚Äôre assuming their lack of controls. They could follow all of NIST for all you know. You can apply your skepticism to literally every website ever.
"ooh, didn't know that, thanks for bringing the autodelete up. I recently disconnected my SSD because the car was throwing random drive write errors out of nowhere, and I thought it was due to it being full (as it was about time), but I haven't gotten to cleaning it up yet."
yea i could.      sorry but i'm gona be skeptical here on it.
Fair enough. It's always good to be skeptical.

"I'm one of those new accord owners. Tesla was too pricy unfortunately, plus I rent an apartment and park outside."
In Norway Tesla Model 3 outsold all Toyota models combined in 2019.
"I have trouble understanding the line for Tesla on page 5. It shows 4th-quarter CA registrations decreased from 2018 to 2019 by 46.1%, from 25,961 to 13,999. So I'm thinking, well okay, that was because in 2018 Tesla was prior delivering all production to the U.S. to help as many as possible to get their car before the maximum federal tax credit dropped. Whereas in 2019, Tesla was splitting deliveries between the U.S. and the world.

But then I see that it shows total annual CA registrations increased from 2018 to 2019 by 3.3%, from 70,326 72,625, which seems to undermine my explanation for the 4th quarter decrease.

Any one have a good explanation for this discrepancy?"
"I worry we have seen peak model 3. 

Right now model 3 is basically the only game in town for lots of people and they are willing to go with a sedan. With the model Y launching I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if model 3 never sees these numbers again (at least in USA)"
"Ok we REALLY need more colors. I‚Äôve got a roof rack and that helps with identification, but I feel a little sorry for all these other California model 3s in a parking lot."
"Hardly surprising.

About 20% of all global Tesla sales go to California."
"The thing is people were standing in line on new year eve at the Fremont factory to pick up their cars. Those are definitely in California. So Tesla didn‚Äôt exactly meet the demand in California. This means if Tesla met the demand, it could have taken on Toyota Camry."
Camry is such a great car.
"I call a Tesla, the Bay Area Corolla."
[deleted]
men and women lie numbers don‚Äôt
"Also outsold the Ford F-150, which is the top selling vehicle in the US. Granted, the CA market is different than the South, but that's encouraging"
"This is why the stock has been soaring. Basically it blew through the ceiling in terms of whether the **demand** for its cars is real. Now the **ONLY** realistic constraint on the company's sales is its own ability to make the cars. So the price is searching for the level that prices in realistic expectations for **future production capacity**.

This video shows why the current price corresponds to about 6 million annual vehicles produced & sold: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O\_H93Zu5Idk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_H93Zu5Idk)"
"OP, just curious what it was about this post felt it needed to be flaired Tesla In Depth?  Trying to keep categorization correct for others and I need to make sure instructions are clear if they aren‚Äôt."
But if you read Wall Street Journal there is a demand problem in U.S.
So modelY will destroy all competition
All while constrained by supply.. Tesla probably would have won otherwise
I‚Äôm guessing this doesn‚Äôt account for used vehicles?
2nd here in hawaii behind the Camry or corolla.
Offtopic post - other car brands are mentioned. Where are the mods!!! /s
"Tesla Model 3s are the norm now. Not cool anymore.
Soon teenagers will ditch it as they don‚Äôt want to drive their parents car.
Next"
"That's cause they have places to charge there in Cali, here in NYC its not even an option, or garage next to me charges $200/month extra fee for Tesla Charging, I usually don't spend more than $60-70 on gas anyway."
[deleted]
Tesla has definitely lost its cool factor. My work garage has so many Model 3s I can't bring myself to get one and get lost in the sea of Model 3s.
Wait for the new cost of ownership data. Commercial fleets!
A6 is not faring well. Yikes.
"Sheesh, how ignorant do you have to be to drive a BMW 5-series over a Tesla in today's world?

Like, the operational cost difference alone is absolutely astronomical."
"Yea if you take into account the interest on the loan over 5-7 years, it was double the price of an accord for me"
"Replying in hopes that you're within the window to return, and also to address other comments below... a new car is a bad investment, period. A new Camry or Accord in 2020 is one of the \*worst\* financial decisions one can make. If price was an factor, you'd be much, much, better off buying used. You can get a loaded, reliable 2017 Ford Fusion for about 15k.

In fact, I can envision a scenario 7-9 years from now where a 2020 <any new ICE sedan> has  a *negative* value. That is, you'll end up paying someone to come dispose of your old car, like an old water heater or refrigerator. About the best ICE drivers can hope for around the end of this decade is that the seller of the EV agrees to take the ICE off your hands for free.

40k isn't nothing, and renting does present challenges, but 5 years, you'll likely be able to sell a 2020 Model 3 for about 20k, while a 2020 Camry, Accord, Maxima, etc might be worth 0. And this is all before FSD.

Peace."
"Well, it's not the same as outselling in California. Toyota might already be selling much lower than what it does in the US.

A better metric would be to mention that Model 3 outsold _any single model car in 2019_. Literally 50% higher numbers than nr 2, and 3 times nr 3.

Tesla as a brand was only beat by VW, _by 150 cars_."
I wonder if there has been any measurable effect on Norway's accident rate since Tesla's are supposed to be safer.
Yeah that‚Äôs kind of comparing apples to oranges though - Norway has massive [tax incentives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_electric_vehicles_in_Norway#Existing_incentives) for people providing electric vehicles.
More people live in Minnesota than Norway lol
Not surprising when they make EVs VAT exempt - it's a whopping 25%!
"Cars that were purchased, but for which the registration paperwork was not finalized until January."
They made far more model 3s in 2019 than in 2018. Model 3 ramp only managed to really get going 2H of 2018 and continued increasing throughout 2019.
Model 3 didn‚Äôt reach full production capacity until 2H ‚Äò18.  2019 was the first full year at full capacity.
"Q3 and Q4 2018 were insanely huge for the Model 3 in the US. There was a ton of pent-up demand, and all of the cars Tesla was producing went to the US since they hadn't started international deliveries yet. Q3 and Q4 2019 were smaller in the US because only organic demand was driving sales, and cars were split between the US and other countries.

So why did Tesla sell more cars in the US in 2019 as a whole compared to 2018 as a whole? Because in the first half of 2018, Model 3 production was still going very slowly. They didn't achieve a fast rate until the middle of the year. So in 2019, Q1 and Q2 gains offset Q3 and Q4 declines. (Just in the US of course. Worldwide, even Q3 and Q4 had gains.)"
"Didn't a tax credit run out in CA at the beginning of December? Also, from reading posts about the year end rush for deliveries, it seems that they were delaying CA deliveries to the very last second. I've seen quite a few people complaining that they never received their vehicles at the end of 2019 so they may have screwed that up a bit as well."
One thing the Y will do is help facilitate a robust market for used 3's... right now 3's barely depreciate since there's so few on the used market.
"Obligatory Sunday Steve Jobs quote: ‚ÄúIf you don't cannibalize yourself, someone else will.‚Äù"
"I'm not sure if that's something to worry about or not. Model 3 will still be cheaper than Model Y and it'll still probably sell quite well. Yes, the Y will eat into the 3's sales a bit, but it's not like it's going to be ""Oh noes! No one is buying Model 3s anymore so they will stop making them!"""
"Maybe peak Model 3 in the US, but not in worldwide sales."
Even if that happens so what? The only thing that matters is Tesla's bottom line of profitability and their margins. It's not like Model 3 sales will drop to a point where it's unprofitable. It will still keep getting higher and higher margins. So saying you worry makes no sense at all.
Good the more expensive Ys Tesla sells the better their margins and profits. Plenty of countries with no model Ys for the model 3s to go to.
"Not even close. 

EV market is growing YoY and is small compared to total market. Right now Tesla is capturing most of these gains, and in time their share of the pie is bound to shrink, but the overall pie will be much larger."
Good as currently there is very high demand for them in Europe. Sold out until May in almost every country
"We seen peek in availability and not in demand.
Tesla sold all they HAD for US market.
if they would be able to increase total cars availability with 2 models and they all will be sold.
It is not like Tesla fulfilled US demand and then send remains overseas."
"As popularity increases and price decreases I don't think we're anywhere near peak sales. I remember when the Toyota Prius was getting popular at first he would see some then you would see a lot then it was every other car was a Toyota Prius in California, and now it's very much the same way with model 3"
"You could be right, but I suspect we will see higher volume going forward as more and more people are exposed to the cars first hand. 

The best thing a Tesla owner can do is let someone else drive their car. It's like 70% buy rate over the next 5 years."
"I wonder if, when the Model Y launches and becomes the new in-demand hotness, we will see a price cut for the Model 3 to keep units selling - could be a great way for Tesla to capture the cheaper end of their market (if they can reduce production costs enough to maintain margins), without cannibalising their other sales too much (since organic demand for the Hatchback / CUV Model Y will be strong, even if the Sedan is cheaper by then - though any price drop might lag behind the initial Y production run, in order to avoid too many 'price switchers'?"
"I don't think anyone is strong armed into buying a 3.  Maaaaybe 20% of the people ""settled"", but if you need to size you'd go for an X or wait.  I wouldn't buy a Smart car cause I wanted something efficient if the size didn't work for me solely because it was (hypothetically) the only efficient option."
We have almost certainly hit peak Model 3 in the US. The US has long hit and passed peak sedan - demand is falling in all segments for sedans as customers flee to SUVs quickly. Model Y is launching and will certainly become the new star in the lineup.
"We have not.  So many people are uninformed and ill informed about Tesla.  But- now they are seeing 3s on the road- and their neighbors and they are hearing directly from owners about how amazing it is.  Gas is being artificially kept at $2-3 a gallon right now by Republicans- at some point this will change.  Gas will due to policy or market very soon become expensive in places outside California.  When gas is $5.50 a gallon in Indiana, you will see a long of SUV driving moms realize they cant do it anymore- you get the idea.

If we elect the right people in the USA, we will see a return of the EV incentives that have expired on Tesla. This will also make it more attractive."
I just want a model 3 wagon not a crossover.  Wagons handle better w better aero!
"Why worry, these are sedan numbers.  Has nothing to do with SUV numbers.  The goal for Tesla is to make different variations of each different car type on electric skateboards.  That way the tech is across all different types of consumers.  Tesla can turn all different types into loyal Tesla customers.  The network effect will continue to build with highly efficient vehicles.  EVs are 90% efficient compared to 20% energy efficient ICE vehicles."
Model 3 is still supply constrained.
"Custom paint jobs, vinyls, stickers... remembering where you parked...lots of options"
Me too.
Wow
"Somebody commented somewhere that Shanghai will have capacity of 6 million on its own, but I can only find Tesla ever mentioning ramping up to 500k. Who is right?"
It was late night and that flair looked right lol. Feel free to change it.
"Nah, new car sales"
"Where the fuck are you seeing $100,000 Model 3s? Many people can afford $40K sedans, Tesla or otherwise.

Almost all the Tesla‚Äôs you would see on the road if you crawled out from beneath your rock are most definitely below $70K and I dare say the average selling price is probably closer to $60K."
Are you new here? Cost of ownership of model 3 low trim is LESS than an Accord.
Doesn't make it less fun.
"Well, you might not have charging infrastructure."
"Probably save at least 10k in gas over that time too. And another grand or more in oil changes. And that is very low ball numbers, in CA I'd say it's probably like 15k in gas and 3-4k in oil change and service. And at the end of that 7 years you still have a very good car with 90% battery capacity, and who knows how many updates. Not to mention depreciation of a Tesla is going to be far less than a Accord. You could probably sell the Model 3 for the price you bought your Accord after 7 years, and almost coming out ahead in what you spent from the fuel and maintenance savings. Throw in if you bought before this year the amount of rebates and tax incentives you are undoubtedly paying more over 7 years for a car 30k MSRP or more, looking at a SR+."
"**TLDR**

I'd pay another ~$9k on the cost of the car if I went with Tesla. Cost being MSRP + taxes + fees + interest. Does NOT include insurance, fuel, maintenance, etc. 

**Details**

For my 1.5L Sport it was $28k total including taxes and an extended warranty. MSRP was about $28k but I got it for $23.8k after labor day. 

As far as financing, I did $14k down and got a 4 year $14k loan at 2.85%. I'll end up paying ~$700 in interest so let's round it up and say $29k total. 

I could pay off the loan now but I instead stuck half of the money in a high yield savings account netting me ~1.9% and half in the market which is doing well. 

If I had bought a Tesla Model 3 it would have been ~$36k (MSRP + taxes/fees - incentives) leaving me with 22k in loans. To keep the same monthly payment I'd have a 6.5 year loan (doesn't exist but best with me). At 2.85% that'd be ~$2.1k in interest putting me roughly at $38k. 

Notes: 

1.)IDK if Tesla needs extended warranty or anything. Assuming no. 

2.) Not sure of how accurate my price was for the Tesla. 

3.) I'm comparing base model 3 vs my 1.5L sport Accord."
Double? I priced out an accord for $30k. After my rebates my model 3 was $40k. After fuel savings and lower depreciation there‚Äôs no price difference.

"I think the renting point was more about the ""parking outside"" and unable to charge. 
Otherwise, totally agree.   I can't fathom ever buying a new car.  I earn good money, but it's such a bad investment I just can't bring myself to even consider it.   My colleagues tel themselves stories about the great finance deals, and when I ask them to ‚Äúplease show me how I can convince myself to do this‚Äù their maths and mental gymnastics are totally at odds with each other."
"Also, Norway had huge tax and other incentives like free car pool usage. Some of that has now been reduced."
"Toyota was the 3rd most sold brand in  2019 and the 2nd most sold in 2018.

There are no clear conclusions as to why this is, but one theory is the massive acceleration and that many owners live in city centers."
"2017, 2018 and 2019 all had around 110 road fatalities."
"Heck, LA county in CA has almost 2x as many people as Norway (~10.1M vs 5.3M)"
"If your mean the California rebate, it dropped from $2500 to $2000, unless you qualify for the low income rebate."
"Exactly. That way it's not a one-trick-pony. The Y appears to be a nice upgrade from the 3 too, probably not a fluke, so hopefully it's a great business decision."
"I keep hearing that Tesla's don't depreciate but I don't think that's fully accurate. 

I bought a LR RWD w EAP new in April 2018 for $62k after taxes and fees. At the time I was able to get $7500 back in taxes and $2500 CA rebate and $450 back from Edison. Prices have dropped significantly since the early days even though the Federal credit is gone. My car was $51.5k after getting the money back and current market prices the used 3 w EAP at $40k. $11.5k depreciation in 22 months isn't stellar ($522 a month) so many buyers are reluctant to take a bath on their totally functional cars.

Second time around I came out ahead by purchasing a new demo P100D X from Tesla. Got a $160k original MSRP car for $81.6k at an end of quarter blowout for a fully maxed out X and still got $3750 fed tax credit. I feel for people who had purchased a S/X P model before June 2019 as they lost $40k in value overnight. Tesla's pricing continues to drop for new cars and improving hardware is constantly being added. Don't buy a Tesla believing it will always hold value but get it because you are happy with it in current form knowing it will get much cheaper."
"Agree. 

I think there are a few factors that will come together to help out the used market this year. 

Which as a owner isn‚Äôt then eat for me."
Worry was the wrong word. My prediction is the Y will eat in more than a bit it will eat in a lot. I don‚Äôt see the 3 going away but may make Tesla question a 2 sedan lineup.
"Ya lol taking sales away from its own models is not the worst problem to have.. This sort of thing gets discussed in r/ cars.
People sometimes say Honda wouldn't make civic hatch si because it would eat into type r sales or brz wouldn't get 240-250hp next gen cuz it would eat into wrx sales but how bad is it to lose sales to other models from the same manufacturer? Sure its not ideal but money is still coming in"
I just looked it up. The model Y is only a couple of thousands more. So it could be a concern.
Worry was the wrong word. I hadn‚Äôt had my coffee let‚Äôs say predict.
"Genuine question but why? Whats so much better about the Y for people in the US? Seems quite a US centric mindset to have a big car just because its available, but I have never really understood this unless you legit need the space."
"My thoughts on ""peak sedan"". Maybe the auto makers should stop selling ugly, barely incrementally changing sedans and people would buy more of them."
"Then one day you will be advanced summoning your car to the train station and there will be a procession of five cars all the same as yours, the only difference being the rego plate!"

"Tesla will definitely save huge amounts of money on day to day operating costs. 

**Fuel** I drive ~12k miles/yr and get 27 mpg. After 7 years that'd be at 84k miles. At $4.25/gallon that's $13.3k.

**Oil** I need to get an oil change every 7k miles. I pay ~$60 a pop meaning that'd be $720.

So fuel + oil is ~$14k for 7 years. 

Tesla, according to a post on their forum, is .[0518 cents per mile](https://forums.tesla.com/forum/forums/cost-drive-tesla). At 84k miles that would be 4k resulting in nearly 10k savings vs gas.

Edit: I found this calculator and it's saying I'd save $1k / yr fuel costs which would be 7k, not 10k. Idk who to believe lol https://teslanomics.co/tesla-model-3-fuel-savings-calculator/"
"I did some math when choosing the car last year and was considering Tesla M3 among other options.

For M3 I speculated that one can sell M3 standard+ 5 years later for $20k and long range for $25k and I included that in calculation as well.

I considered for myself so I literally included everything there is: maintenance, tires, insurance, car wash, registration, chance of failure (a lot of googling involved) multiplied by cost to fix it, state rebates and taxes, electricity cost and gas cost.

All expenses total with 10k miles a year Tesla standard+ and long range were both hovering close to ~~80 cents a mile.~~  62 and 69 cents a mile.

But used 5-year old Prius was only 28 cents/mile total.

Bare bones Toyota Tacoma surprised me with only 62 cents a mile, because of it's record best in US resale value.

I ended up with bare bones RAM 1500 classic which cost ~~about the same~~ 10-15 cents more per mile as M3 in case of 10k miles a year.

Edit: used Prius was actually 28 cents

Edit2: wrong tab in Excel lol. M3 was 62 and 69 cents a miles for standard+ and long range."
I‚Äôm tempted to look into a Tesla but have heard insurance costs are much higher.  Have you factored those into your calculations?  How does it compare to something like a Camry?
...$10k in gas?  My car is less efficient than a new accord and I would spend *maybe* $3k on gas over 5 years.
"Honest question (if you are browsing a Tesla subreddit and did the math, I assume you truly want one): why not just buy an already depreciated used car, save your money for a year, and buy a used 3 in a year when lots people are trading up to a Y and used prices inevitably take a hit?"
You don‚Äôt pay taxes on the Tesla. Plus get a tax credit.
[deleted]
I was referring to my case
"Norway tax on EVs: Buy a Roadster 2, get a Model 3 for feree."
Norwegian DMV
That's an interesting and somewhat disconcerting data point.
"Yeah, the Y is a more practical car for anyone with kids/house/dog. Right now I have a 3 and a Subaru Outback... when it's time I'm most likely replacing the Outback with a Y."
"But the thing is it depreciated because you could literally buy a new Model 3 with the same or better specs TODAY for much cheaper than you could back in April 2018. And obviously the reason this happened is because they dropped the price to increase demand and basically match/exceed the drop in tax incentive phase-out. It's unlikely a new vehicle sold today will see the immediate depreciation you saw. But then again, you also had a $7.5k Tax incentive...

The LR AWD today costs $48.9k, and yours isn't even AWD which is worth at least like $2k-$2.5k on it's own. So right off the bat, TODAY Tesla would probably charge like $46.5k for the LR RWD Model 3 if they offered it (as opposed to your $51.5k after tax incentive when you bought it). That difference right there is $5k of your depreciation! Sure yours has EAP whereas one sold today would only have AP, but that might be worth $2k max? Obviously it'd be pretty insane to be able to sell a used vehicle for more than they charge for a new one. SO yes you personally took a larger than normal depreciation off your Tesla. A customer buying today wouldn't have to deal with that major price drop though because the federal incentives have been eliminated."
"Doesn't depreciate is relative.

When my BMW was new it was losing about $1100/mo in value. When I bought it used for half its purchase price at 4 years of age it's been losing value at about $500/mo. Teslas are depreciating at about half the rate of a (generic) BMW - rarer BMWs (M2 for example) were only dropping about $5k in value over their first two years, and the 2016s are now in the $40s (sticker of about $57k) after the engine changes and such. Even rarer models ('06 and earlier M3s, for example) are gaining in value right now.

Or, for another example, Porsches - depending on the model and rarity - sometimes gain in value as they sit there (of course, your buy-in is usually about $250k minimum)."
I feel like demand is still growing and can/will be a ton higher than current supply. There really are not that many model 3s out right now in the US.
"The 3 and the S are in very different segments. BMW has 6 different sedans, if you count the gran coupes as well. Mercedes and Audi have  at least 4 each.

I think removing the Model 3 would be a huge mistake, and I do think that Tesla would agree with that. Replaced eventually? Sure. But leaving a gap there? Heck no"
Model Y is more profitable than model 3 so it's fine.
"I agree the Y will eat a lot of the. Odel 3 sales and I‚Äôm sure Resla is expecting that - let a different car ride the bubble.  Maybe it‚Äôll come out the other side half and half, or 1/3  3 2/3 Y, but they‚Äôll both continue to be high volume.

i wonder what Tesla will do next for models, once they have the major categories covered.  we‚Äôve Already seen them do in remental improvements rather than model year changeovers, maybe they‚Äôll also do something different with refreshes.  For example, maybe the S is worth major redesign to take advantage of some of the improved build process - does that make it a refresh or a new vehicle?  As another example, if the body style of the Cybertruck really saves that much money and becomes popular, maybe they‚Äôd think about redoingeverything in that style - yes, I‚Äôd  up a Cyber-Y (except hopefully they‚Äôll think of a better name). Anyhow, the point is that Tesla has surprised everyone before by not acting like a standard car company, so I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll keep us guessing"
Margins matter a lot at volume. Same reason movie theaters make most of their money on concessions and fast food on sodas.
"Hehe ok. But no need to think about it that way mate. The model 3 has room to lose so much ground and still be wildly more successful than most car models in history. Plus, the world-wide demand will continue to be crazy and Tesla will only be limited by their production, not by demand. Tesla will just be shifting resources to whichever models make the highest margins that is all."
"I'm not justifying it. but the trend in the data is not really debatable, IMO. The Y is still a small SUV here."
"For me personally, manufacturera have done such a good job of fitting the cars exactly to the average person that those of us who are not average find them uncomfortable.  Personally I thought I was good in my Civic despite being both big and tall, but I‚Äôm not a teenager anymore and my knees were acting up.  Once I tried my Forester, it was a world of difference.  I can step in, instead of maneuvering in, even in a winter coat.  I had enough head and leg room, even while leaving space for a kid behind me.  Yes, there is also more storage space, but more like the difference between trunk and hatchback - it‚Äôs just easier to get some things in and out."
"Partly because of space. US has bigger roads parking and garages in general so bigger cars aren‚Äôt really a problem to drive around. So you might as well have one for those times the extra stuff ace comes in handy. The only real difference is price, and obviously people buying Tesla‚Äôs don‚Äôt care what they spend on a vehicle."
Most Americans need the space
"Not exactly, you shouldn‚Äôt be supercharging in a daily anyway and charging at home is much cheaper. If I charge my car at night (in Riverside, CA) during off peak hours, a full charge on a LR model 3 would only be about $7 max."
I‚Äôm currently in the market and deciding on a tesla m3 vs the accord/camry/sonata etc hybrid models and I was wondering how much the savings would be on gas in CA vs electricity. Did you do the math or just some estimate from an article??
"If you can charge at home, it's likely more than $10K (I've saved that account in six years) even work high electricity prices, but if you have to supercharge most of the time, is a different story.
Elon didn't promise the network would be always free for everyone, he only promised or would be free for existing cars. He didn't break his promise, my 2012 Model S still has free supercharging. But the misinterpretation is understandable from the POV of sometime that didn't have a Tesla at the time he said it."
"My California Model 3 is $0.03/mile charged at home (over 36K miles). Our van is $0.28/mile in gas, and our old Prius is $0.12/mile. 

Quite cheaper. We did a 1400 mile round trip to Portland and saved $300 versus the last trip with the van‚Äîeven WITH expensive supercharging."
[deleted]
"yeah, supercharging in CA isn't cheap at about 26¬¢ - 28¬¢ per kWh, so if this is your primary charging method, you're not going to see the savings of people who can charge at home at night at an off-peak rate of 12¬¢ - 14¬¢ per kWh."
"What? Are you just assuming all charging is done at a super charger. If you don‚Äôt have access to home, work, or some other convient charging, EVs arnt for you.  You don‚Äôt compare cost of fuel with supercharging costs lol. You compare it with home/work charging."
"He never said the supercharger network would be free. He said they wouldn't be a profit centre. Ie: you'd be paying for the upkeep cost of electricity, maintenance of the supercharger. 

It would only be free to X and S owners as that's been baked in to the price of those cars"
"4.25 a gallon???  It‚Äôs 2.69 in New York...

That said.. Tesla‚Äôs are awesome and I want one"
"Doing a more personal breakdown as you did would be much more preferred. But in general charging at home is about 25% of the cost as gas. And maintenance is your oil change plus routine maintenance on a ICE, and even brakes. So over 7 years I'd assume new brakes, at least 14 oil changes, and 4X higher fuel cost. The argument to get an EV let alone one as useful and high class as a Tesla is basically to the point where your trying to argue to not buy one. Sure if you can't afford the upfront cost it makes sense to buy a half the price Accord and operate it easier. But if you can afford it, your lifetime cost will not only be lower, but you will have a much more enjoyable vehicle that's worth more at the end. (Who says you can't own and operate it for longer than 7 years too)"
$4.25?! Where do you live?
"Honestly 12,000 miles a year is a *lot* of driving.  That's 1000 miles per month, if you do most of your driving on weekdays, your averaging 40-50 miles *per day*."
"Still very close, and if your looking at it solely from a cost perspective than yes you will find better value, even with other EVs.

I would recommend everyone do these same calculations and I'm not saying you will find a Model 3 to be the cheapest. But the Value aspect is just as important, especially with people that can float a little extra you get a car u like any other car on the road."
Tesla insurance apparently is much cheaper now.
"My 2014 Fusion I pay $145/month for top tier coverage, it's worth 10k. My 2020 Model 3 is $135/month for not top tier but very good and reasonable 100/300/100. So I'd say it's just as any other car, especially through Tesla."
"Then you drive far below average, or live in cheap gas town I don't know what to say. I'm using very conservative numbers for the average adult. Be thankful you pay that little then and carry on."
"Sure, story time, strap in...

I originally had a hard limit of $18k. Then I did some research and decided I wanted Android auto and auto cruise control as well as decent horsepower.

I found some 2016-17 Accords that had that fit the bill but they were an EX version which drove up cost (~19k), plus the infotainment was slow as balls/ugly, and being used, that meant 30-40k miles. 

I thought about waiting for the 2018 models to come to the market (refresh year to my current gen) but those were going for ~$22-$24k and new were $28k. Additionally first year refresh years can be more prone to issues. For them to get cheaper I'd have to wait two years and that's too long. 

That's when I started entertaining the idea of a new car. Fresh infotainment, zero miles, I know every mile the cars driven, it's nice, etc. 

I figured that since I was carless for 10 months, waiting another month until after labor day to see if I could get a killer deal wouldn't be the worst thing. I put my name out on true car and got an offer back for $23.8. MSRP was $28k. Went in checked it out and the rest is history. 

Also helps that I've doubled my income over the last year and had some inheritance. Also the car is sexy as fuck (I've even come to love the crab claw tail lights).

And lastly, as far as Tesla, I'm waiting a few years till the brand is more mature. Next car is almost certainly a Tesla."
Or when Cybertruck hits and peeps start trading in their current Teslas...
"that‚Äôs what I have though my rebates may be higher than average (and I forgot federal is expired now or almost)it was like $42k
Edit - I was just looking at the packages on accord man there is a huge spread all the way to $36k"
Sorry can‚Äôt read haha
"Not really, but tesla has their best EVs in a price class that Norwegians obviously can afford with those tax cuts. If other brands would pull it off the tax cut wouldn't be so explicit to Tesla"
"How so? I‚Äôve never understood the appeal of small SUVs. It‚Äôs not like they can actually fit more kids (same seating layout), is it? 

The Y seems exactly like the 3, with more ground clearance."
I‚Äôm disgusted how true it is. I went from not married riding a bicycle to married and needed a car. If we had two kids along with my wife‚Äôs 3 dogs (2 large dogs) and my mother in law I think I‚Äôd need a bus or something. My MIL has an SUV but she doesn‚Äôt even drive so my wife says when we have kids we‚Äôll get an X... I‚Äôm just want that big old tank lookin cyber truck personally
"Good idea, I'm waiting for the Y for the same reasons."
A wagon version of the sedan would be even better than the Y.
"So, TLDR : 2018 owners and who would be the supply of used model 3s have felt a big depreciation.  2019 or new owners think the car resales for new!"
I assume it would be the S that gets dropped. Post roadster it is no longer the halo car.
"Just as the Model S learned lessons from the Roadster, and the Model 3 lessons from the S, the Model Y has learned a lot from the 3. While it shares 75 percent of the parts, the frame is made from much larger pieces, and one day may be a single piece. The wiring system is rigid, and has hundreds of feet less cabling than the 3. There is also a lot of speculation that the battery/cabin/motor/radiator heat pump loop has been majorly redone. 

A lot of other improvements are likely to be announced during delivery day. They don't want the Model Y to eat into Model 3 sales. Tesla doesn't care long term if you buy a 3 or a Y, but short term they want to sell what they can deliver within the quarter."
I‚Äôm curious.. how?
Also to be clear I am not trying to make a Tesla valuation argument I am strictly engaging in hypotheticals about model 3 numbers. So I agree on the front do who cares. I was just trying for have a conversation for fake internet points.
"Oh yeah not doubting what you say necessarily, just trying to understand what the appeal of the Y will be in the US. I‚Äôm from the UK so here cars are much smaller and people tend to get just enough car to suit their needs. But in the US I feel bigger is always viewed as better. I don‚Äôt know, I just feel the 3 is always going to be more aesthetically pleasing so can‚Äôt see people choosing the Y over the 3 unless they really want it? Unsure."
Fair comments! Definitely wasn‚Äôt questioning why some people would want larger cars for reasons like you listed. What you say makes complete sense especially for bigger/taller people.
I've fit half a stage of music gear in my Model 3 while my buddy fit the rest in his Mini. Sure a hatch would have been nice but people do underestimate the space inside a Model 3 with the rear seats folded down.
"For us, one model x and one model 3 fit the garage. Wouldn‚Äôt  want something bigger for my commuter car."

"Depends purely on whether you charge at home. At 300 Wh per mile, California electricity would cost you 5 cents per mile. At 30mpg (average mixed driving in the real world) a Camry would cost 12 cents per mile in gas, so you save about 7 cents per mile. At 15K miles per year, that's 1000 dollars per year ($700 of you drive 10K miles). With oil, service and other savings you might save $100 extra per year (Teslas require no maintenance of any kind until the 100K miles other that changing tires and adding water to the windshield washer).
So in ten years your do save $10k in CA if you drive a lot and charge at home. And you get to drive the nose amazing car in the road (I have an S an X and a 3, and the 3 is my favorite to drive). 
If you have to supercharge every day the math worsens significantly, and at 28 cents per kwh you might be breaking even. Your still get to drive an amazing car though."
"Keep in mind this person is only doing the math for having to supercharge (or rapid charge if at a non-Tesla station) as the only source of charging. Basically (s)he is unable to charge daily at home/work/wherever and during Off-Peak hours, which is significantly cheaper than using a Supercharger as the main source of energy.

Basically if you have to rely on Superchargers, it's still cheaper than gas, but not by a lot. However if you can charge at home/work it is significantly cheaper than gas, especially in California which has one of the largest differentials between Electricity Costs and Gas costs in the nation (top 3 I believe). So even though Electricity is expensive, gas is even more expensive.

Avg life of a loan is like 5 years, and avg miles/yr is like 12k, which means 60k miles over the life of a car loan. So 60k miles @ 30 mpg = 2k gallons of gas. Avg gas price for regular gas (mid/premium is even more expensive) in California is $3.49, so for 2k gallons, that costs a total of $6,980 in gas alone.  ... keep in mind I think the Accord gets worse than 30mpg while the Camry gets better than 30 mpg. The avg 2020 model vehicle gets 27mpg, so this is being conservative with gas costs imo. Plus it depends how much of the driving is highway, and how much is stop and go/city driving. The more city/stop and go driving in an ICE vehicle, the worse the mpg.

60k miles @ 0.24 KWh/mile for the SR+ Model 3 = 14.4k KWh used. In California avg electricity rate is ~$0.167/KWh, so that'd cost a total of about $2,304 in electricity. ... I think avg off-peak charging rate is quite a bit less than that (means more savings), but couldn't find the numbers in a quick google search. However it's also unlikely that 100% of charging will be done at home. Usually maybe up to 5% or even 10% of a persons charging is using Superchargers. Theres also plenty of free chargers around, and many can probably charge for free at work.

Anyways all that means $6,980-$2,304 = $4,676 in Fuel Savings for the SR+ Model 3 over a 30mpg vehicle to travel 60k miles. So that's basically every 128 miles traveled, a Model 3 will save $10 over a 30mpg vehicle. (or save $0.078/mile) **The more miles You personally travel in a year, the better an electric vehicle and a Tesla in particular is for you.** Then if you count an oil change every 5k miles, you'll need at least 12 oil changes, which at about $50/each is an additional $600 in savings just in the life of the loan. So we're talking over $5k in just Fuel and Oil savings for a avg driver in California after a 5year loan. Again you could be someone who travels 15k+ miles/yr in which case you'll be saving over $6.5k..."
"fair enough. I actually did have a Tesla at the time, We‚Äôve since moved to our 3rd lease and will be getting our fourth come December (have yet to decide what though, since we went from S to S to X and the X is no longer necessary for our needs but we do like the cargo space but hate the falcon wing doors)"
"People have different driving needs. I only spend about $650 a year on gas as is, there‚Äôs no possible way for me to really see overall savings. You've got to be putting up quite some miles or be switching from a fuel hog to have a good shot at savings."
Can you confirm the cost of your supercharging per mile for me? I haven‚Äôt really gotten confirmation on the cost yet so my estimates of north of 20 cents per mile may be off.

"Not OP, but this is about what I'm paying in the Los Angeles area."
SF Bay Area
Wow that is nearly double to what I pay and I live in the DC area which is still expensive in terms of COL. No wonder every other car in the Bay Area is a Tesla.
Agreed. I put 12k cause I plan to take a road trip or two this summer. I've had my car since Sept and just hit 4k.
"I guess.  $10k in gas over 7 years is more than $100 in gas per month.  Unless you have a huge truck/SUV, that sounds like a *LOT* of money on gas."
My next car will also def be a Tesla :). A used one haha. I‚Äôll enjoy my touring 2.0T in the meantime.
Thanks! I get where you‚Äôre coming from.
"> Not really

Yes really.

The tax cuts you get from a Roadster 2 equals the full price of a Model 3 LR."
"The Y has similar ground clearance to the 3, but is much taller, which increases interior volume, and is a hatchback, which drastically improves cargo practicality."
"Its not a great idea to put 2 full sized dogs in the trunk of a car.

I currently have an older subaru outback wagon as our 2nd car, and very few vehicles can touch its carrying capacity without going full on SUV.  4 adults, carseat and 2 80 pound dogs can fit in it nicely."
"It's not that it fits more kids, but the Y actually has room for all of their junk... strollers, sporting gear, etc. Also throw in a large dog (I'm not putting him in the trunk) and monthly trips to Home Depot (can't fit sheets of fiber board, 2x4's or long pipes in the 3) and a larger car becomes necessary."
"I have two four door sedans with a 4 year old and 8 month old. Our family can fit in either as there are four seats. 

But if we are going anywhere like the park or something we have to drive two cars because we can't fit the stroller and bike and diaper bag and the balls and the helmet and the.. in one car. I have tried. The trunk wont close without crushing everything.

So we will be buying a small SUV solely for the extra space to fit all the stuff.

Edit: and all this doesn't even account for our two dogs"
"Easier to carry strollers, bikes, a dog, etc...
It is not about the people, it is all the stuff that comes with the"
Taller so more 'roomier' as it adds more volume. Seating high up as opposed to hunching down is a huge sell especially for people with small kids as they don't have to lean over to fit them in a car seat straining their back. Good for large dogs as well since you get more room due to the hatchback shape.
"> The Y seems exactly like the 3, with more ground clearance.

Like a *hatchback* 3, which is what I'm after.  The ground clearance difference is so trivial as to be useless.  I really wish the 3 had been a hatchback or liftback from the get-go."
"One thing people are missing in the responses is that people like to sit higher than other cars on the road, especially in the USA. Hence the popularity of SUV's in the US rather than hatchbacks/wagons."
"But my point is the vehicles themselves hold up for depreciation well. The important thing about the depreciation on the early Model 3's is you have to account for the drop in price which was obviously mainly due to the drop in Federal Tax incentives. This isn't something that is just going to be happening multiple times over the course of the life of you owning the vehicle. It really is basically a mostly one time thing. So I think taking away that impact of the Tax incentive-Price decrease on depreciation is what you need to do to really look at how these vehicles hold up over time for resale value - at least from future buyers perspectives. 

I do think its ridiculous people thinking the Model 3s should be able to reslae at essentially New prices. Pretty crazy imo. Like why would I buy the used version over a new version if it's within a couple thousand?"
Your thought process on this is very shallow. There is no chance Tesla will drop any of their models. They are all and will continue to be wildly successful.
"No, but the Roadster starts at 200k I believe so they won't want to leave that 120k price difference not filled with another car."
"Cheaper and faster to manufacture, higher price."
Redone wireing iirc.
"It‚Äôs the same basic car, being sold for more money."
"Yes, I get it mate. It never seemed like you are bashing on Tesla or anything."
"My wife wanted a CUV because of the cargo room and ease of loading, as she needs to haul a lot of items for work.  She also prefers the higher ride for visibility.  Niro EV fit the bill.  Model Y would have too, but we needed it last year."
"I'm in the UK too, and currently drive a saloon (sedan) after having hatchbacks and estates my whole life, and it sucks for any kind of transportation of cargo / shopping / dogs / bulky items etc., that my previous cars swallowed with ease.

I once got a (small) trailer in the back of my big estate car, and often had furniture and bikes etc. in my hatchbacks.

But... I could barely fit a flat screen TV in my current saloon car, despite it being in the 'large saloon' class. There was enough volume in the interior, but fitting it in through the saloon boot lid was a significant issue.

I really love the look of the Model 3 (and prefer it over the Y tbh!), but the Y will just be infinitely more practical day to day."
"I did the math once and I figured i have to drive about 20,000 miles a year for the model 3 to really beat the price of cheaper cars. Yeah buying a Prius would be cheaper in the short run. But I have a feeling my model 3 will replace 2 car purchases."
At 28 cents your still about 50-70% cheaper than gas unless your hitting like 70mpg.
Don't forget windshield wipers ;)
I don't have a Tesla (yet \*crosses fingers\*) and live in the Midwest. Outside of charging at home and superchargers there are not highly advertised places to charge (you mentioned charging at work). Is there a place/map to view charging areas outside of Tesla's superchargers?
"And your still not factoring in brake wear costs and other maintenance that an ICE will have to go through nearing the 100k mark. So I'd say another couple thousands in savings there. This assumes you especially use hold mode and Regen break as much as possible, which is a much more enjoyable driving experience anyway."
"The Y is looking sweet, and it might be nearly as large as the S interior-wise. I loved the FWDs in my X but granted, they are not for everyone."
"15k miles a year. But yes, if you don't put the miles in it's harder to justify an electric."
"It‚Äôs usually $0.26-30/kWh. 

https://www.tesla.com/support/supercharging"
My Model 3 averages 253 Wh/mile.
[deleted]
"This is not the experience of most owners. I pay around $250 a year for about 12,000 miles of driving. There is no cost argument for  teslas any longer.  What your are going on about Is true for all EVs. If you don‚Äôt have access to home/work charging then EVs in general are not for you. You cannot morph that into a cost argument against Tesla. Model 3 is cheaper to own than a lot of gas cars people ALREADY buy."
"Hardly. In CA 14 gallons is $50+ and most are filling up once a week. That's $200 for even a sedan.

Truck drivers have even more to save which is why so many are looking at the Cybertruck from a gas savings point alone."
"My grandad calls that ""saving money all the way to the poor house""."
Well maybe haha.. I just misinterpreted your comment as it's in favor for only Tesla.
There is also a lot of new demand for crossovers and small SUVs. So the Y should do just fine.
"For this reason, my brother in law keeps telling me I should buy a cybertruck, lol."
"You problem is the sedan part, not the car part. Hatchback would fit all that."
"Is the model S still wildly successful?  What will happen with no refresh? 
What does it cost to keep it up as a success? 
What is the opportunity cost of pulling resources off other projects?"
"Yeah and honestly that‚Äôs the only point I can make. Only issue... I‚Äôm not buying, I‚Äôm leasing."
Isn't that what everyone drives?
"I use RainX on the windshield so I rarely use them.
I proposed a Tesla engineer collecting filtered rain water into the windshield wiper fluid reservoir so Tesla would get rid of the only fluid they use, and he told me they thought about it but someone argued that saying ""windshield wiper fluid is the only thing you need for maintenance"" was more convincing than ""there is no maintenance"" so they never implemented that."
"Theres [Plugshare](https://www.plugshare.com/) where you can filter by connector type (any adapter you have). Think they also have an app you can use on your phone.  There's also [ChargePoint](https://na.chargepoint.com/charge_point) which I think also does the same thing. If you are just looking for superchargers though it's best to use Nav in your car. And [to see new superchargers](https://supercharge.info/map) around you, this site is good.

Also you can use [betterrouteplanner](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/) to plan roadtrips (possibly) better than Tesla does themselves.


But when I said charging at work, I literally meant convincing your work to install some basic level 2 chargers (about 7KW) in the parking lot like you'd have at home. Charging with that just at work (about 8 hours) is enough to go from like 15% to 90%."
Lol brake changes barely cost anything compared to the price of the vehicle and length of time they last.
"Actually a really good point. I‚Äôm just worried that it won‚Äôt live up to the comfort of the X. As someone who‚Äôs fully willing to spend nearly $100k on a solid comfortable car that‚Äôs great for road tripping, it‚Äôs hard to accept that the Y might be a better option, seeing as it‚Äôs the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù Tesla in my case. I‚Äôm starting to change my mind on that, though. Just as the model 3 used to seem like a budget S, it‚Äôs sorta in a league of its own now."
[deleted]
"o_O I can't even imagine $50 a week lol.  I pay about $25 every 2-3 weeks.


EDIT:  I didn't downvote you btw."
"No no, not maybe.

You _literally_ get $50k in tax cuts from a Roadster 2."
"so, one of them actually is a hatchback(Chevy Volt), but it's also a 4 door with 4 seats. Enough seats for us all, but even with the hatchback it doesn't all our stuff."
"I agree that Tesla should make larger visible changes to go along with the real and huge improvements that the Model S has gotten. But thinking that there is a problem with Model S demand even as it is, is going to far in my opinion. I see how people that only look at deliveries in the US could think that if they are biased. But Tesla is deliberately delivering more of all of their lineup in other countries. A brand that wants to solidify itself all over the world has to choose to distribute their deliveries and not just focus on the US where they already have almost 90% of the EV market."
"> What will happen with no refresh?

You don't consider the upcoming Plaid to be a refresh?"
"Oh yeah Tesla‚Äôs lease doesn‚Äôt make sense ( at least not to me). Hell, the used model threes are selling for like the new price around here so they should be free to lease lol.
Edit: maybe that would be a better way of looking at it you could buy one then sell in three years instead of leasing."
Are you joking? In the land of SUVs? Most sedans get like 40 best.
Thank you for the info!
"Sure but from a TCO perspective this all adds up in the EVs (especially Tesla) favor and enables someone who may only be able to afford a $30k vehicle be able to afford a $40k vehicle if they plan on keeping it 120k miles. Plus over 60k miles (avg miles driven over a 5 yr loan), you basically are guaranteed to need to at least replace the Brake pads once. Not as likely you'll need to replace the Rotors or Calipers by then, but it's definitely likely you'll need to replace them at some point in ownership of the vehicle if it's something you plan to get 120k+ miles on. Regardless, just replacing the Brake pads once should cost at least $200, and not unrealistic for it to be closer to $500. If you have to replace all 3 (Brake, Rotor, Caliper), you're looking at over $1k (including labor of course). So if over 150k miles you needed to replace the Rotors and Calipers once and the Brake pads two or three times, you're easily looking at $1.5k over that period. Well in California, based on the math above for a SR+ Model 3, that's equivalent to about 37k miles worth of Fuel/electricity (about 3 years for the average person)... so it all adds up over the long term total cost of ownership. Even if they are just minor expenses relative to the cost of the vehicle. And the more miles traveled, simply the better the savings are on an EV."
"The comment your responded to was about cost.  Also, my argument stands.  If your friend is supercharging 100% at superchargers, which I don't even believe you, then congratulations on saving $300 a YEAR over me except now he is wasting his life at super charger stations every week and wearing out his battery pack.  Those same miles in a gas car would be between $2000 and $3000 a year depending on  your mpg and where you live.  That's the comparison that matters, not if my dirt cheap home charging isn't quite as cheap as free.  C'mon... lets be real."
"I don't really care about downvotes, I'm not wrong and I'm trying to spread correct information to as many people as possible.

But yes, gas prices are crazy in CA. Above $4 a gallon on the regular."
"Haha okey, like, that's just an imbalance tax cut for EVs, a bit silly."
Yeah. My friend only got a Tesla to begin with because it‚Äôs a company car and he doesn‚Äôt pay for it. I mean for fucks sake his X is a $130k sticker and it‚Äôs not even a P100D. $1650 monthly payment.
I normally drove at 70 and I get passed by SUVs left and right all the time.
I couldn't have explained it better. When you look at owning this car for 10-15 years or even longer. The value and savings are huge. Which is what I am planning on doing and hopefully one-day giving the safest Car on the road to my children to drive as their first car.
"fair enough. he does so on company time while he is eating lunch, so it‚Äôs a no brainer, and the other 10% or so time that he‚Äôs charging, it‚Äôs on a company charger at the office. He‚Äôs not saving or wasting money either way, since he doesn‚Äôt pay for the car. Once again, this is beside the point because it‚Äôs quite dissimilar to my personal situation. I agree, for most people, it‚Äôs cheaper for EV‚Äôs. There is a small common misconception that EV‚Äôs are multiple factors cheaper, and this is not quite the case yet, due to increased registration fees (at least in California, due to the fact that there‚Äôs no gas tax if you don‚Äôt use gas), and increased electricity prices. It really fluctuates, there‚Äôs no one rule that can apply to every potential EV owner."
"Gotta make the people swap cars.

It's the reason Tesla sells so good."
Good lord! Model X - it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs a different company/different universe. I‚Äôd love to sell our older SUV and buy an X because the SUV gets 15 miles per gallon. But a used X is still $70k. Maybe the Y... but I almost perversely wish gasoline was $10 a gallon it would make these decisions easier LOL
Your talking about speed man. I'm saying very few people have cars with gas mileage efficient enough to compare to straight electric rates.
"Yeah, aggressive electrification of the car fleet."
"Ah, sorry, I misread mpg as mph. Yes, you are right, EV is still cheaper."
"Welcome to California,  here is your Tesla."
"This is beckoning the norm now honestly.

I live in a somewhat rural area of Florida and I see Model 3s and Ss pretty much every day now.

Every now and then I see an X"
Beautiful picture. The future is now.
The real losers are those hideous HOV stickers :( WHYYYY CA??? Whyyyyyyyy?????
"California, aka Tesla-land."
"I‚Äôm in Vegas and see them quite often, but we drove down to San Diego this weekend and like, I swear it‚Äôs just about 25% of the cars are Teslas."
I can‚Äôt wait anymore!  7 weeks before my M3 is delivered.  My wife just wants to stop hearing about Tesla every other sentence
"More like Model 3's rule the Bay Area and Socal lol

Good ol 280.  This looks like around San Mateo, somewhere up the peninsula?"
"I live in south Florida, and like 8 months ago you would see a Tesla once every few weeks. Now you see them everywhere"

Must have been the buy a house for a million get a free tesla sale this weekend.
"Remember when everyone wanted Priuses and they were everywhere, this is the new Prius, admittedly better obviously."
All of them on autopilot as well? Damn
My daily commute takes me through 92 San Mateo Bridge to South San Francisco. I say 40% of the cars are Tesla Model 3.
Shit with the gas prices there you can actually justify buying a tesla
This is my daily commute! It feels like 20% of the cars I see are Model 3s
"Holy crap! I‚Äôm counting four, anyone else?"
"In my town (northeast US near NYC) we would see like 1 now and then about 2 years ago. Maybe 1 in like 10 drives around town, if that.

Today it's like 10 every drive around town.

Most Model 3s. A few Xs and Ss as well.

I think when the Y comes out, there will be Ys everywhere. As is, my rough estimates show 12 or 13 out of every 15 vehicles that drive by are SUVs or CUVs.

I feel these will start getting replaced by Ys."
Love that freeway
"Can't wait till this is everywhere. My kids get excited when we spot one on a drive, the other day we saw 3 within 5 minutes and they about lost their shit. /s"
They are the new honda civic.  It is fairly frequent that we see them now in central North Carolina.  We have stickers on our windows so we can tell ours and not get in the wrong one :)
"In 6 hours in May last year I counted 80 in Oslo, Norway. Mainly S and X."
Glitch in the matrix..
It‚Äôs still amazing to me how common it is there but in NC in the deep south people still have no idea what the car is..
The new prius.
This is one of my problems and why I ultimately buy the I-Pace‚ÄîI know most people don‚Äôt care but I never wanted a very common car. It‚Äôs not an exaggeration to say the Model 3 is the Camry of the SF Bay. Add to that the fact that their are far fewer exterior options on them and you get a sea of sameness. Totally understand that I‚Äôm in the minority position here however.
"Same thing on 101 on my way to work. 3 model 3s side-by-side, all red."

It‚Äôs routine in Los Angeles to see two and sometimes three in a row on the freeway in the same lane. I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôre all doing it on purpose so the autopilots can dance with each other.

NYC they‚Äôve multiples as well. When we got ours I saw maybe one a week. Now there‚Äôs 3 within a block of me (plus I‚Äôve seen some of the new M3Ps with the dark rims). I drove through Long Island a week ago and was counting them for the first maybe 20 miles. I had to stop after the first dozen... surprisingly most of them were white X‚Äôs or 3‚Äôs with the odd red or blue one mixed in. That and I saw a cool forest green looking pre 2016 Model S.
They‚Äôre still pretty rare in Alabama.

"I live in Michigan and when I bought mine back in June (in Tennessee, because I couldn‚Äôt buy it in Michigan) I would often see people discreetly pointing, saw one cute woman say ‚Äúnice car‚Äù, and a kid at my daughter‚Äôs school would occasionally do a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worthy‚Äù now when I dropped her off. 

Today I‚Äôm just another 3 on the highway. And that‚Äôs not a bad thing."
I traveled to Florida a year ago (Orlando and Miami) and I don‚Äôt think I saw a single Tesla the whole trip. Glad to hear that‚Äôs changing.
So true.
I think so. I was on autopilot and we were all moving in lockstep.
That‚Äôs got to be remarkable even for the Bay Area.
Same where I live power is 7¬¢ a kilo watt did the math and it should cost me $.02 a mile to drive.  I drive 80 miles a day and have racked up some miles on CRVs. My model 3 will be delivered in 7 weeks.  My CRV is closer to $.13 a mile to drive with gas and oil changes.
Try living outside the US. Petrol here is currently at around NZ$2.50 a litre for super (what my MINI Cooper was using before I sold it) which is around US$6 a US gallon and even that's cheap compared with some places in Europe. My MINI cost me 5x more per Km than the Model 3 does so it is very easy to justify. For bigger cars it is more like 10x per Km.
Totally. And there was me on autopilot while I took this photo and probably a few behind me.
Same rented one in Hawaii and my kids now say they will never drive any other cars.  The Whoopi cushion and video games had them hooked
"Southern CA here. My kids and I used to play ‚Äúthe Tesla game‚Äù where in the 2 minutes before we got to school, we would all take a guess how many Tesla‚Äôs we‚Äôd see and winner would be the one who came closest. It would usually be around 4-6 per game. That was over a year ago. We haven‚Äôt played in quite sometime because it‚Äôs too redundant now."
Fair enough. I test drove the i-pace before I got my 3 but felt that the tech in it was too dated.
"I never get this, grown ass man wanting to get things no one else has so they can be a special snowflake. No offense. 

Seeing many Teslas on the road is a GOOD thing, that means 1). People that would've bought a gas guzzling luxury sedan didn't 2). People are believing in Teslas and their advanced tech that's years ahead of any competition"
"You can always get it wrapped so it looks totally different. Did you see the one that got posted the other day, had French fries all over it? Definitely unique! /s

But I think this is why people often mod their cars, like all the Honda Civics out there who want to look different."

"Yup, mine often ask if they can go out to the garage to play games on the car. :D"
"In many cases people don't want a 'common' car because they assume the cookie-cutter common car is bought because it is a 'boring' and a 'safe' choice. With the Tesla it is literally the opposite since the car is much better than any of its competitors and it is hardly considered a 'safe' choice when there is literally no other option that even comes close.

I bought a car which most people overlook (got a Mazda 5 years ago) when everyone used to buy a Toyota or a Honda. I felt both the Toyota and the Honda were really boring at that time and literally everyone including their Grandma drove it. I went for a different option and haven't regretted it one bit. But don't think this applies to a Tesla since it is legit the best EV in the market."

Electra as my wife‚Äôs alter ego when drinking is Petra and she has already called the car my mistress as I spend all day checking my phone for alerts on the delivery date.
I lived in Fremont for 8 years and it got so that the 4-way stop with all Teslas happened at least once a week to me. (and i was driving a Rav4EV most of that time)
"This, all of my work colleagues have them, my friends, neighbors, everyone. It‚Äôs insane..."
"Only half?

Considering that the population of city of Huntsville in 1950 was 16,000, and it is now on the verge of 200,000. I would say that you drastically underestimated there.

And the above doesn't even count the adjacent city of Madison, which had 11,000 in 1993 when I moved here, and it over 48,000 now. I would be willing to bet at least 80% are from out of state."
HODL
Thanks. I will say I‚Äôll just change my autocorrect from M3 to Model 3. As I‚Äôm lazy
"Yeah, but their 4-9 rate is like .38kWhr during the summer..."
"Well I was speaking figuratively...

But I grew up there. Believe me, it blows my mind how much it‚Äôs changed in 20 years- especially Madison. I was up there visiting a few weeks ago and WTF with that Trash Pandas stadium?!?!?"
HODOR!
"It‚Äôs great that you have something to motivate you and drive you to work harder. But I would caution that if you do buy one, don‚Äôt stretch yourself too thin financially. You‚Äôll enjoy it more if you‚Äôre not stressing out over car payments.  Just my 2 cents and good luck!"
Geez. I only worked 1 job at a time (almost 50 years) before I could do it. (Only 12 more sleeps.)
"15"" screen and they almost park it on the grass?"
"When the Model Y hits, there may be a good number of 3s traded in. That's what I'm hoping for. Or my $tsla to double again :)"
Keep up the hustle and you will get one soon my friend!
[deleted]
"I love it. When the 3 was announced I bought a blue model s hotwheels off amazon. I kept it my desk at home. 3 years later we got one. It's now my little talisman for luck and persistence. 

You'll get there!!"
"And if the tech keeps going the way it has, the price will be lower and the features even better by the time you buy."
"I‚Äôm 24 and 2 months after I got a job I got my Model 3. Many days it‚Äôs a financial mistake and I will soon regret it. 
It has been 5 months and I‚Äôm hyped knowing every single day I get to wake up and drive this beauty. It drives me to go to work. Do overtime. Look for client to contract my services in the weekend and free time. I know for a fact that if I started saving I would‚Äôve blown the money away elsewhere. Some people just need the incentive to do more. Sometimes it‚Äôs an expensive incentive but nonetheless one that‚Äôs worth it to them. 
Good luck in getting your own. I‚Äôm glad to hear you‚Äôre working extra hard for it. Welcome to the league."
I admire this but please if you can start a retirement savings investment as a priority at your age. Don't miss out on the compound interest growth
"Keep striving, my friend. Dreams are just dreams until you work for them. Then they become goals. Just careful not to sacrifice needs for wants! That‚Äôs sadly why I don‚Äôt have a Model 3 yet. üòÇ

Reppin‚Äô Odd Future I see! I can dig it."
I saved for one and thought a lot before pulling the trigger so that I don‚Äôt stretch too much financially but love the car and the tech in it. Go for it and Godspeed!
"Keep on keeping on!  I've never been a ""car guy"" before owning my 3, but I most definitely am now.  My previous cars were all Civics so nothing mind blowing, but I still took pride in every single one.  I fully believe how you take car of a car says a lot about someone's personality and with how hard you're working towards getting one, I'm confident you'll do exactly that."
Im going in for my 7th day of work this week to do the responsible thing and get some things done around the house before I buy mine. Nothing has motivated me like Tesla. Keep it up!
"Working jobs we hate, buying things we don‚Äôt need. The things you own end up owning you."
"Hats off to you for setting a goal and striving to achieve it. I am rooting for you, good luck."
Love your positivity! Can't wait for the day you take delivery!
In Australia they cost close to $100k. I will need to work 9 jobs and live in a share house before i can afford one.
"If you‚Äôre going to have a dream car - it‚Äôs awesome that it‚Äôs a Tesla. I used to dream of buying an F355 Ferrari & since I got my Tesla, that dream is long gone. First car I‚Äôve had that eliminates the desire to drive anything else. I think you may have to find a way to get a sleeper performance model."
"I really want to discourage you from doing this. It‚Äôs great to be motivated by the things you want. I love cars, I love the Tesla Model 3, but no car is worth stretching yourself financially. Finish college, go get a great job (or even a good job), and you‚Äôll be able to buy a Tesla without it being a burden on you or your family. 

Life is complicated and you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs around the corner. You could end up in a really difficult financial situation, you don‚Äôt want to live in that car. You might get a great job, and buying that car is no big deal. The key is you are very young and the next few years are formative and have a lot of unknowns. If you decide to do it, I wish you the best, but there is a reason most here are telling you think about this a bit more."
My dad got one back in December of last year and it‚Äôs my main goal in life right now
Bro you can't afford a model 3 if you're working two and a half jobs. Get a Leaf or a Volt.
It's an amazing machine. Good luck!
"Good to keep a target and have aspirations. 

Instead of being jealous, being aspirational is better imo. 

But don't just buy a car for the sake of it and also know your limits. Financial limits are very important to gauge to ensure if you have dependents, then they are taken care of."
Excellent way to look at life. I did the same thing üòÅ
Keep up ur hustle! I had to go back to work to have a used Model X. Worth it!
Cool goal but I notice you‚Äôre  in school. You have only one chance in life to finish your schooling with a high gpa. You‚Äôll have a million other chances to purchase a model 3 or even S when you are older and have a stable career job. Don‚Äôt work 2 jobs unless you REALLY need to or are able to ball out in school already.
Am 24 and have just ordered mine 2 weeks ago. Can‚Äôt wait
"Well done and way to set a great example. In case you're worried about missing out while you smartly save toward your goal, don't.  The model 3 will improve by leaps and bounds over the next 2 years.  Range,  power and quality have already risen consistently since the first m3 rolled out and there are numerous technological advances in the works as we speak."
"If you are young take the risk, once you start having responsibilities it will just remain a dream forever."
"I really appreciate that. I‚Äôm pretty young and my family wants to go electric. We‚Äôre setting a goal for ourselves monthly and I‚Äôve even gotten a side job just to make some extra cash, even if it‚Äôs only $100 more a month, anything and everything helps. It really keeps me motivated and I‚Äôve stopped putting things on my car now even though I love it. The Tesla neighbors are new and they look so happy with the car. I just feel like I‚Äôm getting to ahead of myself, but his super clean car keeps me extremely motivated, I can‚Äôt wait!"
"I agree, they aren‚Äôt cheap  and insurance is very expensive with deductibles around $1,000-$2,000 don‚Äôt become car poor. 

Good luck"
"Agreed. Good luck. Keep grinding. My 2 cents are live within your means. I keep trying to tell my kids that. I‚Äôve learned the hard way. If you get one, check out Tesla‚Äôs lease option right now. $0 if you qualify on the model 3s. Great way to not tie up your cash. Plus since tech is changing so fast, you have the car for 3 years, turn it back in and get the latest tech on a new one. No hassles having to sell it or being out of warranty. If any parts (esp the Screen) conk out after the warranty, you‚Äôre looking at a pretty hefty cost. Have to weigh out the after warranty costs and depreciation on the car if you purchase. Just something to consider."
Invest into something like a property that brings income. let that income fuel the purchase of the model 3.
"I have my main job, practically a 9-5, then I have a side job for a start up company which gets me a few hundred more a month, and I also make website as well. That isn‚Äôt including college work either. But seeing that car every morning and every evening keeps me focused. I do it for the future, happier me."
"Oh they certainly struggle to park, why? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"I feel that. My main goal is to wait for this summer to see if there are any test driven cars, because they are typically under 2k miles but they take of $1 for every two miles or something along those lines. So they‚Äôre taken care of dealerships cars, and they‚Äôre a bit cheaper."
"I‚Äôll try my best not to spam post when I get that beauty, I can‚Äôt wait. Thank you so much !"
"Oh my god. You‚Äôve inspired me, that is my next purchase!"
"I really hope so, that why I‚Äôm saving up as much as possible and constantly following the news around tesla and all it‚Äôs cool planned features."
"Thank you so much. I‚Äôm glad to hear that so many people are grinding for it, I can‚Äôt wait to finally finish this grind!"
"This. Old dude stuff but damn looking back now, wish I started investing at your age. 

Regardless, rooting for you to get the 3 soon though. Hate seeing all my entitled lazy coworkers, so love hearing about people like you who appreciate every dollar earned. Good job kid."
"Yessir, love the Wolfgang. This is what I have my eyes set on! Thanks for the kind words :) I wish you the best in your journey!"
"I‚Äôm putting a lot of thought and research, as I have no money and that‚Äôs all I can really do XD. But in all seriousness, this is my next car."
Thank you so much. I love my current car but I have me eyes and focus won‚Äôt on this model 3. Can‚Äôt wait to see the final result of all the makeup I‚Äôll put on her!
Me too! :)
Very true. Hopefully it will be worth it one day.
"Thank you, this will be my first real REAL grind for something I really want. I‚Äôm so excited to keep working toward this!"
Thank you for your reinforcement of positivity! I‚Äôm so excited for the near future!
"Oh wow, I‚Äôm so sorry :( I would assume Australia is pretty environmentally conscience, do they provide any EV incentives?"
Model 3 is $74k for SR+ in Australia.
My first goal is to make her look extremely nice. I‚Äôm think of murdering her out >:)
Thanks for the insight.
I feel that heavy! I wish you the best! We got this!!!
"Oh yeah. 19, not a great idea to buy one."
"I‚Äôm 19, I‚Äôm in college working two jobs, I don‚Äôt get paid much. I‚Äôm not working to 9-5‚Äôs, just jobs that pay for my car, insurance, and save a portion for myself."
"I‚Äôm sure you have good intentions, but....

I own a volt (had it for 6 years) and my next door neighbor a leaf for 7 or 8. PLEASE dont ever recommend a leaf or volt over a model 3!
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠"
"Yeah, I‚Äôm 19 and my parents are helping me, I‚Äôll be fine."
"School isn‚Äôt really hard, I went to a high school that was arguably more difficult than my sophomore year of college taking 3000 level classes to be completely honest. Work is a breeze as it‚Äôs an IT job and it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm good at and my other jobs pay well with minimal work, aka website design. I want to take advantage of not having to pay for rent or anything else apart from my car for that matter to be able to buy myself a graduation present with a little help with my parents. If it‚Äôs not now, I would probably have to wait a decade to get on my feet. That‚Äôs not worth it. I wanna have fun!"
"Absolutely! Either way I‚Äôm always watching bloggers and other Tesla videos so I always feel like I‚Äôm part of the community, even seeing gorgeous posts here on this sub make me feel included and I love the community! Once China gets back on its feet, with the new tesla factory they have there and the unique model they will have, in sure that tech will advance exponentially and that prices will drop pretty handsomely. I can‚Äôt wait!"
"Since my parents are helping me out with rent and things like that, I feel like it‚Äôs the only time I have to take these risks, so the Tesla is the sole thing I‚Äôm focusing on and working for."
This is bad advice.
Do the things that are important to you. You may fail but you'll be better for it. (Source: old guy that I *ahem* know that has failed a LOT!)
"Just save enough where to monthly is low! I worked two jobs to save for mine too, 100% worth it! Goodluck! Stay motivated and stay dedicated to a budget plan!"
"Just keep in mind that you‚Äôre young - there‚Äôs plenty of time to have nice things later once you have built a stable financial foundation

And you can always look at an ID.3 or similar if you miss  your target of the Tesla and want to save the planet."
"Proud of you dog, keep at it, you'll be prospering before you know it üôå"
Get it! Working hard for something is infinitely more rewarding than someone just handing it to you. Good luck friend!
Good luck. Time goes fast. Grab those things that make you happy
"For your reference, here's some info I received when looking at test driven models. This might help with your cost reduction expectations: 

Long Range AWD, Black exterior, Black interior, 18‚Äù wheels. 3,003 miles on the odometer (still new title, previously a test drive vehicle) with a $3,660 price adjustment.

Long Range AWD, Midnight Silver exterior, White interior, 19‚Äù sport wheels. 3,285 miles on the odometer with a $4,100 adjustment."
"So you have an idea . My husband and I financed our car through Tesla (USA bank) we put $13,000 down and our Payments are $630 a month. We bought the dual motor model 3."
You're welcome! I found one on clearance a few months back at Safeway while grocery shopping. I bought it for a friend/coworker who us coveting my Spooky. She has it on her desk at work.
"Thank you, always admire wisdom! This‚Äôll be my graduation gift to myself, after that, I‚Äôm investing in myself!"
Also look at Model Y since it‚Äôs got the same DNA of 3 but with ride dynamics of a SUV. I can foresee some camping potential in Y.
"Unfortunately there aren't any incentives in Australia, in fact these cars are subject to a further tax because they are considered a luxury car. Hopefully at some point they will become a little more affordable here. Good luck getting yours!"
">gaz

Long range (which is the only one i would buy) is $95k. I don't want to buy a car with the minimum range (which is considerably overestimated anyways)."
Thanks! And all the best of luck to you as well!
"You seem like my kind of guy. So, here‚Äôs my 2 cents worth:

Have you heard of Dave Ramsey? Regardless of whether you follow everything he says (or anything for that matter), he has a lot of good money principles to think about.

I don‚Äôt do his envelope method and all that, but a lot of his concepts are very useful. I wish an internet stranger wudda told me about him when i was 19, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm telling you this.

But then again 19 y/o me wouldn‚Äôt have listened to an internet stranger telling me to check out some old fart lecture on how to spend my money...

Good luck to you. Life isn‚Äôt always easy but with the right attitude like yours, you‚Äôll have some fun too ;)

PS I‚Äôm 40 and own a Volt. When I bought it, Tesla only had the S (even the X wasnt out yet). S and X are outside my price range anyway. Y is perfect for me in terms of price and what i need in a vehicle. I‚Äôm saving up to buy a Y in cash - i should get there in about 2 years. Can‚Äôt wait!
(Bought the volt and the family minivan in cash too. Dave ramsey style)"
"Hmm.. you're 19 and working 2.5 partial jobs and aspiring for a Tesla. 

In a way it's good but in a way it's bad. You're likely gonna take on a huge debt when you should be spending money towards good education like getting a Masters in a good field or higher with that money. IMO working hard and getting good education when young (18-23) and getting a good job/career means you can be better off in your 30s and 40s. Flipping to having great life in 20s means you might end up with trouble in 30s/40s. Don't flip the script. Take care of your 20s and mid 30s and then you can enjoy the late 30s/40s/50s and 60s and then beyond

At the end of the day, it's just a car and there are other EV options that aren't as expensive. 

Additionally, your insurance will be very high and you'll be in more debt than worth it. 

Personally, I suggest foregoing the Tesla at this age and focusing on education and hitting a good FTE job and after a few years when you have enough for a good solid home/married needs taken care of and planned for family and expenses determined for then, only then to focus on a Tesla. 

Till then, think of a car as a Point A to Point B vehicle and concentrate on immediate needs and financial future and stability than expensive luxury cars like a Tesla."
"I typically hate to discourage anyone from doing anything they really wanted to do. But at 19 you simply don't have enough driving experience. That's why you always wanted to get a reliable beat up car until you gain enough driving experience as well in a better financial situation. Even if you are good enough not to hit anyone, other people will find its way to hit you. I have to dodge bad drivers on weekly basis. I probably avoided 50+ accidents in my 20+ years of driving. You may say, insurance will take care of it if something happens. That's only half the truth. I am going through insurance process right now, it's a PAIN, especially for Teslas. Insurance has this thing called preferred shop, most Tesla owners don't want to get cars fixed at preferred shop because it's lower quality shops and you don't know what will happen to the car. If you take to the tesla certified shop, they will often quote a lot higher than insurance company willing to pay and they will spend a long time fighting over the cost on fixing the car. Tesla repair time can take anywhere between 2-3 month and sometimes longer. Half of the time just for negotiation and dragging on their feet instead of fixing the car. Ask yourself, can you go without your car for 2-3 months? At 19, your money will be better off invested and earn the return/dividend the market will give you. I would recommend either wait until you get a really good paying job (min 60k+ a year) or at least 30 years old before buying one. There's also used tesla market you can consider to ease your pain a bit when the time comes. Best luck to you."
"k.

I own a 3 and the number of people on here that clearly should not be buying a 3 is insane."
"This is what we need, personal recommendations with absolutely no information at all. Thanks for the contribution. 

I‚Äôve heard the leaf and volt are great vehicles, but according to this guy they aren‚Äôt, just because, so you better not buy one."
"Thank you Tom, really looking forward to the journey, and the Tesla being my end goal. As well as the journey I will have in the Tesla, which the end goal for sure being happiness :)"
Plus tomorrow isn‚Äôt guaranteed. Live for today :)
Appreciate you! Failure makes you better
"Thank you so much, really inspiring to see someone that follows the same path. I‚Äôm more motivated than ever thanks to everyone‚Äôs inspiration!"
"The other side of this coin is that you are only young and free once. Once you buy a house, get married, have children then your expenses and priorities change.

You can work yourself and burn out, and recover when you‚Äôre that age. It gets harder both time wise and health wise.

So work yourself, pay for the car in 5-6 years and keep it. Having a Tesla paid in full when you‚Äôre starting a family or getting a house would be a great reliable car with little maintenance.

It‚Äôs fine to work hard for a car you like, just don‚Äôt chase car after car. That‚Äôs when you lose money flipping cars."
"I really appreciate that, can‚Äôt wait to post all my beauty shots of my tesla, and in the future, the transformation I‚Äôll do to her :)"
Thank you! I know the pay off will be crazy.
"It‚Äôs almost not possible to get much of a discount on floor models. We bought ours in Costa Mesa where they sell like hot cakes and their test models are only reduced by $1,000 and rarely sell. It‚Äôs a crap shoot to buy a floor model. Not impossible but un likely"
"Thank you for the numbers, this is great!"
"Awesome, I‚Äôm defiantly buying the mid-range model because that‚Äôs more feasible with my given budget."
"I‚Äôll go check if my local Toys R‚Äô us has reopened, if they have it anywhere, they should have it there."
"Save first, treat yourself later."
"If you truly admire wisdom, then you should take that above comment to heart and focus on building a solid financial foundation long before you make a frivolous car purchase.  You‚Äôre going about this in exactly the opposite way you should be."
I‚Äôm really looking for a sporty vehicle more. I like sedans and I really wanna make my future model 3 badass!
"Wow that sounds awful, like really awful :( I appreciate the good fortune you send my way and I hope that some day they will recognize Tesla‚Äôs as more environmentally friendly vehicles than just luxury."
"Yea dave Ramsey is a beast!!! I‚Äôm 19 and trying to follow his baby steps. 4k in debt which has no interest while I‚Äôm in school, so that can be paid off easily. I want a model y but I‚Äôm waiting until I can put atleast $30000 down so the payment isn‚Äôt too much. I was going to get it once I get out of college but I told my self that I have to get 1 property before I can get it, or maybe 2. So the cash flow from one of my rentals can pay the monthly payments of my model Y. 

IMO I think buying a tesla now isn‚Äôt a smart decision, but it depends on your goals and how you want your future to look. I plan on being financially independent by 30. So bad debt wouldn‚Äôt help with that"
"I really appreciate this. There‚Äôs always things I wish I could tell my younger self somethings aswell, I really appreciate you telling me this and I will check him out right now!"
"Tesla will be a graduating present, I have parents."
"Idk where you live, but I live in Miami, aka the worst rated commute in the entire US. The drivers here are fucking awful and I drove out of the dealership with a car that had under 20 miles on it. Not a scratch. I‚Äôve avoided countless of accidents with little to no safety features in my car. I don‚Äôt know how a car with more safety features and more doors than the one I currently own will increase my insurance in the slightest. I‚Äôm not going to wait 11 years until I get one, I understand your concern but I just get a hint of jealousy from where you‚Äôre coming from. I‚Äôve been researching this car since before I had ever seen one on the streets here. I have my eyes set on it and I‚Äôm not going to take a shitter car just because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not old enough‚Äù, that‚Äôs kinda BS."
"Actually both the leaf and volt are pretty decent vehicles. I drove my neighbor‚Äôs leaf and he drove my volt many a times. I have no major problem with either of them.

But the model 3 is light years ahead of both of them. In virtually every single aspect of the EV ownership experience. Why recommend someone to take a step back?"
More on this... RUN don‚Äôt walk after your dreams.
"You‚Äôre welcome! 

Yeah don‚Äôt think of it as stretching yourself. That‚Äôs why you just save up a large enough down payment to where the monthly is affordable with everything else. That‚Äôs why we work a second part time, for the fun stuff in life."
Yep!! Happy hunting!
"Woa, TRU is reopening?!?"
"It‚Äôs all good, my entire family is going electric, I can focus on myself once I‚Äôm completely independent."
Nice! üëçüèΩ
"OK. That  helps a lot.

But you should've said this will be a gift and you're a teenager. That is cheating imo ;) it sounded from your post that you were earning your way to it as someone older (I thought you were in your early to mid 30s based on just your title). Being gifted a Tesla is totally different than having an aspiration and working 2.5 jobs to get to it. 

In fact aspiration doesn't mean jack here tbh if you're getting a gift. 

And hopefully your parents can afford it because they need money for their old age. Don't desert them in their time of need."
And the 3 is $35k. A used Leaf can be had for under $10k.
That means so much to me! Thank you u/fuckthatbitch3
"Exactly part-time work, full time fun >:)"
It‚Äôs been!
"Alternatively, you could focus on yourself now, have a healthy down payment for a home and put yourself years ahead of everyone else by delaying the purchase of a rapidly depreciating asset at 19.  Hell, you could travel anywhere you want with that money, and that‚Äôs worth far more than a Tesla, believe me.  Keep your gaze focused on the long term and you‚Äôll be able to buy a Model 3 outright, if you make the right financial choices.  This is not an example of the right financial choices, no matter how exciting it feels."
"They will literally just help me out with the down payment, so they will pay less than $5K. I literally wake up at 8am and get home at 9pm everyday, whether it‚Äôs school or work. I don‚Äôt know why you sound so envious.  Envy, jealousy, and greed is what really makes everyone hate each other. Just because you‚Äôre old and didn‚Äôt get your dream car as a kid doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be a brat and ruin kids dreams. If ruining a 19 year olds day but shitting on his dream car is what you were hoping for, good shit. Hope your kids love you."
"I travel to Europe atleast twice a year, and I eventually want to buy my parents house to live in it with my girlfriend. I‚Äôm working for this car, I‚Äôm not spending any money right now on luxuries or anything unnecessary like I would be doing otherwise. I‚Äôm in no rush to buy a house, and this is the sole thing I‚Äôm saving my money for. It‚Äôs easier me super modding the car I currently have, or saving up for the model 3."
"Why this anger and tantrum reaction post when I haven't actually said anything negative as such?

You said you're aspiring for it with all the jobs and later said you're getting a present which meant your parents were gifting you a Tesla based on your arrogant ""I have parents"". How are people supposed to take that sentence? Everyone has parents but no, most parents don't gift their 19 year old a Tesla. And if they are, your aspirations means nothing. 

Now you're saying they're giving you a $5k max payment. And you've to likely get the rest. Based on this and your young age I'm standing by what I said before 

I'm not at all envious.  I was congratulating you but also advising you based on your age but your story keeps changing key details.

And now this post sums up your immaturity

Anyways whatever. I'm done. And for the record I did get my dream car on my own as my first car at a relatively young age and I'm not that old either."
"Well, you do you mate."
"Then I guess you‚Äôre the only one that can your dream car? Or maybe since you did it all on your own you feel like anyone who gets help is automatically entitled. I didn‚Äôt ask you for your financial advice. Everyone else has been extremely respectful, except for you. You don‚Äôt know me, you don‚Äôt know how I drive, you don‚Äôt know how much money I have. All you do I build straw man arguments about money and driving ability, and tear it down with your weak build up. Go tear down someone‚Äôs else‚Äôs aspiring dreams bud."
holy shit.  Were the people in the RAV4 ok?
Glad to hear your family was safe and hopefully the other families/people were safe.
"I‚Äôm glad everyone is ok. Please make sure you and your family seek medical care if you start exhibiting symptoms of pain/soreness, especially in back and neck. And make sure they report medical treatment to insurance"
Congrats on your new car.
Glad everyone is ok. How long did you have your 3 before this ruined it?
Is the baby okay?
"I was eastbound on I-10 in my 2 mo old M3 and passed your accident site in the massive traffic jam.  I saw the RAV-4 and figured for sure someone was killed.  The news that night reported no fatalities,  thank God.  Its impressive how the passenger compartment of your car resisted deformation.  Best wishes for your families mental health after that experience."
"Good lord. That Nissan was going hell fast to cause that dmg to your car after hitting the rav4!

Glad your family and the rav4 family are in good condition."
"I can see the National news headline already: Tesla in 3 car pile up, why did autopilot fail? 

In all seriousness, I'm really glad you are all okay."
"Wow, glad all were okay. Did you get a picture of the Titan‚Äôs damage by chance?"
I'm glad you and the family are ok.  Both cars were thankfully newer and did a great job absorbing the impact
[deleted]
"So sorry, it happened to your family, glad that you all are safe!"
"Jesus Christ, that‚Äôs horrific. That truck must‚Äôve been flying to crumple the back half of a rav4 and the entire trunk of your car as well. Glad to hear y‚Äôall walked away unscathed."
[deleted]
Oh my goodness! So happy that your family is safe. That looks so frightening.
"That is horrific. Glad your family is Ok.

Does anyone feel that the 7 seat Y option doesn‚Äôt feel safe after seeing this?"
There is some serious incompatibilities with North American pickups and the fleet. IMO There should at least be a strict AEB requirements or special license required to drive a leviathan like a Nissan Titan around.
Wow. Hope everyone is okay.
Glad everyone is safe... that‚Äôs terrifying
Glad everyone was safe
"God damn, glad it sounds like you're ok."
So glad you and your girls are ok!!!!  Hoping it‚Äôs totaled for you it sake! If not that‚Äôs at least six months in the shop
Damm! The damage to the Rav4 is crazy! I am shocked and thankful everyone survived!
"It looks horrific. Glad you and your family are okay. 
The Model 3 has a fantastic crash rating. Glad to see if protected you."
"I‚Äôm so so glad you and your precious family are ok. I cannot imagine how traumatized you were / are. Be safe, everyone."
Glad you and your family are okay. Scary experience!!
Wow. Scary. Happy your family was able to walk away.
Glad everyone is ok. Sorry about your ride
If you're safe that's all that matters.
Glad you and the family are safe!
Do you have a pic of what the back seat looked like? Did it fold in at all?
"Thank God that pillow was there... but seriously, I‚Äôm glad everyone involved was ok, with 2 girls of my own I‚Äôm glad that more and more cars on the road have collision detection and by the time they are driving hopefully the road will be a much safer place."
"I'm so glad everyone's okay. That looks terrible. Everyone may feel fine right now but trust me, I'm a personal injury lawyer, and all my clients say the same thing. I felt fine for several hours and then the adrenaline wore off and I couldn't get out of bed the next day. Do yourself a favor and get yourself checked out. And even if you don't consider yourself ""the type of person who sues somebody,"" the insurance company is not your friend, it is not your good neighbor, it is not there to protect you. They are there to do everything they possibly can to pay you the least amount of money for your property and your health. Hire a lawyer.

Reach out to me privately if you have any questions. I'm happy to answer any questions you may have."
I am glad your family is okay. Also glad the RAV 4 family is okay. Wow just crazy but this really does show how much Teslas in general are very safe
"> I was so scared to turn around and check on my girls fearing the worst.

Uff, reminds me of that gut-wrenching scene in *Hereditary* where the son has a similar reaction to a horrifying incident. Ari Aster has no chill whatsoever.

I'm so sorry you had to go through that."
Let it never be said that Toyota doesn‚Äôt make safe cars.
with any luck that car will be considered to be totalled.
Feels bad men. Every time we see a smashed Tesla it hurts my soul.
"That‚Äôs terrible. Sorry to hear, hope all goes well ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Thank God everyone‚Äôs ok. We were in a terrible, very similar accident about ten years ago. Texting and driving young girl put our beautiful three year old son in the hospital. Thankfully he‚Äôs fine, but if we‚Äôd been in a Tesla, we wouldn‚Äôt have suffered that heartache."
Thankful your children were ok.
"Wow, got hit by a Mercedes a month ago. Not nearly as bad, but it still took me a good half minute until I could think straight again. Glad you are all ok."
WTF! The kid might be going to jail for this. The car looks totalled... I am surprise the front of RAV4 still intact.
"Sometimes I get really tired of people exaggerating the speed they got hit at when I'm doing damage appraisals. ""He hit me going 60!"" And they have a wonky bumper and no damage to the trunk lid. 

That RAV4 is what ""getting hit at 60"" actually looks like.

Makes my back hurt just looking at it."
I‚Äôm glad your family is fine. I hope everyone else is ok.
Holy crap. Glad you‚Äôre okay
"Had your Tesla crashed into the other cars this would have been front page national news. 

Glad everyone is OK!"
"Glad everyone‚Äôs OK.  My monthly Model 3 car payment is hefty, but your post reaffirms that it‚Äôs well worth it.  

All my best to you & your family."
"What drive are you using for your videos? It most accidents seem to cause data loss, and yours didn't."
"DAYAM!!!!

I‚Äôm getting a RAV4. That thing took a massive hit and held up.."
"Serious question:

What happens when a model 3 going 60mph driven by an idiot who‚Äôs, say, texting and driving, hits a stationary model 3. Why does my gut say it‚Äôll be worse than if the cars could both crumble and absorb/dissipate energy in that process.

Full disclosure, i love tesla and i‚Äôm currently saving up to buy a model y so no i‚Äôm not a troll."
"I‚Äôm sorry for your experience. 
Please find a good chiropractor, preferably a low force one, to check you out even if you don‚Äôt feel too beat up. As a spine specialist I cannot tell you how many people get in car accidents, even small ones, and end up developing problems months later. Best of luck."
"man, this makes my fender-bender seem like nothing. I'm glad you guys are ok, but definitely go to like a chiropractor or something and get yourselves checked out. Even after my small accident, I have been in pain starting the next day."
"Yes. They survived. 

After I checked my girls and confirmed we were ok I ran to the RAV. It was awful. Young couple with a 2-3 y.o. child in a car seat. I tried to reach the car seat and get a pulse as the child was just slumped over. I got a pulse and started feeding info to parents because that‚Äôs what I would want to know. They were traumatized to say the least."
That‚Äôs funny. My wife was on Tesla.com hours after the crash. I thought she was nuts but then I realized that we do need a car.
Purchased on 9/25/19.
OP commented elsewhere that everyone was ok. And that the driver that caused the accident was not drunk.

It‚Äôs that darn sudden unintended acceleration again!

"Not Cali but AZ. Airbags did not deploy. I have the cam footage and we downloaded it at the crash site in one of the police cruisers. Officer made a copy and remarked how incredibly helpful the Tesla cams are. Interestingly, the trooper was a Model S owner. 

I‚Äôll upload the videos and provide links."
[here] (https://old.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/f5hf3o/video_footage_tesla_rear_end_collision/) is a link to the footage.
I assume your comment is regarding more of a buffer between rear and passengers. I shudder to think what would have been the outcome had the RAV not been there. I have a Tacoma and sometimes feel that‚Äôs safer or at least in a rear ender like this.
Fair point. Concerning for sure.
I was thinking the same.
[deleted]
"I‚Äôve been thinking along these lines lately. The size difference on the roads is just dangerous. Some people get these giant trucks for work, and I understand that. However, many people buy these huge trucks to be more safe. This creates a situation where people may (notice I said MAY, not throwing everyone in one bucket) not be as concerned about the general safety of those around them. 

No stereotypes, none of that. It‚Äôs all pretty logical to me. We all need to consider the safety of everyone around us. There is a social contract we all have with everyone we are sharing the road with. Unfortunately, there is no easy solution to this. 

MOST IMPORTANTLY:  I‚Äôm glad all parties involved will be OK. This could have been so much worse. Hug your loved ones. Every. Single. Day."
"Special Licensing would reduce it, but humans will always make errors. Lots of truck guys in the states that will get what ever they need and then still drive like asshats."
"Anything can be dangerous in the wrong hands, don't blame the tool blame the idiot driving recklessly."
No way that isn‚Äôt totaled
Lol. AZ Trooper said the pillow and the teddy saved us. We‚Äôre always driving with a pillow moving forward.
"That‚Äôs the main reason I posted this. When I was deliberating the purchase of a Tesla, it was the safety record and stories of people‚Äôs real works experiences that convinced me it was worth the costs."
That'll buff right out

An adult PAX in the backseat would probably have critical injuries based on those pics?
"Automatic Emergency Braking, if left activated (it's on by default), should stop the car."
"> chiropractor

I‚Äôd recommend they go to a real doctor."
"Holy hell. I can‚Äôt even imagine how fast the truck was going to crumple 2 vehicles like an accordion. I am so, so, so thankful your family is OK and the RAV4 riders will survive. Do you know any information about the Titan? Was the guy drunk or was it a medical incident? Were you at a stoplight?"
">Young couple with a 2-3 y.o. child in a car seat. I tried to reach the car seat and get a pulse as the child was just slumped over. I got a pulse and started feeding info to parents because that‚Äôs what I want to know. They were traumatized to say the least.

I'm sure you reduced their trauma measurably. Having someone uninjured there to tell them their Child is alive kept their panic to a minimum.

They were disoriented and would have thought the worst if only for a moment if they could see the damage before being able to check on their child."
You're amazing. Seriously I can't imagine the dread and fear in a parent after a car accident and not knowing if your child is okay or not in the backseat...
Ok good!  Thank you
Remindme! (I cant remember the syntax)
"Jesus, what an irresponsible guy that Titan driver was. No effort to stop whatsoever. I was expecting a sudden slowdown, but this was very gradual. That is so damn scary."
"Pickup are not necessarily safer. Their bigger mass helps but their flat bed doesn‚Äôt offer the level of protection say a Toyota Sequoia (Tundra SUV) would in comparison. But bigger vehicle always wins. 

You helped me decide to get the biggest car I can afford."
There's always lots of these size cars parked outside bars.
That would put Ford and Chevy out of business pretty quick.
Its an arms race on the hwy.  Only the biggest most tank like vehicle can survive.
"To be clear; I did not say he wasn‚Äôt to blame. He is entirely to blame for choosing a vehicle that is more dangerous (to other ppl) and driving it dangerously. However blaming him doesn‚Äôt prevent it happening again all over the US. Preventing people driving these trucks, or making them more compatible with other vehicles could reduce road trauma significantly."
Shout out to the RAV4 safety design as well; very impressive performance given the situation!
"Ok that‚Äôs nice.

For this hypothetical scenario though, i‚Äôm trying to compare severity of similar crashes so let‚Äôs assume that‚Äôs manually turned off. Would the aftermath be worse? (My gut says yes but with no data)"
"Sure, if you need something that doesn‚Äôt require your bones/skeleton to be manipulated (outside of a broken bone) then yes go to a medical doctor. However if you‚Äôre in a car accident and don‚Äôt need dire medical attention but your sore as fuck from whiplash, a chiropractor will and can help."
"The Nissan Titan was being driven by a 23 y.o. We were on the 10 outside Buckeye, AZ. It was one of those situations where traffic slowed from highway speeds to stop and go in a very short distance. He had to have been doing 60mph. He told officers that he looked down and then looked back up and it was all but over. He was not drunk."
"I hope so. I‚Äôll never forget it. 

I approached the RAV and realized how utterly destroyed the vehicle was. I was shocked...I couldn‚Äôt comprehend what I was looking at and I was scared to look inside. I was expecting to see flesh and blood splattered everywhere. 

I didn‚Äôt know what to do...there were no doors or handles or anything to get to the baby. It was just a mangled mess of metal, wires and broken glass. I remember seeing the baby‚Äôs head slumped over with a gash on his head...flesh was hanging from his skull and I thought he was dead. As I reached in, I looked towards the front seats and the mother turned towards me...she was bloodied and completely disoriented. The father the same. They literally did not know what hit them. As soon as I got the pulse I started yelling ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs alive. He‚Äôs alive‚Äù. 

I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep and I can‚Äôt close my eyes because I keep thinking about how my daughter screamed as we got hit. She cried out ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to die papa‚Äù. 

I have showered my wife and daughters with affection at every opportunity. This was a life-changing experience for me.

Thank you all for your support. Reading the comments has made me feel better. Just being able to talk about this has been so therapeutic."

Cybertruck enters the chat
Are you upset at Tesla for soon supplying one of the larger consumer pick up trucks as well?
"Why do you assume that? A Tesla Model 3 weighs at least one ton less than a Nissan Titan. The Tesla also has more crumple zone thanks to the lack of an engine in the front. Both cars would be totaled, and the front end of the striking car would be obliterated, but there'd be less force involved in this case so I am not sure why you expect there to be more damage. Neither Tesla would look like that Rav 4 did."
I think that's still best left to physical therapists.
"""looked down"" aka on his phone right?"
"That‚Äôs so scary. I live just outside DC and see these exact accidents happen all the time in the bad traffic. It can go from highway to stopped quickly and a crash can happen in the blink of an eye. Truly all it takes is 1/2 second of distraction. Add in phones for texting or Spotify controls and then touch screens for cabin controls and it ramps up the chances of an incident. How did the Titan look?

Relieved you all are OK, take it easy the next few days as you may have some aches and pains from the initial jolt."
"As others have stated, I'd LOVE to see his texting history just prior to the crash. I see people all the time gazing down at their phones for way too long while driving on the freeway. Things happen way too fast to be glancing down while driving."
Ugh that freeway. I was just in an accident very near that area. Lots of California commuters and trucks.
"This made me cry. So thankful you are ok, the Rav4 fam, and the Titan boy are all ok. It made me cringe to see what happened to your tesla then I had to look away at the rav4 then thought ""man Tesla... You are a life changer and a life saver."""
"I‚Äôm glad everyone lives. But the kid will be pretty injured; if he was forward facing then head injury. If he was rear facing the leg/hip injury. 

The image of the RAV4 kinda help me make a decision of not buying a smaller car."
"Man I hope that guy goes to jail. While obviously he didn‚Äôt mean to hurt the family, he still did. Gross negligence. Reading the comment and seeing the wreck photos made me sick."
"Where did I say I was upset at anyone except the person driving the truck that very nearly killed a bunch of people?

I think you missed the point that people are more likely to die because trucks have higher bumpers, no or poor AEB, and are heavier than other vehicles.

Since you seem to care what I think:
I think diesel and petroleum emissions make them even worse, and based on that I think any progress toward electric substitution is awesome. But I hope it sets a precedent of exceptional AEB, bumper compatibility and low mass."
"Hi.
First of all, I‚Äôm not arguing with you here. I like to think through best case and worst hypothetical scenarios. Also, I‚Äôm on track to have enough money saved up to buy a model y next year - nothing will change my mind from finally buying a tesla. I just want to make that clear.

So back to my hypothetical scenario. I‚Äôm saying a 60mph model 3 hits a stationary model 3. No titan or rav 4 in the picture. 

And, i‚Äôm only saying assume auto brake manually turned off because i want to make up an imaginary worst case scenario.

Welp. Sounds like my gut feel is wrong which in this case is good for my tesla purchase ;)"
He was checking on his penis
"Not necessarily. It could be adjusting the radio, looking at the time, at the GPS, hell, you eyes drift down because you feel some sort of itch. 

There's a reason why AEB is becoming mandatory."
Yup when i come up on them i leave a butt ton of space and then watch the mirror closely for someone coming up too quick.  then I use my buffer area to buy time for them to stop and also builds my speed up to get to the shoulder if there isn't enough room.
"I know this very well, the DMV is just a nightmare because I am still trying to figure out what areas has worst drivers, so far Maryland in my opinion is winning that. Been here since 2014."
"Same thing happened to me with a 16yo driver because he was changing his radio.  This was pre-cell phones.

Fuckups gonna fuckup."
"I didn't miss any point. I never said you were upset at anyone, I just asked if you were at Tesla. I'm also not defending trucks. Your comment above mine made it sound like you had an issue with trucks (""choosing a vehicle that is more dangerous""), and your original comment called potentially for a special license to drive such large vehicles. Because of those things, I was curious if you were upset at Tesla for releasing what would be one of the biggest trucks available for regular licensed drivers to operate. Was curious on your take, that's all."
"Tesla would be fine. 

Take a look at the IIHS videos of Tesla striking stationary objects. your scenario is actually less severe since both vehicles crumple versus just the one Tesla."
‚ÄúHey little buddy!‚Äù
[deleted]
NOVA born and raised. Maryland is hands down the worst of the worst. If you see them just try to stay out of the way. It‚Äôs also terrifying that there is no recurring MD state inspection for vehicles; some of them are death traps and that combined with a Maryland driver means any encounter is possibly life or death. Scary stuff.
"At highway speeds, looking at the speedometer will have that effect."
"I apologize, I misread your comment. Thanks for clarifying.

Edit: typo"
"To be fair, I often check down there to make sure he‚Äôs ok. He‚Äôs my best friend"
You phrased as a rhetorical question though. So the follow up is fair
"Louisiana drivers could be a contender. Some like to drive super slow, like 45 on the interstate, and some like to drive double the speed limit. Add on a bunch of distracted drivers playing on their phone and it's a recipe for disaster.   

We have annual state inspections but they're not really enforced. I went years without a sticker back in my younger days. Also there are a lot of places you can just buy a sticker without an inspection."
Maryland born and raised. Ever been to Jersey in bad traffic? Even worse.
"It's why we need systems in cars to react when a human can't. There are hundreds of valid reasons for an accident, why chance any of it when we can add sensors to cars that can 100% prevent this. Sure it will take time for the poor to acquire these types of vehicles, but the more out there the more the tech depreciates and the more available to everyone."
No worries! A lot of people on here suck so I don't blame you for assuming I was attacking you or poking holes in your comments.
Yup. All of this could have been prevented if only the guy had a Tesla with autopilot.
The follow up on that guy was indeed fair.
"As someone who has lived and driven in many states, come to Florida. We have the worst of the worst from every state. It's a daily guess of ""What state or country is this terrible driver from?"""
This 100 times. AEB is basically like the seatbelt a while ago.
"So I made sure to Press ‚Äòrecord‚Äô on the screen after the accident so the USB would save the crash. Now when I go to review the videos, I have the moments before and after- but a 60 second segment is missing. Any advice on whether or not it‚Äôs retrievable? Fortunately, there was no issue on fault, but I‚Äôd sure like to get an instant replay on the event-it happened so fast. I‚Äôm just grateful that no one, including the other driver,  was taken off in an ambulance."
"A 92 year old woman was trying to cross four lanes of traffic to get from a subdivision on one side of the road to a subdivision on the other side. She was traveling at a very good clip at a 90 degree angle to me. There was no avoiding it. 
 If I hadn‚Äôt hit her, the woman driving in the lane to my right would have hit her. Thankfully the other driver to the right stayed with me and gave a police report that supported me. The elderly lady had no problems giving up her license, she stated that she knew she should have been ‚Äúdone driving,‚Äù and would not be trying to get her license back. I was literally going down the road, minding my own business, when a car shot out in front of mine, trying to drive across."
Glad you are ok. I work with the elderly and am amazed at how many of my clients have licenses and still drive. Most should not!!
Congrats on the safe outcome. What color combo will you be ordering for your replacement?
"Dang. Sorry, but glad you‚Äôre ok."
Glad all are safe
"Safety before anything. Glad nobody got hurt. 

A car can be fixed or replaced but a life/your health cannot."
Glad to hear you all are ok.
Oof. Good to know that Tesla did not lie about their safety features.
"Geez, what happens now, does tesla give you a temporary replacement till it is fixed or while insurance views it?"
"At the risk of getting downvoted into oblivion, I'd employ a ""second"" dash-cam.  I've always had some kind of wonky issue when I'm in a Model 3 and attempting to use the internal dash-cam.

Personally, I'm world's #1 fan of BlackVue dash-cams, and the 900S-2CH has been an absolute pleasure to deal with."
Glad you and your son are safe. Does anyone know how to safely unmount the flash drive?
Thanks very much
"So good to hear that you guys are safe!

Tesla has saved me and my Dad (and my Dad several times) before, too. 

Also hope they fix the car quickly (if the frame is okay)"
So you‚Äôre not going to make an injury claim I take it.
"I am convinced the all the power is causing a magnetic field pulling cars into Tesla's because they are never at fault. 

(I have studied electronics and yes I'm kidding)"
"As a single mom, so glad that you are both ok. I cannot imagine how scared you both were / are. Be safe, everyone."
Glad he is safe ...That looks horrific
[deleted]
"Are you at fault for the accident though, seems like you rear ended the other driver, but you mention the other driver was ticketed and license taken away- whet exactly happened? I rear ended someone on the freeway after they rear ended the person in front of them, similar damage (though yours is worse) and although to me it absolutely was not my fault since the person in front of me started the chain reaction of crashes, I was credited with fault for the car I hit since I ran into them (I was the last car of 4 cars in the chain that rear ended each other)."
"This tends to happen, for some reason the usb drive disconnects in an accident, preventing recordings. Check out greentheonly's tweets here:

[https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1216457060457631756](https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1216457060457631756)"
"First off I hope everyone is okay.  A car is just a car in the end am I am sure you will back in a new Tesla soon.  

I believe the overall consensus is DONT push record right after the accident, if you can wait a min or 2.

I don‚Äôt know why but if you push the icon right away you lose some video."
"Great news that nobody was injury,

Have you checked the SentryMode files? My M3 has stored my manually saved clips there before"
I just had a accident as well. Never saved the clip I clicked on. Total bummer.
I‚Äôve read a few places that if you have the Mobile Share feature turned on that Tesla may have the accident footage recorded and stored on a server. You may be able to contact support and see if they are able to retrieve those missing 60 seconds for you.
"Unfortunately, this is a common problem. Greentheonly on twitter did some research, and it looks like the G force from the accident knocks the flash drive around a bit causing disruption in the USB connection. A lot of people are reporting this issue. Sorry that you couldn't get the footage readily, but try contacting Tesla. Airbags deployed = footage saved to computer storage & uploaded to Tesla.

Glad to hear everyone is safe :)"
"Did you eject the usb properly before removing it from the car? Theres a known issue if you don‚Äôt do this, the file will get corrupt. It happened to me when I nearly got hit and wanted the video. Next time before you eject the usb, press and hold down the camera icon with the red dot until a white pulse pops up. Then you can remove the drive safely out of the plug.

Glad you and your son are safe! Also happy to see how safe my Tesla is!"
What drive do you use?
I would suggest the SD card route. Generally considered more stable.
"""she stated that she knew she should have been ‚Äúdone driving"".

What a bitch! That's more or less like admitting to be DUI. If you know you shouldn't be driving, don't drive!"
I wish that there were some law in place to annually test the driving ability of anyone over 90!
"My wife and I were just talking about this on the way home tonight as she also works with the elderly and is surprised people get to keep their licenses here (she's not from the USA) when we get so old that we really should have no right to unless we pass some interval of retesting after a certain age. Level 5 driving will end up saving a lot of lives, well actually even the lower levels too, but yeah, ""I'm old!"" isn't an excuse for super dangerous driving, like when I watched an old man driving down the middle turn lane for a mile and was oblivious as to what he was doing; I thought for sure I was about to watch someone die."
Not sure it‚Äôs totaled
Thank you! Me too.
"After seeing the carnage to the car versus the relatively unscathed condition of the passengers, My husband now wants his own Tesla. Smart man."
"I believe we have a $30/day credit on a rental through our insurance- I‚Äôll have to check it out tomorrow. I think the car will have to go to a major city to get fixed, as our local Tesla only handles minor body damage."
Tap and hold the dashcam icon on the upper right of the screen.
Thank you!
Thanks. Hopefully in three years it‚Äôll make him a more aware driver! It was so fast.
"Naw. I‚Äôm just glad she‚Äôs ok and off the road for good. Officer said ‚ÄúThe first thing she said when I approached her car was, ‚ÄòSir, I‚Äôm done. No more driving for me.‚Äô‚Äù She knew it was time. I‚Äôm just grateful she had insurance too."
You're at fault because you were following too closely to stop in time when the shit hit the fan in front of you.
"I did not rear end her. I had the right of way, and she was trying to cut across four lanes at a high rate of speed. Which is why I really wish I had the video!"
"That‚Äôs pretty typical.  you are at fault for being too close to the car in front of you.  if i recall, your insurance pays the guy you hit and the guy that hit you pays for your damage down the chain to the last car that did the hitting that caused the chain.

of course every insurance company will sue the initiator of the chain to recover their funds, but from the POV of the person being hit, if everybody piles on to the one insurance company of the person who initiated the entire chain, it‚Äôs possible they will run out of insurance coverage."
"My guess is that the computer is processing a lot of information during that time, so drops less important and safety critical tasks. Alternately the crash may set off processes that interrupt normal system processes 

Just a guess, and it may be something else entirely: but from a software development point of view, either option (load shedding or interrupts) would make a lot of sense"
Is that like when you accelerate quickly and the phones on the wireless charging pad disconnect?
Fantastic. Thank you for posting these tweets from Green. (I assume he's the well-known Tesla software hacker.)
I definitely got us out of the car first- the pop and Powder from the airbags made me see those ‚ÄúTesla on fire‚Äù videos in my head! So it was a few moments before I pressed it. My mistake was in not holding down the camera button to stop recording it before pulling the USB out- I‚Äôve heard that can mess up the recordings.
"I believe you are right. This same thing happened to me but I just hit an 8 inch piece of concrete at 55 mph. Popped up so quick that I didn't even have a chance to lift my foot off the accelerator. No jarring, just loud noise, no alarms or alerts. Within 30 sec, I pushed the download button. I got home in about 10 min. and pulled my ssd drive off. Sure enough I lost that one minute of hitting the concrete. The minute was missing from both my archive and rolling queue folder. All the minutes before and after were intact and readable. I suspect that pushing the download button impacts the OS to the point that saving the active file fails. I meant to test by trying to hit the button again but without hitting the concrete this time to see if the missing minute us repeatable but have not gotten around to it. Ended up having to replace the battery because the concrete pierced the battery tray which was about 3/8 inch thick aluminum. It pierced a hollow area but the SC would not let me drive it out due to Tesla policy. Insurance took care of it. Took one week for insurance to give the go ahead. One week for SC to order and ship. 3 days to replace battery and check."
"Yes, I tried ‚Äúrecent,‚Äù ‚Äúsentry,‚Äù and ‚Äúsaved‚Äù files,  just in case. Frustrating that it‚Äôs only those 60 seconds missing."
Why why why?! Did the impact knock it silly?  Sigh.
"I‚Äôll try that, thank you!"
"I realized AFTER the fact that I had ejected it improperly. There was a little adrenaline still there after the crash, or I‚Äôd have done it correctly. Well, everyone is safe and fault wasn‚Äôt an issue. I‚Äôll take it any day."
"Yeah, took the hit like a champ, but most damage is in the front corner. Not sure how this will play out."
"Damn, hopefully this doesn‚Äôt happen to us because we live on an island and the closest Tesla centre is in Edinburgh. Hope all works out well though for you"
"The rental should be handled by the other insurance company, not your policy."

I wasn‚Äôt following her. She drove across in front of me while I was obeying the speed limit and minding my own.
Yeah I understand that but I still think the person who caused the initial accident should be responsible for the entire thing.
"That sucks, good thing didnt get hurt and good thing she is off the road going forward!"
"I wasn‚Äôt following her- had I been, this wouldn‚Äôt have happened!"
"I hit an 8 inch rock at 55 mph. No jarring, no alarms or warnings, just a loud noise.  I did press the download button within a minute of hitting the rock. I suspect u are right about the CPU interrupts but wonder if the extral load of asking it to download is creating this issue. I also lost that particular minute of the hit. I looked at both the archive and rolling file folders."
"Hah, I get this too, was wondering if it was just me with poor connections."
"Poor car has a concussion and amnesia. 

Glad you‚Äôre safe!"
This is why I have a second amazon cheapo dash cam! It‚Äôs a definitely set it and forget it deal.
[deleted]
"Happy you are safe. 
Let us know if they totaled it"
"I've been told (I suppose with the right insurance) that even something like hail damage is enough to ""total"" the car. This seems a hell of a lot more significant than hail!"
It‚Äôs totaled.  Air bags deployed?
Thanks!
"Sorry, I was speaking of my son. The female driver of the other vehicle is done driving for good. But perhaps this accident will make my kid more aware how fast things can go wrong!"
"Haha, thankfully I was obeying the speed limit!"
I think Tom's comment was directed at Rebelution.
That sounds like poor connections. Going to test this myself soon :)
"Oh man, this really seems to be a problem! I waited after the accident to press the save button, but the 60 second gap is right where I needed to see what happened. So frustrating. Nix the video games and fix the the cameras!"
Will do!
Yes. So many airbags. I‚Äôm grateful for all of them! Who knew they were down by the feet too?!
I crashed my model 3 and 5 of the airbags deployed and it wasn't totaled. They were actually some of the least expensive part costs - the most expensive single item was the headlight replacement at like $1100.
[deleted]
I had much less damage from a rear end and it‚Äôs over $20k and it‚Äôs has been over two months and I still have no real idea when it will be done - so I hope for your sake it‚Äôs totlaled
This is actually the most compelling reason I bought the car! Did you know its the safest car in north america? I'm not sure about other countries but this is the highest rated car for safety.
Oh damn! Noted!! haha
"Well.... I reckon there‚Äôs a headlight, fancy tire rim, at least four airbags, and a windshield... I‚Äôll find out tomorrow or Wednesday, fingers crossed."
Thanks! Me too!!
"Oh man, I do hope they total it.... though I love my car, it was a really hard hit. Quicker to order another than to wait for repairs at this rate."
Hope they get that jerk hole.
"Good luck ! 

I'm curious what do you seek from finding him? Are you hoping he is paying for the damage or you want him charged with vandalism ? I dunno what would make me satisfied after this sort of incident."
This is the only news story I‚Äôm interested in until he‚Äôs indemnified... pays for the damage... and is charged with vandalism.
"Awesome!  Hope the cops can get him and he can be punished for it, as deserved."
heres hoping they get him!
That's great to hear that this was trending. I hope this guy pays and learns to not mess with people and their cars in general!
Glad to hear your close to getting justice. This one is probably one of the worst vandalism I have seen on a Tesla. True asshole.
Amazing!! The power of the community will prevail against rotten apples!
Thanks for keeping us updated. It is posts like these that reinforce the feeling of community here vs. photos of our cars (which I also enjoy)
Hope you get the guy and please share the rest of the details with us once you do !
good luck!
"Whoever he is, bet he has keyed many other cars over the years. Sentry Mode is finally catch this a-hole."
Glad you posted this here after having it locked once and removed twice on another forum. Can't for the life of me understand why mods would go to such lengths to squash this.
Awesome.  Fuck that dipshit.
Very happy to hear that.  We had a guy back in October key a Tesla in Edmonton and he ended turning himself in so hopefully the police identify him or he turns himself in.
That is awful. I am so sorry. #karma
Good luck.  I hope they get the bastard.
Hope you hunt him down Liam Neeson style and get your street justice.
"I had a backpack stolen with my phone, wallet, AirPods, etc. while I was working out with my buddy at the gym a few weeks ago. We found out who he was because he was sitting in his car in the parking lot (which I ran to the parking lot to make sure he wasn't driving away in my car, I now have PIN to drive enabled for the foreseeable future) and decided to ask me if I was looking for my backpack. It's infuriating to see the person's face who steals or commits any crime against you and having the police not care too much. Hope this guy gets found and you charge him with everything you can. Good luck to you"
Any updates catching this prick?
"Was wondering about this, I'm curious to know how you guys caught him and why he did it when/if you can share it later"
I hope they get him and the cost to him hurts. Assholes like that need to diaf.
Hope they catch the asshole that did this. This needs to be publicized even more so that scumbags like him think twice before doing such things
I hope the news takes the story when you catch him. I have a pre-order for the Cybertruck and I already anticipate the a-holes of the world trying to dent it or break the glass. I hope seeing people being prosecuted disuades people from damaging Teslas.
RemindMe! 1 week
"**What is he facing in California?**

If the damage of the vandalism is under $400, you could face up to one year in a county jail or a fine of up to $1,000, or both. The fine rises to up to $5,000 if it is your second conviction.

**If the damage of the vandalism is over $400, you could face up to one year in a county jail or a fine of up to $10,000** ($50,000 if the damage was more than $10,000) or by both.

&#x200B;

**But more importantly, people that know him will see him as the insecure jerk that go around damaging random people's property.**"
Looks like he got away?

"I hope both!

...for everyone that works their ass off to be able to own something nice o it to have some asshole vandalize it, this guy needs to pay!"
I love it. I hope you finally catch this guy.
so you really want to ruin a mans life over your car being keyed? just let you insurance cover the cost...... thats pathetic
Or any car?
Autocorrect ftl
Jerkl
"It's not like it was an accident. The guy intentionally keyed the car. And there's no way those charges are going to ""ruin his life""."
Redditor for 2 days and all of your comments are on this thread defending keying cars... wouldn't be the least bit surprised if you did the keying.
"If it was an accident maybe, but the keyer made a very conscious choice to be an asshole and damage property belonging to /u/becoolbasf. If they don't like the ramifications of acting that way, they should maybe consider you know... not acting that way!"
"If someone damaged your personal property or items, guarantee you‚Äôd do the same and try to track them down."
This might be the guy! Haha! So much stupid pouring out of you man. Just stop.
So I'm trying to get your logic here So if this clown burned down your house while you were at work or on vacation and you have proof of him setting the fire since insurance covers it you wouldn't press charges? I am starting to think your the one that keyed the car your profile is nothing but commenting on this post. why did you do it man? why because you can\`t afford a nice car ?
This was an intentional act caught on camera damaging someone else‚Äôs prized property. I don‚Äôt blame him for wanting to press charges ‚Äì just the same as you probably would if your house was vandalized.
Criminal damage to property should have a massive negative impact on your life. He‚Äôs an asshole.
"absolutely, I think the fact that you are defending him is pathetic i could understand if he were a child but he is a grown man why should he not be responsible for his very purposeful actions not only once but go back a second time to make sure ?"
"Yea I tried to put a ""/"" between Tesla and cars but it wouldn't work so I just made it a ""( )"" lol"
"Jekyll

Aha. We have his name"
having felony charges on record can def make a difference in a lot of ways in this country.
This is the guy. Only commenting on the 2 posts about this car. He's so scared since he's actually going to get caught. Never thought he'd have to face the consequences.
"nah, I'm not an asshole. In the end your car damage is getting paid for. Now prosecuting a man to the fullest extent? Asshole move."
Hopefully he doesn‚Äôt go and Hyde now.
"When you go out of your way to destroy someone's property, others should know about it"

That will be up to a judge.  Pressing charges just forced accountability.
"Very true, that's why I'm glad they exist."
Found the guy who keyed the car....üëÄ
OP may have to pay a $500 or $1000 deductible for insurance to even begin covering costs. It‚Äôs not a free fix.
You=idiot.
"Let's just let all criminals go because we shouldn't be a bigger asshole to convict them... What fucking logic? There are laws for a reason, and damaging other people property intentionally is against one of those laws."
Do you know that car insurance typically has a $500-$1000 deductible on this kind of damage? This is not ‚Äúno big deal‚Äù for the owner.
"Totally agree. The poor guy only keyed his car and now this asshole is gonna fucking get him in trouble for it. What a douche. Honestly I feel bad for this guy, it‚Äôs just a prank bro, right?"
Damn you.
Cars get keyed all the time. Why do anything if insurance is covering for it? No need to go all these lengths if your problem is already solved. Be a fucking human.

Awesome shot bro!!! Off topic question but my manager lives in Rotterdam as well and says you guys pay a ‚Äúseparate‚Äù road tax on top of tax for the car itself... Is this why your highways and streets are flawless compared to the states?
It‚Äôs quite possible. Do Tesla model 3 owners still wave at each other? üòÄüòÖ
Nog dichterbij! R-hoek / S-hoek
Thank you.
"IMHO it‚Äôs because they enforce laws, are well educated, and shame anyone that litters."
"Thank you. Yes there is a quarterly tax, but electric cars don‚Äôt pay this. My Jeep pays about ‚Ç¨202 every quarter."
The government is also only allowed to use the money gained from the road tax for the roads. It's not put into a general fund.
"I noticed they only did in the beginning but now they don‚Äôt. I would get a sore arm if they did haha, on my commute to schiphol everyday I see around 10 model 3‚Äôs"
I had that on a road that had recently been under construction.
"I had it do that yesterday, and I said ‚Äúno‚Äù and went my way. I regretted it in a minute as the road was also shut down and I had to backtrack. It‚Äôs why we have live updating GPS in cars these days.  :-)"
"I‚Äôve had Waze do this to me. Apparently it saves time in traffic, but instead just pisses off people behind me because it was the same cars I had to cut in front of."
WTF. We were in Napa the other week and it redirected us in the EXACT same spot.
"How can I resolve this? I have the same issue, it takes reroute on when I go towards my home. Even though there is no lane closer or anything else."
Why I often run Waze on my phone at the same time....
FSD is gonna be awesome
Fitting song title
It takes me different routes all the time.   It‚Äôs so convenient to use the Navi on Tesla but so inconvenient when it routes the wrong way!
"Tesla nag likes to ignore many of the legit right and left turns which exist in my city, trying to send me down neighbourhood detours where turning out of them would be near impossible with any reasonable traffic load. Have done some spot checking and they appear to be correctly marked in Open Street Map."
We had this happen on a recent road trip several times. It took us off a different highway exit and had us drive through the city instead. Obv it was pretty slow. I initially thought maybe the closer exit was closed or something but now I think probably not. Probably should have used Google maps instead but part of having it built in on the car is the convenience. And we were heading to a Supercharger in most cases so were low on juice and didn't want to risk getting stuck.
"I like to call it Google intuition

and I also like to think it was avoiding something that would have happened had I driven the obvious route"
"I had a slightly similar issue where it wanted me to drive at least a mile down the road and then somehow turn around and turn right at a turn... luckily I noticed and just turned left, lol."
Is tesla using google routing or their own?
M3‚Äôs are allergic to Ed Sheeran.
Probably some a-hole dragging a wagon full of cell phones around in the street.
I took that same accidental-detour today in my 3!
Google Maps does this to me regularly.
*I found a love....for me....*
*Google maps
"Okay, Michael Scott! ""THE MACHINE KNOWS-- STOP YELLING AT ME!"""
Why they don't allow Google Maps is beyond me...
"The annoying part is the delay. My car lost it's shit with the ""pull a u turn"" to get back on blah blah stuff because of a construction detour and then I think literally the DAY it finally switched to accounting for the detour, the road was back, so now it's STILL freaking out about being off the route."
"It's not always ""live"" though. I've had my car try to take me on a several-hour-long detour because of a road that re-opened weeks ago but wasn't in the map yet. It's often helpful, but not always up-to-date."
"Every time I disobeyed Tesla navigation commands, I have been burned for it"
"I was wondering if this was Napa!

That street was under construction for several months and closed off. So I think all the map apps got used to routing on the detour."
"Yep, Napa. That explains it. I, like a good boy, followed the wild goose chase."
"Since Tesla gets their data from google, reporting a bug in Google Maps or Waze might be the fastest way."
Oh shit.
"Yeah... I've tried to make local changes in regard to speed limits in OSM, but my car still shows 20mph when the limit is actually 35."
It has to be there own because google maps will take me on different routes.
Very wise. I am too despite it playing.
Kekeke
"Man, I was watching myself make the turn in slow motion wondering what the heck I was doing. Total lemming."
"Same with waze, which uses google maps. I‚Äôve shockingly gotten better results with Apple Maps."
It is Google Maps... But it's not Google navigation... Two different things
I thought Tesla licensed mapping from google?  No?
"so yes, I do have that issue to because I'll enter an area that may have been under construction some time ago but the car will start slowing down when I enter that area below with the cruise control set to 4 what would seem like no reason.

But also recently, since the last update, the maps of bendy Haven a little bit differently, even including traffic detail which it doesn't feel like it's truly including traffic data. I do pay for the premium connectivity so I have all that content but it feels like it's not accounting for that anymore so it's keeps telling me to take the shorter route which always has heavier traffic so it takes longer."
"I would suggest checking OSM to see if the route is marked as under construction.

I marked a road by my office under construction and it immediately started routing me around it."
What kind of road would make a detour several hours long? ü§î
Same here.
Hello fellow wine country-ers
I just did the same thing on Saturday lol going from Napa to Sonoma
"No, google and waze both shows correct route. But not Tesla. There must be a way to correct this issues..."
So mine did this today on the nj turnpike but Google maps on my phone just gave me the normal route.  My model 3 tried for an hour or so to get me off the turnpike even saying I no longer had the range to make it to my destination.  I kept driving and it eventually realized it was being dumb and gave up.
"In my case it was California's Pacific Coast Highway through Big Sur. It's effectively a wildlife reserve in many respects and lots of mountains so there aren't many roads through the area. The only detour would require backtracking pretty far out of the way and taking the 101 instead of PCH 1 which is pretty inefficient.

I checked the road closures before my trip so I knew it was open (and Google Maps on my phone showed it open) so I just ignored my car, but if I listened to my car it would be a very boring and inefficient trip."
"It's final destination shit. ""It wants me to go down the deserted mountain path forest access road? Fuck that""

<Keep original route>

An asteroid took out the main route"
Last week I had two equidistant routes to work and it kept flipping between right and left turn once per second.

Do you also put reindeer antlers on your car for Christmas
Uh oh. Make sure you don't run anyone over with your Mardi Gras float.....
Where are the beads?  And where is that?  The road doesn't look bad enough to be New Orleans.
Multicolored glitter mouth!
Mardi Trois!
You don‚Äôt?
"Not my car, but I was further down the parade route when that happened."
"No beads, just a wreath.

This was in the Garden District, near the cemetery.  So about 2 miles from the French Quarter"
"The Christmas wreath on the front is my favorite old rich person thing, I love it. Nothing beats seeing a Mercedes with a wreath on it."
First snow! Lucky you. I have over three feet of snow at the end of my driveway and sheets of ice all over the place. The ice does make driving home fun.
The best part is turning climate control on HI and walking out to a clean warm car.
Now that's a wrap.
North Carolina?
This on a military base? They all seem to build the same style building.
"If road get snowy, put it in chill mod and soft regen. Thank me later"
Did the center camera heater eventually melt the snow?
What model and how did you find it? My last two cars have had four wheel drive so I‚Äôm a little worried about going to a rear wheel drive. I‚Äôm in the UK so we don‚Äôt see to much snow but the four wheel drive has been nice for when we do.
How boring. Wow snow.
"I'm not sure I'd describe driving on ice fun, but to each their own I guess üòÇ"
I came to write this and left satisfied reading it instead
Yup
Come on and raise up
"Nah, not military. This is on my school's campus"
"I honestly didn't know that was a feature; sounds really useful. I didn't need to drive anywhere until after the snow had already melted, so I didn't get to see if that worked or not."
"Teslas don't have four wheel drive.

But my rear wheel drive Model 3 works fine in the snow. I'm used to driving in the snow though. I use the stock tires. It helps that it's a heavier sedan. My old Camaro felt like it was on ice skates."
I have winter tires so on ice it gives just a little before TC kicks in and straightens me out.
"I'm in NC too and got like 5 inches on my Tesla. This morning was torture because I couldn't get the windows to go down when the door was opened/closed, so the drivers for wouldn't close all the way. I had to drive the 7 minutes to work holding the door closed the whole way lol"
School is almost the same as military lol
"Yeah, down here in the south, winter tires are not warranted but also a good way to burn money. 

We might have a 70 degree day, snow the next, and back to 50-70 for a week."
"I'm in NE FLA, and yesterday it was 82, today it is in the 40's but we never get snow or icy roads here and I don't need snows. 

when I lived in snow country snows, especially for RWD cars for me were mandatory. some people get by with the all seasons inplace that don't see much snow.."
Model X all the way
I test drive both and ended up getting the X. The 3 drives smoother but the interior of the X is so much better.
I have both and I love both but they‚Äôre very different. We take the X mostly but the M3P is so fun to drive!
Where was this shot?
"Apples vs oranges, from someone who EATS both!"
What's another 30-60k ;-)
"Definitely try a reboot and also make sure all of your sensors are clean of debris and damage. I had this happen on my Model X for like 2-3 weeks and then it went away on its own. 

Another thing I have noticed is the cameras can fog up sometimes due to humidity and temperature differences in my garage vs the outside environment. That could be the car here too. Not sure, just throwing out some ideas."
Try a reset/reboot [https://tesla-info.com/reboot.php](https://tesla-info.com/reboot.php)
"This. 

Check there is no snow or dirt on sensors."

Nice shot! This angle makes me want one even more.
"man, that looks so good."
Would you mind if I use this photo in my YouTube video?
Looks like the window trim and door handles are blacked out as well. is that standard on the Y instead of the chrome offered on the Model 3?
"Interestingly, looks like a model 3 across the street"
Awesome pictures!
Nope. Double decker bus. I think this also does a good job showing the Model Y wheels without aero covers.
"Looks that way. Definitely not the 18‚Äù Aeros. It had an underlined ‚Äúdual motor‚Äù badge implying performance model, but no red calipers. It also had manufacturers plates. so‚Ä¶ ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Model S actually.

Model 3 and Model Y have the hockey stick doors.  The car across the median has the rectangle bars for door handles"
Also the headlights give it away üò¨
"I was thinking that maybe a truck wasn‚Äôt tall enough for that viewpoint. Good point about the wheels. I hadn‚Äôt seen them without covers.

Toughest wait ever
I want to see more!
I also feel like for my wife and I that this takes care of any doubts we had. So excited to own one one day!!
Looks like a reasonable amount of space. Can‚Äôt wait to get mine!!
Anyone know if it is confirmed to be an automatic trunk open and close or manual like the model 3
"It looks pretty much like the amount of space in my gen 3 Prius hatchback, but perhaps with the deck being a little lower and/or maybe the roofline higher. Plus it will have the subtrunk (and a generous frunk).  This will work quite well.

Edit: After looking at my Prius today, I think the MY is at least several inches longer than my Prius. It‚Äôs a definite increase in storage space."
Nice. Thx for posting
Anyone else wondering if there will be a trunk cover so the stuff in your trunk is not visible?
"This makes me so insanely excited and the wait soooooo much worse. 

This is the storage space I needed. But I hope the 3rd row becomes possible to add on when they do release them next year even if we purchased the 5 seater."
"Yes and since I live in Germany, I will probably have to wait until next year."
"It's auto open confirmed, maybe close too"
"Well, good point, I haven't really thought about it."
Oh bummer. The wait until this summer (assuming) is bad enough. A 1-year wait would be very hard.
"I went ahead and clicked through. Had me log into tesla website and mark days that I was unavailable to take delivery starting March 15 through March 30. I clicked a few I would be out of town and left the rest.

"Did you order a stealth performance or with the ""performance upgrade"" selected? (Wheels, lowered suspension, etc.)

I ordered a stealth in January, also MSM and with FSD, but I have no such email. I wonder if that might be a thing."
"Please ask about ground clearance with and without ""Performance Package"". I ordered mine in March without, cuz I want higher stance, squishier wheels, longer range."
"Woah! I ordered a couple weeks ago, Long Range FSD. Does that mean I can expect mine this early??"
All black interior?
Excellent sign considering you just ordered less than two week ago!
Amazing!!
"Cool. So they're focused on getting the performance Y out first.

Then the LR AWD which would be a lot more orders.

I figure about 50k performance and 100k LR AWD orders."
Let's get some Canada calls coming!
That's awesome!  I'm in OK too.  Preordered the performance day 1 and am already a Tesla owner but no email yet.  üòê
It appeared to just have the March calendar.
according to teslarati it appears it's for orders with the performance upgrade. I pre-ordered MYP without the upgrade the first week of February and dint receive any delivery email either.
"
Long Range All-Wheel Drive Performance
Midnight Silver Metallic Paint

Performance Upgrade
21‚Äô‚Äô √úberturbine Wheels
All Black Premium Interior
Five Seat Interior
Autopilot
Full Self-Driving Capability"
Yes. All black
Any news?
I thought you had inserted the arrow graphic to point out something about the Audi!
I think that‚Äôs the Long Range model because it has the 20‚Äù Induction wheels. The performance typically comes with either the 19‚Äù  Gemini wheels or the 21‚Äù Uberturbine wheels.
With the Induction wheels. Nice. Wish that combo was available.
"Not offering the 20s on the Performance really sucks. Ain't nobody wanna pay for 21"" replacement tires when the time comes...."
"Goddamnit they‚Äôre so hot. Can‚Äôt wait for mine.

Midnight grey; black interior
Induction wheels
LR-AWD
No FSD (I‚Äôll probably have to wait for mine because of this; lower revenue)"
Q5 in front? For size comparison. I currently have a q5. Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a q7.
That's not Performance Model. It's AWD.
Lol. I see what you mean though!
Isn‚Äôt the performance model noted when the Dual Motor & red line underneath it?? That‚Äôs what was on the back.
most of the performance models we‚Äôve seen testing have had the induction wheels. curious that they won‚Äôt let us order em like that...
"Out of curiosity, are you getting the Induction wheels because they look better, or is there another reason?

I'm currently slated for the 19"" Gemini on my LR AWD because I was told it will (slightly) help with the mileage."
"That‚Äôs definitely a Q5, probably a SQ5 to be exact based on wheels and grill design."
Yes it is! It had the Dual Motor + red line below it.
"As noted above, Tesla keeps throwing 20"" Induction wheels on P- testers, just to piss off all of us who want or have ordered the P+, and would prefer those over the 21's."
Ah if that‚Äôs the case then I‚Äôm bummed they‚Äôre not offering that to us! I want that Induction + performance combo more than the 21 Uberturbines which are the ones I got because the performance option online only gives those or the 19‚Äôs which I really don‚Äôt like.
"This is such a miss.  Maybe I feel like so many people want this option only because I am one, but the fact that testers have been out this way for months but we can't order as such is pretty obnoxious."
"I personally think they look better. I do like how the Gemini wheels look without the covers, but I was happy with the induction wheels came out.

It my help to have the Gemini‚Äôs for mileage - as with the Model 3 Aero wheels. For me, I drive very little and will have free charging at work, so I went for it."
Yep that‚Äôs correct! It‚Äôs an SQ5! Interesting comparison to that Audi. It‚Äôs very similar in size.
"it‚Äôs hard to imagine why. i live in the mountains and rolling around on 35series tires isn‚Äôt going to cut it for most of the year. i feel like it‚Äôs odd that ordering the performance upgrade (on the performance model) doesn‚Äôt result in a price change. i don‚Äôt really want the lower ride height (i think) but if i‚Äôm gonna have to buy aftermarket wheels i‚Äôd rather have uberturbines to sell than the ubiquitous gemini‚Äôs. 145 to 155 top speed, couldn‚Äôt care less, carbon fiber spoiler, same, metal pedal covers.. nope. but that 0-60! kinda wonder if there will be a performance OTA rollout that gives the awd a boost like they did with the 3, that would change some thinking here"
"Yeah, when I saw the Y next to other cars, I got the impression the Y will be about the same size as the Q5 or other mid-sized SUVs/crossovers."
When did he put his order in?
What exactly does ‚Äúorientation‚Äù mean? When I bought my 3 they showed me a handful of things and I drove off. Is that what you‚Äôre referring to?
"Thanks for sharing. This is intriguing to say the least! I would love and update when you have one!

I have mine ordered but I am LR and on the east coast so I know I have a bit of a wait but I‚Äôm trying my best to be patient for my pick up date to roll around. 

*adding on"
Orientation? Lol what? I think your friend is feeding you a big pile of....
"Got two calls for learning about solar and demo drive. Maybe thats the orientation?

Anyways don't have time for it."
"Is this something Tesla reached out to him for? Or something he sought out? I ask bc I didn't realize that orientation sessions ahead of the actual delivery day was something they do. Perhaps a model 3 owner can shed some light on this?

Also curious if he has a VIN assigned in his online account?"
Exciting. Please let us know as you learn more.
"Definitely get details, please."
"I ordered today, When do I get my VIN #?"
It's that but in person with real car usually hour or two.  This is done when cars are really new and not many in real world yet.
Sorry you feel that way. Talked to him and it's just them showing Performance reservation the far and letting them drive it. 2 hour event.  Think they did the same for Model 3 when it was about to come out.
Didn't ask him about VIN. I can ask but I'm pretty sure his orientation is in person since he's here in California near the factory. So assuming he had to confirm. I'll ask
I wouldn‚Äôt expect any orders made today to be delivered until the end of the year/early next year.
Probably a year from now =P
Summer
"So he‚Äôs picking up his model Y?!?

That‚Äôs huge news!"
That makes sense. I saw orientation and assumed they made sure you were pointed North when first getting into your new car or something
They can't even pull a Model Y out of the factory without it being breaking news. So it just seemed a bit far fetched he's literally the only person to get a call.
Let us know if he actually gets to drive a Y. That would def be newsworthy.
what about orders made a month ago when they rolled out the $100 non-refundable?
I feel like summer too...but I honestly have nothing to go on but hope üòÇ
Not picking up lol. But I think it's probably to make sure people don't cancel at last minute. Orientation only begins near deliveries.
Someone else here said they got call for solar and demo drive... But ok.
Probably the same. It‚Äôs just speculation on my part at this point of course.
There is more than hope. Emails going out. For model ys delivering in March.
"As a Tesla owner and close follower of Tesla subs, I have never heard of what you‚Äôre describing. Can your friend share a screen shot of the invitation received or something?"
"I ordered two weeks ago. AWD, LR. I received this text today from Portland, OR,  Tesla rep ""...  I wanted to introduce myself and see if you had any questions about your Model Y order. As it stands right now, we anticipate your order to be delivered in about 8-12 months. If that timeline works with your schedule, then that's great. We'll provide more information as the delivery time gets closer. Otherwise, please give me a call and maybe you can start enjoying your Tesla a little bit sooner."""
This is their way of fishing for people who might switch to a M3 for faster delivery. I ordered my car in Aug. and haven‚Äôt gotten contacted by anyone yet.
That is very interesting...
Amazing..
I wonder how many people will gamble on this.  I certainly wouldn't.

Cool hack! üòé
"Wow.   I guess I'm not like ""everyone else"" because I didn't get my e-mail for delivery in March for my Performance Y, White Exterior, Black Interior, FSD.   Kinda a bummer.   Folks that ordered two weeks ago are getting theirs.    Boooooo.   LOL.  

Good luck and I hope it works out for you."
"Sorry to burst your bubble, but I'm going to guessing the dates you have are actually for April and the UI wasn't smart enough to roll it from March to April."
Do you currently own a Tesla?  Just curious if they're prioritizing current owners...
"I‚Äôm sort of in the same situation as you. I really wasn‚Äôt expecting to take delivery until Q3/Q4 2020 (especially since I just preordered on 1/29), so I declared myself as unavailable. I got the same option as you did!  

[My screen recording of the ‚Äúhack‚Äù](https://youtu.be/NOATj-uSf4c)"
Might be a bug...
Same here. Ordered 2 weeks ago but no email yet. Would love to have the car but not ready for it!
"Which state are you in? Did you get the 21"" uberturbine wheels?"
Well then good vibes that mine gets transferred to you for the time being. Exact same order.
Seems like they‚Äôre only delivering black interior Performances for the time being so you would probably be next once they have white interior produced.
Inequality matters
"That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking would happen. To me, it would‚Äôve made more sense for Tesla to put a full calendar out from now until June/July (when the original dates were announced) and then gain logistics on where to send the most cars and when. 

I also think that the calendar is just for logistics on how to plan rollout for delivery. I feel a lot of people will be let down when their MY isn‚Äôt at their house the dates they choose."
We do not.
"Haha! That is awesome! Great thinking to record it too! Hopefully we get more info on it soon. Tesla has to have something in place for this, but then again...it‚Äôs Tesla."
"All for not.   Got the email last night.   St Louis area, Full up performance package with 21‚Äù wheels."
"Well, the good vibes must have worked!!   I ended up getting the email last night.   Maybe your tactic worked and they gave me your order. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Wouldn‚Äôt that be cool!  üëç
Ordered the black interior.   White exterior.
All good.   Expected it with the way the Model 3 rollout went.   I get they have their method to the madness.   I‚Äôll get my car just like everyone else.   Just a matter of time.
Congrats!
"Who Hoo! That‚Äôs great to hear! Never know, that could be exactly what happened. Either way, I‚Äôm glad it worked out for the best!"
"My bad, read your configuration too fast! Hopefully you‚Äôll get notified shortly!"
Thank you!!  I really hope it works out for you and you don‚Äôt lose the order fee.   Good luck sir!!!
No worries!   I appreciate the support.  It‚Äôll happen; just gotta be patient.
I made the order last year when there was the $2500 pre-payment. I would assume that they have some kind of plan for people who pre-ordered when delivery was expected late summer/fall. Guess time will tell!

Thanks for compiling for us. Cheers.
Plz recompile the table so it spells out S3XY. It‚Äôs literally unreadable it in its current state. /s
I wish induction wheel was silver instead of dark color. I preordered the white model Y and think silver wheels goes best with it
"Based on photos and videos I‚Äôve seen, I personally cannot stand the look of the stock Y wheels."
Same thought here. I wish I could get the performance or sport wheels from the 3 on the Y
"Same here. A bit of a shame, as 19"" on the Y has a reasonable sidewall."
Nice summary of what we know so far
Great video!
Perfect.  It answered all my questions.
