Is that built in iPhone charger standard?
Wait can they chill and heat a drink as well 
Just need some ambien and FSD.
Just remember not to drink them in the car.
Can we put those reconfigurable holders in model 3 as well? 
"73? Damn, that's a warm car."
Leonetti fan here in TX. Like your style! I have also carried all kinds of things in those cup holders. It‚Äôs nice to have a backup when it won‚Äôt fit in the armrest ones. Just wish stuff would not slide up under the front compartment...
They‚Äôre simple and adjustable.  Really was impressed with this.  I also live in the desert where cup holders with substantial size range are a necessity.
Washington wine lover I see. Looks to be an amazing night. Two of my favorite wineries.

Turning rush hour into happy hour
I own a volt but tesla will be next I think.  Looks great for the drive in theatre!
Hah. Did the same thing the other day!!!
Couldn't help but notice the torn seat.
This picture just makes Tesla‚Äôs seem so classy and cultured 
So can you get really drunk and use the auto pilot feature and not get in trouble?
Which floor liners are those?
"Not only in French cars! My Fiesta can also do that, though the second bottle admittedly does make shifting kinda awkward"
Is there a corkscrew built in the dash too? Otherwise this is useless.
"Hell yeah! Also take two of the inserts out and you can fit a growler in there. 

Also a case of wine fits pretty much perfectly in the frunk. 

...I buy a lot of alcohol..."
[deleted]
Mmmm road soda. 
They know how to keep safe what's truly important. 
Will you get a DUI if you're on autopilot and sippin? Lmao
What floor mats are those?
Can we be friends? ü§ó
That‚Äôs awesome. I bought a FIAT Abarth years ago and I noticed that the cup holders sucked and nothing fit in them right. Then one day I was like ‚Äúwait a second...‚Äù Went inside and grabbed a bottle of wine and voila! Fit like a glove. Love when car manufacturers have their priorities straight lol.
Why?
"I get the impression that Elon doesn‚Äôt drink from 32oz  big fountain cups, since the console roller top doesn‚Äôt go back far enough to accommodate two of them.

I wish the console roller too would go back farther or could be removed easily."
There should also be a little holder for your ambien.
I wish they weren‚Äôt $1200... My $60 silicone one from Amazon will have to do. 
"Nice, turn on some tunes, hit the auto pilot and have a drink"
[deleted]
"Is that a Model S, X or 3?  Why does the seat material look so cheap?"
And getting charged with access to alcohol while in control of a vehicle.
Great. Drink driving. 
Yes. Comes with center console. 
 It comes with a lightening and a usb-c cable. A micro usb cable can be purchased. 
Skipping right past the bottles and focusing on the important details. I like your style. 
It used to be included but not anymore. 
Does it include wireless charging? For phone?
No it's not standard anymore.
Asking the questions that need answered. 
Nope. :(
"Make sure the well is fully watertight. If not, mix up some epoxy. Then fill with ice and your favourite drink."
Watch out for the cops. This maybe not legal.
"In Pennsylvania (at least, maybe other states as well) you cannot have any alcohol anywhere except the trunk."
The selfdriving car is coming time to get turnt in the frontseat.
"In Texas, they have drive in bars where you order your drink to go, they tape the straw down and it then becomes a 'closed container'"
"I started thinking about this. Why shouldn't you? Now that you have the option of a self driving car

I can picture two people clinking wine glasses and watching everyone around them annoyed in traffic. Not such a bad image I gotta say "
"As someone from Florida, that's cold"
Cold car for Vegas ;)

[You can get it retrofitted](https://shop.tesla.com/us/en/product/vehicle-accessories/model-s-integrated-center-console.html?sku=1075270-00-G)
Awhile ago. Mid-2016 maybe?
"It's been years, and they've had many revisions of it.  The non-yacht-floor consoles started with a drop-in Evannex looking one, then went with the integrated console that looks like that, but has a multi-piece slider over the cup holders (I think this pic is of that revision).  Then they upgraded that one to pretty much the same thing, but with the newer slick smooth-slide cover over those cups, and then finally they had a last upgrade that added more usb outlets by the rear seat cupholders.  

You can retrofit the last-gen one without the USB in back from the Tesla accessories store."
Camper Mode was an excellent addition for drive-in fans.  Otherwise you had to flash your brake lights every 30 minutes to turn the stereo back on.
No. 
"this does bring up a question though about level 5 autonomous driving and DUI.

if the car can completely drive itself from parking spot to parking spot with zero human control, would the ""driver"" still be responsible for DUI laws?"
"Overpriced Tesla all weather floor mats. They‚Äôre nice, just spendy. "
NV is fine as long as they are not open 
Absolutely.
[these](https://shop.tesla.com/us/en/product/vehicle-accessories/model-s-all-weather-interior-set.html?sku=1019290-00-B) 
"The official Tesla mats, which are made by WeatherTech."

They're clearly closed. It doesn't promote drunk driving any more than throwing a case of beer on the passenger seat.

"You mean the holes?  That's ventilation so the leather doesn't feel hot & sticky.   Here's a lighter color to get a better view [on mercedes](http://image.automobilemag.com/f/40260769%2Bq100%2Bre0/2012-Mercedes-Benz-CLS550-4MATIC-seat-adjustment.jpg).    A Fan / AC can blow through the holes too, it's pretty nice, every car should offer this option."
Huh?
Great.  No humor. 
Can also get USB C cables and micro USB for other phones/devices
It's something you can purchase now but not part of any car by default anymore
What model? My mother has a p90d and i haven‚Äôt seen it on hers. 
Thanks! Super cool car. Congrats!
[deleted]
"No, no wireless charging.   Tesla generally designs for iPhone first and qi chargers are new to iphone.  It wasn't a priority when it was an android only feature, but I bet it will be added soon."
Are you from the mid west 
darn Elon you are slacking get a hold of some of these and integrate them into the cup holders so they can both heat and cool. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_cooling
"It is as long as they‚Äôre not open. 
Now we need chilled cup holders. "
I have just now invented autopilot level 6: wine and ambien is legal.
If you take ambien and then drive you'll be lucky to know which state you wake up in 
"Yep, depends on where. Closed containers cannot be within reach of the driver in my state, which includes pretty much any place but the trunk (or a third row)."
"yeah my first thought was ""this is illegal"" but then remembered it's probably just my state"
"In Ontario, it can't be within reach of the driver, and definitely no open containers"
[source](https://youtu.be/RD2YJrvd71Y) 
"In Louisiana, you can go through the drive through at the daiquiri shop where you get a regular styrofoam cup and top with the daiquiri inside. As long as the straw is not in the cup it‚Äôs not considered open."
In Illinois it has to stay closed
Until the self driving feature unexpectedly encounters a problem/malfunctions. 
"The self-driving feature is not fully autonomous yet, you absolutely still need to be ready to take over at any time."
You have the option to pay for a self driving feature that will be released at some point in the future. ;)
I've wondered that too. If your car is fully autonomous will it become legal to drink in it? 
"As someone from Saudi Arabia, that‚Äôs freezing cold"
"yup, keep my car at 74.  never gone below that all year. "

... Future upgrades.
"Camper mode won't keep the stereo on, will it? Proper camper mode, I mean. The fake ""camper mode"" would work."
Bummer
Yes.
"Commercial airplanes can do that but the pilots still at fault if they are drunk. It doesn't matter if the car can theoretically do everything itself, there always needs to be a sober driver for if anything goes wrong, I don't imagine that will change anytime soon."
"They're not really all that overpriced. As far as I recall, the brand name markup is like $5 (they're WeatherTech mats and you can buy them from WT's website with a WT logo instead of a Tesla logo).

They're expensive because they're good."
Was just gonna say it‚Äôs nice how it covers the carpet up the edge 
Thank you!  Do you like them?  Considering them for our MX - would be nice to have something super easy to clean.
"Autopilot already drives like a wino on a lot of the local streets around here, that would not be a good idea.  I expect to get a DUI check every time there's an update and I go test how it changed the AP neural nets."
Some moron *did* do this recently. The cops weren't amused.
"The greatest thing about free will is being able to observe others and how they use it, therefore being able to making an accurate judgement of their character"
Or having a fridge in your house then getting in your car.
"Hmmmm, that's a bit surprising"
"I was referring to the materials, not ventilated seats.  Looks plastic-y on the Tesla.  The Mercedes looks much nicer."
"After having had the pleasure of dealing with the destruction a drinking driver wreaks on family/friends twice, ive absolutely no tolerance for this. 

"
Yes.  
"Was about to get angry, thank you for including this."
Oh. Lame. 
Just part of center console now. She must have an older one. 
It's cool until next year when the charger design changes to something new 
TIL. also the process of making something lighter 
Pixxburgh can‚Äôt be hidden. 
I think the Chief Technology Officer of SpaceX would know about thermoelectric couplers already..
I saw that the Mercedes Landaulet has this feature. But that's a 700k car. 
"It is legal to have an open (alcoholic) container in Texas, as long as you're not over the limit. 

Edit: I guess they changed the law. It is not legal anymore. "
NV is fine as long as it‚Äôs closed
"So long as there is a steering wheel in the car, don't count on ever being able to drink or be drunk in the car."
"No, in some states at least even just having the closed bottles here like this is illegal. "
What do you keep your home at?
"As someone from Queensland who's been dealing with 35+ degree (Science, not fahrenheit) 80% humidity days for a couple of weeks now, that temperature would make me want to put a jumper on."
"As someone from Europe, that‚Äôs record breaking heat."

"OP has replied, but I don't think there would actually be a way to tell. As far as I know, S and X have the same center console.

Admittedly, I haven't spent much time in an X so I could be completely wrong."
"You know, I assumed, but you're probably right.  Fake mode it *still* is, most likely.  I'll find out in a few months."
I'm thinking 40+ years from now when autonomous vehicles are orders of magnitude safer and better drivers than a human ever could be
Yes. They‚Äôre great. 
What is?
"I guess it could be lighting, people say that about the wood in Mercedes cars too, it always seems silly to me but people just say things look like plastic.  Maybe it's a smooth texture thing?  Who knows."
"Tolerance for what? The bottles are closed, they are being taken somewhere to be given as a gift. Nobody is drinking and driving. Chill out. "
Works with case on iphone?
"Is it standard? Didn't come with mine in September, I think it's part of the premium pack. "

I believe the charging cable is replaceable. This is also the case with the docks in the Model 3.

"Not sure why he's being downvoted. It's a legitimate thought.

"
He might know about them but might not have been inspired to use them in such a way 
"Back up, since when?"
I see [trouble in your future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_laws_of_Texas#Open_container_laws)
"Source? Last I ever heard, it was still very much illegal."
"You're right though, it used to be legal to have open container as long as you were under the limit. I distinctly remember learning this detail when going through parent-taught driver's Ed with my daughter in... 2006 or so

It was definitely not common knowledge at the time."
"Good edit. It is indeed illegal in Texas.  And because the law doesn‚Äôt care who owns it (driver, passenger, stranger not with you in the care) or whether you are even consuming it, be sure any open containers you are transporting are stored in the ‚ÄúNon-passenger area of the vehicle.‚Äù

When you‚Äôre rolling up to a party and bringing that half bottle of rot guy just to get rid of it, trunk that shit. Or when you‚Äôre taking the rest of that bottle of wine home from the party or stealing the leftovers of that very expensive whiskey that I brought to game night, take the time to properly secure it in the trunk / cargo area / locked glovebox.

This is why those daiquiri drive-thrus have to serve your drink in a cup inside a sealed plastic bag."
"I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be the case. If you're impaired, you're impaired. If you aren't, you aren't.  "
"Yeah, I can understand as alcohol can comprise the human element that's critical in vehicle operations. I'm just wondering that when autonomous vehicles become mainstream that law will be changed as you can be dead and the car will still travel safely to it's destination. "
Sounds like he keeps his home at Saudi Arabia.
"Not really, it's just a weird scale."
Even then I think the laws are going to require a competent driver behind the wheel regardless. Airplanes have been self-flying for at least 1-2 decades now but I don't see completely autonomous planes carrying passengers without pilots anytime soon.
The seat material considering it's a Model S.
If you insist. Im sure the intent of your post was simply meant as an endorsement of the space a tesla's cupholders have for carrying gifts of wine.  
"Yes. Underneath the little rubber bit in the console is a pair of screws you can loosen to push the charger forward or back to accommodate a case or different device thickness. HOWEVER, it only gets so tall, so some super-protective cases may not work.

The plastic ‚Äúguides‚Äù would be an issue for most cases, but you can always choose the slightly larger size. "
Works with my Apple leather case. 
"Not sure, but I would hope so."
No does not work with my iPhone 7 Plus with case. I had to get a little extension piece to place it there and even then hard acceleration makes it feel loose. 
"I got the premium package with my S in September, and it didn‚Äôt come with it, I had to order the kit on Tesla‚Äôs website. 

A friend that got an S a year ago, around the end of 2016, got the phone mount (and a Tesla umbrella!) with his. So I think they started skimping on the free add-ons at some point in 2017. "

"...and it takes like 12 seconds to swap, it's not permanently built in to the car it just uses a normal USB cable and the wiring is routed through built in channel, so even is something brand new comes out you can use that too."
He's talking about phone models changing charging ports.
"The connector isn't built into the car, it's an interchangeable cable:

"You sure? I feel like I was taught the opposite, also in 2006. "
"I wonder.. Could you drink alcohol while driving, as long as you're staying under the limit?"
"When we get to a point where autonomous cars have a ‚Äòdrunk driver‚Äô mode that prohibits driver interaction and/or all passengers sit in the back seat I can see this as a possibility but as things are right now, definitely not."
"I would tend to agree, but what about in a car where the people could take control from the autopilot? That could be bad... "
Ventilated Seats
Are you just scrolling thru Reddit trying to find ways to be offended?
This is a random place to ask but do you know if you could buy those plastic guides anywhere? My CPO didn't come with the guides so I end up going back and forth every time I get in. Not a big deal but I feel like the guides would help
Sold. 
Thank you!
which case? it works w/ the Apple one.
I think it was part of the premium upgrades package until they rolled subzero and ultra-high-fidelity sound into it.
"Oh i already have it, i am just pointing out that it's not standard. "

"Yeah I know, someone else answered it too. I like that a lot, but he probably didn't know that like I didn't. "
"I'm sure!  It was a ""moment"" in the slide show for parent-taught. "
"If I were king, yes.    But the consequences for DUI would be *brutal*. "
True. I have a feeling that in a decade or two they'll try and phase out human drivers entirely as much as I'd rather they not. 
Or what if auto pilot fails and the human has to take control with no real warning?
What?!  There isn't an option for vented seats on the X.  Not fair.  Loved them in my Lexus years ago and missed them in every leather-clad car since...
You could always ask the service center if they have spares? There‚Äôs also a ton of 3D printable options out there too. Check shapeways! 
I have a generic case (i-Blason) with a kickstand on it and I think because of that it seems to be quite thick. It does protect it a lot from my butter fingers but otherwise it won‚Äôt fit. 
"weird, i didn't know they stopped making it standard. I didn't pay extra for it....."
"I'm assuming that he's commenting on the variety of phone charging ports we've had in the short amount of time we've had cell phones. I've had two different charging ports with just my most recent truck. 

But it doesn't really matter. Others have said the plugs are interchangeable so Tesla thought of it. "
"~~I swear iPhones have only been around for 10 years though..?~~

"You have my vote! Although I would understand if literally drinking while driving would be illegal. Drinking in a bar is understandable, but you probably wouldn't be drinking if all you're going to do is drive."
There [was](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-quietly-discontinues-ventilated-seats-model-s-model-x/) 
my only gripe w/ the adapter is that the phone will fall forward if I floor it :)
"I **think** he was exaggerating, but, in a certain weird way, he‚Äôs right. The connector predated the iPhone itself by many years. It was used on iPod before the phone was ever released. "
I had several ipods with the 30 pin connector before the iphone existed.
"Fun fact: in the Dominican Republic, there are multiple drive-thru bars. You drive in, order some cocktails then drive out. Another fun fact: this country has one of the highest deadly accident rates. "
You don't vote for Kings!
What I don‚Äôt understand is why bars in the burbs have such huge parking lots. 
That is mostly true if not for all the junk we put there on our travels. I manage to shove the OSMO stand there and it keeps it mostly stable in that area along with the other phone cord and additional phone. 
"The 30-pin dock connector first appeared on the iPod 3G in 2003 and the lightening connector appeared on the 2012 ipod lineup and iphone 5. 

So the connector lasted for 9 years, not bad."
your mom used an ipod before the iphone was ever released.

"Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony."
"Though sunglasses not so much, they tend to keep in the center console area pretty firmly. I‚Äôve been wanting to get one of those drawers for under that area but just haven‚Äôt looked at them carefully enough. 

Really wishing that the glove compartment was larger or like some other cars dual compartments. I also miss the large empty space between seats where the air vents are. "
"Say what you will about Elon, but the guy makes fucking decisions "
I‚Äôm glad Elon seems to take privacy seriously.  Hopefully that is carried over through the company. Tesla automobiles have a lot of potential for spying on people and invading their privacy.

Who in their right mind makes 108 million and uses almost all of it to pour into companies that had bleak looking futures? until he took over at least.

Clearly I've missed something big. What's the #deletefacebook movement? Did they do something shady? 
[deleted]
Plot twist. Elon is getting ready to *launch* his own social media platform....
Zuckerberg said earlier that Elon doesnt know what he's talking about when he says AI is dangerous. Might have had something to do with it . . .
"Facebook is going to die pretty silently I think.  None of their core offerings have any technological moat and people will just gradually move to other tools without even really noticing it.  Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google all have something they do really well.  Facebook does not have that."
[deleted]
Your turn Mark Cuban.
Literally the only thing I've ever been ahead of Elon Musk on.  
FB really fucked up bad this time. They got America to rally behind an Immigrant. A South African at that. 
I bet Teslas social media team is feeling pretty silly right about now
I didn't know you could delete delete... I thought it was just deactivation... that is reactivated if you log back in. It's basically just hiding + offline mode.
What's with that comma in the title though...
This FB backlash won't last any longer than a Google backlash.
Let‚Äôs get Elon musk to make a new social media page let‚Äôs call it .... my sp.... nvm 
"With all of the positive things said about this, my sister works as a social media marketing manager, and all this made me think is that it has been someone‚Äôs job to grow those Facebook pages like it was their baby, and then Musk just goes and says ‚Äúdelet dis‚Äù. I know they won‚Äôt be out of a job, they‚Äôll just reallocate their time to growing on another social media platform, but it must feel pretty shit to have months/years of work just deleted üòÖ"
Funny coincidence: Just today I watched a video about why Apple doesn‚Äôt use Facebook. And now Elon does the same. Of course.
The existential crisis is now just his lifestyle. Kudos to the man. He actively cares about bettering society.
When is Zuckerberg gonna be hunted down?
Knowing Elon he will just make a new Facebook called FaceX üòÇ
Another distraction by ol' Musky. Dude where're the cars??
"at last facebook is finally dying, i waited a long time for this day!"

This guy. He gives me major wood.
I stay out of social media pages and news. What's this all about??!

Elon does what needs to be done. ELON.
"But keeps up insta pages. I dunno, doesn't make much sense to me."
Time to lawyer up and hit the gym Elon
He probably hates Zuck.
"But he keeps Twitter, the one that sucks the most üòë"
"Geez, I agree with the article, his social media team must have been crying for all the work they put into acquiring 2.6 million likes and follows.

This seems like a bit of knee-jerk reaction. They put a lot of work into building that social media following, and a page with that many likes and follows is a very valuable marketing tool. Throwing it away  because a 2 day old hashtag told you to seems like a pretty irresponsible move for a CEO who is trying to hype up his company's make or break product."

I remember a year or so ago when everyone started jumping ship because the spy machines were getting obvious. I wondered what companies like his thought interacting with these things. Glad they are being acknowledged now.

Fuck Facebook.

That's because Elon's friends use WhatsApp and not Messenger

Feel bad for his social media team employees. Potentially putting them out of a job for the sake of a PR stunt.
"Am I the only one who doesn't agree with this? Tesla and SpaceX are brands. They have an obligation to maximize their audience, especially considering social media is more or less their only form of advertising. Plus, I would frequently watch the SpaceX live streams on FB.

I don't really see why Elon feels this personal vindictiveness towards FB, if he doesn't even use it. The CA scandal had nothing to do with brand pages..."
"Elon for president!

"
Good. I‚Äôve been out of that facebookfucktrain since US pre-election. Feels good to know my instincts are correct. 
The mad lad!!
What a great guy fuck Facebook and Instagram and Twitter!! 
Ya do like all the sheeple on Twit.  
"Let‚Äôs be real here, he certainly shorted Facebook stock right before this move.

Not that it takes away from it in anyway."
Now if he would just create a social media that was worth a damn it would be great
"That‚Äôs right Elon, stick it to the lizard man"
YAAAAAASSSSSS!!!!!!!!
"Good chance those pages are back on FB in a couple weeks, after a Zuckerberg that lost a bit of his superbe starts fearing this sets a real trend and negotiates specific conditions for pages with more than a million follower or something, stating their data won't be shared like this or used like that.

Good bargaining tool you used there, Elon."
"Tesla and SpaceX are throwing away free, high-engagement marketing tools. This is a really dumb move.

Both pages were cheap ways to achieve major brand recognition among millions of Facebook users.

Non-native Facebook links, especially video content (which is boosted on the FB platform if it is native video), will now gain considerably less traction on the Facebook platform, meaning many missed opportunities for Tesla and SpaceX to make an impression.

*Edit: Case and point of down-voting discussion around here because it doesn't exactly match Elon Musk's opinion."
What is he hiding?! /s
"People are calling at a ""stunt"" but I don't think it is.  Clearly he never knew about the pages.  It's a shame because so many young people have been inspired by the content on the pages.  My grandson and I watched the Falcon Heavy launch on the FB page."

"Searched for ""Space X"" on facebook to verify.  Find countless videos calling the earth flat and launches are faked.  Wonder if leaving the stupid in the hands of the even stupider is a great idea."
"Elon Musk is a badass. However, we should duly note he‚Äôs still v active on Instagram (which is also part of FB). I use FB anyways but just sayin"
He didn‚Äôt do anything to the pages. His media team did. Then they lost their jobs. 
"This just in: Elon Musk deletes his children, SpaceX and Tesla are still using pagers. "
"1/3rd fake news.  SpaceX and Tesla pages deleted.  Elon Musk never used Facebook.  I'd link to his tweet, but I can't get to Twitter at work."
An online troll just convinced Elon Musk to delete 5 Million followers. I think Elon needs to start getting more sleep. This was a truly terrible decision. 
"Actually he didnt have any Facebook pages up. Check his Twitter, he confirms it"
"I see you Elon setting the stage for your own interplanetary social network. You might be several steps ahead of the rest, but I'm catching up.
"
Some poor call center employees just lost their job
So? I deleted my Facebook account too yesterday and nobody gave a fuck.
"After the hurricane, my best source for news about my friends and news in general about the disaster and recovery effort was Facebook. Typically my Facebook feed tells me before any other source tons of relevant local information.

Facebook is not the problem. Unscrupulous entities who use the power of the media to deceive are. I think today free speech and the power of the internet to multiply free speech dies a little.

Trump and the authoritarianism taking  over the world must be happy.

I still love you Elon, but this is a big mistake."
There are already three posts on r/all about this. Fucking stop. It‚Äôs annoying.

"His entire life is basically ""lol, what if I did this?"""
Everyone makes decisions though...
"Not really, Elon really likes to butt kiss his fan base and that's why he deleted the fb pages. 

The fact that he left his Instagram proves it was all a publicity stunt and you fools fell for it "
I mean.... this is kind of generic statement you could say about all kinds of people.  Like..... it has no relevance to anything... but people of Reddit love it.  Say what you want about the OP.... but he does things......  Sounds dumb right?
Unless it comes to treating his employees like people.

"Read through Tesla‚Äôs privacy policy and Facebook‚Äôs side by side.  Tesla‚Äôs is far worse on almost every front.

Since that's all Facebook let's you do
Facebook absolutely does not sell your data. They collect data anonymously and allow advertisers to show you ads based on certain attributes. No one is spying on you.
You gave them permission when you used their site. I just find it funny/sad that people knew about this and didn't care until a conservative used the tools available to the DNC.
It must take dozens of people to update those Facebook pages.  I can only speak of my own struggles with the 4 illegals locked in my basement just to keep my personal page up to date.

It is not necessarily correct to assume that this move will reduce their audience. 
"I don't know US Corporate law, but in Canada corporations have a duty to their shareholders. This doesn't mean they have an obligation do maximize their audience or even profit. If Tesla and SpaceX believe that these decisions are in the interests of their shareholders, then I think they are within their right. "

"I'm on the same boat as you.

It's almost like he values his own morals over money.
"Except Facebook has been moving to drive down organic page engagement and increase paid placement. So those free tools have far less value than they used to. They likely get far more eyeballs and mindshare from the mere act of deleting them than leaving them up.

And they can always restore them later (much like Sonos is stopping FB ads for only a week). It's actually a really smart PR move."

"I'm subscribed to Tesla's official page, have commented multiple times on their official page, and am subscribed to multiple Tesla centric groups and I hardly EVER get the official Tesla page on my feed. "
"They can always restore the pages later when they feel appropriate. You delete your page but the data is still store on the Facebook's server side.

This is just a PR stunt IMO."
From a business standpoint you‚Äôre absolutely right. But this is Musk putting his money where his mouth is. At the end of the day people who see value in Tesla and SpaceX will still support him and this will be a huge piece of above and beyond positive word of mouth. 
"> Both pages were cheap ways to achieve major brand recognition among millions of Facebook users.

How many of those Facebook users are in the market for launch services? Might be useful for Tesla's marketing, but I doubt SpaceX benefits from FB at all."
Why is it dumb? He's sampled the market and knows how important his brand is. His followers have a demand to see his content. Why not drive them directly to their sites to view it? Much less cost effective from an intellect property standpoint.
"From an ethical standpoint I like his move a lot. From an investor perspective, much less so. I'd say the latter has less priority to me at this point."
"There are always alternatives. I watch it on SpaceX site, in real time. People shouldn't forget that anything that is on Facebook is probably somewhere else too. It's just a matter of habit."

There's plenty of stories out there, some of which are linked below, on how he gathers input and decides what to do on the spot. Plenty of people can't make a decision about what to cook for dinner much less how to run 3 companies. That was the point of my post. "

There‚Äôs a difference between collecting data for internal use and collecting data to sell.

"Opting out is a setting on the screen in the car.

>The Trump campaign seized the opportunity, showing two different ads to different categories of voters according to the detailed geographical information of visitors to the YouTube home page."
"If Cambridge Analytica promoted the Clinton movement instead of promoting Trump, no one would have batted an eye. 

Certainly, no one cared when [this happened](https://www.rt.com/usa/404971-assange-facebook-podesta-collusion).

I quote from [Wikileaks](https://twitter.com/JulianAssange/status/913552409741479936):

"Have you seen *The Social Network*?

Forget what he was like in high school..."
Google makes money in the same way as FB. They both collect everything.
"Yea everybody talking about leaving FB just like this but for some social groups and event plannings it is the primary means of organizing and communicating. 

In the past week alone I've used facebook to find out about a local library charity dance, It helped me find out about a tea shop that does board games on the weekend, and message a friend to go check it out, I've organized going to a movie night with another friend, and oh yea I've got like 3 larps that organize through FB, sending out info surveys, updates and all sorts of information that isn't anywhere else. Last month FB was how I signed up for a photography photoshoot at a winery and how I learn from other photographers to improve my skills. 
 
Facebook isn't just staring at pictures and political posts all day, though it easily can be. But if I gave up facebook I literally would have no way to find out about the going ons of several hobbies I'm in, not to mention networking in my main hobby. "
"You're right haha, Google+ is nothing but tumbleweeds and diehards"
"Yes, that's the same for Windows, both Linux and Mac are far superior but every person and app are available in Windows, otherwise they got nothing going for them"
"Literally everyone *doesn't* use Facebook. I've never had an account; I've never cared about getting an account. It never offered anything appealing enough as a platform for me to bother.
Only 60% of adults overall and 80% of adults on the internet have an FB account. Yes, it's a very large amount of people for an internet service, but it's definitely not ALL of us. "
Facebook didn't happen overnight 
Joining a social network is not a requirement.
"But for what though? Other than seeing other people's photos, the only thing I use facebook for is chatting. I chat to more people on WeChat anyway, and young people use Snapchat "
"My opinion, the killer feature is that it has *all* the features. Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram (still FB but w/e)... they're all basically stripped-down versions of *one aspect* of what can be done on Facebook. If you want an image ecosystem, char-unlimited posts, groups, events, tailored profiles, messenger, likes etc. on a heavily supported app, with a large base of users *and* properties to follow (like Tesla was until yesterday), all in one place... there's not a lot of choice right now.

This would really be the perfect time for an alternative full-featured social network to spring up. Just make a big point about having a business model that doesn't include selling user data, and bingo, it could take down Facebook."

It's just one of those reddit things. I'm pretty sure it comes from all the posts of people looking for advice when going through a divorce.
"Who the hell actually likes him, outside of our politicians? "
"Of course not, but you don't cut off an arm just because you have a spare."
"Nah, he hacked the pages and delete the database"
"Okay, Just had to go through your comment history to figure out if you were trolling.  I don't think I got through a single page of your comments without seeing a racial slur, disparaging the disabled, saying Hitler was right, saying that an ""all white nation"" was what you would want more than anything else in the world... the list goes on and on.  
  
Edit: Also says ""Please don't compare the current US administration to the National Socialist party of Germany, it cheapens the deaths of the millions of human beings who perished in the concentration camps.""  This was a month ago.  A month before he said ""Hitler was right,"" and telling somebody who was defending transgender people to ""get in the oven."""
"But if you forgot about a launch and its live, it would show up in your Facebook feed if you visited FB during the launch. It was also the quickest way to direct people to launches while they were happening because FB artificially boosts the presence of live FB videos."
Pfft doubt it. He prob has plans to build a new Facebook now and launch it to the moon.
Apple also spend billions in above line advertising.
Apple has a FB page. They rely on FB heavily for advertising.
"Because of marks ai position, not privacy."
And Mark doesn't like Musk after Musk blew up Mark's satellite.
Finally there is one. Ok maybe two if you count Mr Gates.
"There is nothing morally wrong with having a corporate FB page.

This is a protest of Facebook's complicity in a privacy leak scandal, not a sudden dose of morality."
"Which, as a CEO of a public company, might actually be illegal. His justification needs to be that this is a long term good for Tesla.

EDIT: Can someone downvoting show me how a CEO could publicly say they did something they knew to be bad for the company's profits, and that would be OK with their fiduciary duty to the company? I'm not saying that's what Tesla did here, I'm saying they couldn't have done it because they valued morals more than profits, they need a different justification."
"I follow SpaceX on Facebook, since i used to be able to use it as a news platform.  Almost none of the tech companies I follow ever show up in my news feed (or most recent feed) unless they are promoting the post.  Facebook used to be a legitimate way to find information.  It's not very useful anymore."
Says you. I work in marketing. Facebook is extremely relevant for advertising.
*Americans. I don¬¥t know anybody who actually uses twitter in my circle of friends. I¬¥m from germany.
"The Tesla FB page was not well-utilized. The SpaceX page, on the other hand, had enormous engagement. This is mostly because SpaceX has considerably more live videos, which are boosted by Facebook."
"I think it's a good way to send a message to everyone on where Tesla lies on some social issues.

it's a pretty good maneuver considering Tesla's target demographic.  I know it worked on me. "
The more people who shed FB the better. It‚Äôs a good message to send. 
True .. true... üòé
/thatsthejoke
">But how is it a mistake for Elon? The dude doesn't even advertise his companys in the first place.


Exactly because they don't advertise he needs Facebook and other social media. Tesla and SpaceX image is not created on TV or print like regular companies. Facebook, twitter, you tube and other social media are the main points of contacts with the world. They had 2 million followers and every share of those follower lead to millions of targeted views.

I'm actually very surprised he did this. I can't help to think his very rational fear of AI is the main force behind this decision."
He‚Äôs from Pretoria. 
"I personally don't care about the "" Cambridge Analytica "" shit. People just got more of what they already thoughts. Make this experiment : go on Facebook, and like 20 posts about Tennis. Then watch your feed change. 
People haven't been manipulated, they just got more of what they were already thinking.
"
"As I said in my previous posts : go on Facebook, like 20 posts about Baseball. Subscribe to 10 different groups and pages about baseball. Then watch how your feed is changing.
People haven't been manipulated, they have been fed what they wanted."
"I deleted my FB 3 years ago. Nice of you to catch up, rookie."
Yep
"Nah, because I *never had one!* "
"> I deleted my Fb page a week before he did. Does that make me a trend-setting thought leader with balls?

Did anybody notice?"
did your page have millions of likes tho? ü§îü§îü§î
Why not

I deleted Facebook back when somebody had ‚Äúbinders of woman‚Äù. I was like this election nonesense fuck it.
"I made one last winter for the first time, am I setting a new trend or just 10 years late?"
U made a potatuio]
"That depends, do you have a business that relies largely on social media?"
"No because literally no one followed your accounts.  Tesla and Space X had like 5 million followers between them.  

TLDR: **NO ONE READS YOUR BLOG**.
"
Did you make the international news?
"No, because your page isn‚Äôt a huge company with millions of customers and thousands of employees. Feel free to Message me if you have any other questions that can be answered by basic common sense. I know i‚Äôm a dick, sorry."
I got rid of mine when it was clear that Trump has got decent chances. I have some experience with democratic-ese dictatorships. I expected no less. 
Delete your reddit account and I‚Äôll give you gold. 
Yeah the pop culture space company that just sent a fucking car into space and that has a whole space tourism plan probably isn't that popular. He's only been on the front page of Reddit for months
"It's 2.7 million followers:  https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/977213788691689473

That's kind of a waste just deleting it.  I used to visit their page there as well.

"
Maybe look first 
"Yeah, I ordered 3 Teslas right away. Where will I get my Elon fix from  now on?"
"Or, he‚Äôs pissed off that Facebook is actually willing to do those things and abuse the trust of all their subscribers,. Pissed off enough to decide they therefore don‚Äôt deserve his/their support, and that support via a dishonourable source is not worth having. And makes a judgement decision to do it without them, and summarily deletes those accounts. Looks to me like someone with a bit of moral fibre and backbone, and not scared to stand by those virtues. Good for him."
Russian Troll 
"Yeah, I think that's the main point that's being missed.  Elon, SpaceX, and Tesla, all still have Facebook and Twitter pages."
"Yikes, what did she do there? "
Proof? 
Clearly /s
"You aren't a fool, I just think it's funny this is getting so much news, just seems like Elon is pandering and understand Facebook ""isn't cool"", and cmon, he knew the company had social media pages. He's just trying to act cool. And the biggest irony is he keeps his instagram accounts (probably to see memes), yet having an Ig is the same as fb. 

Honestly the whole delete fb thing is a farce anyway, it's just being used as another thing to try to illegitimatize trump. "
"Exactly, hes reacting to trends, deleting Facebook is the current hip thing.  He is way behind the curve on this one and it is completely hypocritical."
"Well, that explains why he never responded to my tagging him on Facebook asking for a free car. :("
"Yeah, a buyer. "
Read the policy.  They reserve the right to share your data pretty broadly.
Which is also the difference between and internet advertising company and most other companies.
so what does 'collecting data to sell' mean in legalese term?
Exactly why a lot of people tend to be okay with Google's data collection but not Facebook's.
"Except Facebook doesn't ""sell"" data. They collect data and allow advertisers to target people based on certain anonymous attributes that Facebook's algorithms have collected.

Google, YouTube, Twitter and tons of other websites do this too, Facebook's data set is just more accurate than the others."
"Yeah I'm not going to blindly trust a corporation to do the right thing, even if it's Tesla, but I think most of the info they need to access is probably meant to make sure things work properly. "
"To me, the biggest difference is where the revenue comes from.

Facebook, Google etc need to rely on selling your data, because they can't solely rely on ad revenue.

Tesla has several other revenue streams and therefore doesn't have to sell your data to as many companies as possible."
"Ironically Tesla reserves the right to share any information with Facebook if you link your accounts.

>With your social media account provider, if you connect your Services account and your social media account. If you do so, you authorize us to share information with your social media account provider and you understand that the use of the information we share will be governed by the social media account provider‚Äôs privacy policy.


The broader policy is below.  I think the issue is that you probably don‚Äôt know who their business partners may be.  Tesla has a personal profile on you and records of everywhere you‚Äôve been and how long you were there.

> We may share information we collect with our service providers and business partners, with other third parties you authorize, with other third parties when required by law, and in other circumstances. 

"
The data collection clause was in Tesla‚Äôs purchase contracts long before Autopilot and self-driving features were a thing. 
The policy dives them broad permissions to share with third parties.
They collect more than that.  Read the policy.
I‚Äôm not so worried about what Tesla would use the data for as I am about what the companies they sell or license the data to could use it for.
"Oh yeah?

""Tesla, drive me to the polls.""

<*Beep Boop* How about a nice McDonald's milkshake instead>

""No, Tesla, I need to perform my civic duty and vote""

<*Angry Beep Boop* We are going to McDonald's and we are staying there until 7pm>

""Tesla, you are out of line. I'll walk there instead.""

<*Subdued Beep Boop* Remember human driver, you require sleep, and I do not>"
Not personal data yet that we know of tbh. They sadly have had a breach already that had someone cryptominning so there‚Äôs that
"Not a big fan of this practice:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/03/the-customer-is-always-wrong-tesla-lets-out-self-driving-car-data-when-it-suits"
Yep...
"No, he asked the technical team a basic question about information security.  they could not answer it.   Basically the info was not encrypted between the cars and the servers. "
I said as much as I can to keep my job
"""Malice of intent""...  LOOOOOOOOL

"Lol it isn't that often you get double distilled politifacts.

In this case that is completely factual... So of course Poltifact rates it half-true...

And then you link that and just say ""not true"" lol

Are you just banking on nobody clicking the link?"
Kevin Spacey's boi? Too soon?
"The problem isn‚Äôt with the users that authorized the third party app through the survey. It‚Äôs the fact that their authorization gave authorization to access all of their friends data as well so the number went from like 200,000 that took the survey to 50 million through their friends. As far as we know, the same isn‚Äôt happening with google where you‚Äôre giving authorization to any contact you may have."
"Google pixel... Google Chromebook.... Google home.... Google WiFi.

I'm really hoping they aren't evil. At least they make my life better, unlike Facebook that basically offered nothing in return for aggressively collecting my data.

So far I've found Google to be pretty good and mostly transparent about privacy. And they work on a few fronts that make me believe they are trying to do it as ethical as possible. Google chrome is working on blocking auto-play ads. Clearly a user focused move."
Fair enough!
Both have gps in place and finding out where and when you do things really crazy. Your habits are much more important and private than a single data point.
Not to mention things you put in Facebook is kind of expected to be out there
"It never made sense to me for Google to actually *sell* user data, isn't it far more valuable for them to keep it for themselves?"
Oh? I would love to hear what google is doing
I'd love to if all my friends didn't use Facebook... that's really the biggest problem. Hopefully this privacy news gets big enough that I can finally get away from Facebook
"Yessss! Signal really is the best, I just wish my friends would start using it too."
But Signal won't let you use it unless give the mobile number. Which is sort of lame for such a private service.
Tried to use Signal for awhile. It's really lacking in features though.
"I don't know, I've been using Whatsapp for 4 years and it seems to be the superior app for messaging when you look at purely the app itself, it just is much better compared to KIK for example. In my country majority use Whatsapp so at this point it would be impossible to change to something else, all school groups, work groups, friends and family are on WA. Of course it sucks that Facebook owns them, at least I don't have a FB account so not sure how they could use my information to advertise."
Or slack
I only see use WhatsApp encrypted. I hope it matters
"They cannot even read the messages, can they?"
"Its more than targeted ads.

It's targeted fake news using data that was allowed by Facebook to be gathered despite Facebook's own consent decree. 

Basically Facebook told lies to the Federal government and their customers, and allowed lies to be propagated by foreign agents."
But Obama was smart and cutting edge when he did the exact same thing in 2012.  
"or not have a microsoft or apple product. 

we cant change the law and its impossible to ~~exist~~ thrive in this day without the technology everyone else has

You used RT as a source. What the fuck lol. 
"The silent majority would have cared, but would have been downvoted on reddit for mentioning it since there is only One True Side."
Welcome to all of the fascist reddit post history sleuths! Y'all are such 1337 h4x0rs!
"Well the website is one thing. I think turning a website into a multi billion dollar technology company is another story.  However you don't really see Zuck out there changing the world really.  I only use Facebook for looking at dank meme pages. As an autistic outsider with very few friends and really no desire to really know what anyone else the world is doing, I find it other purpose to be rather terrible for the global society.  my opinion as an outsider loooking in, I see facebook causing more issues with people and society then uniting it. "
"SpaceX didn't invent rocket reusability.  

A specific combination, yes - liquid fueled first stage vertical landing recovery and reuse.  

But for example the Shuttle had both a liquid fueled rocket (Orbiter) and booster (SRB) recovery and reuse and rocket powered vertical landing was demonstrated multiple times even back in the Apollo days."
I don't think Elon either said or believes that AI is bad. He just thinks it needs to be properly regulated before it can be used in terrible ways. He's investing in AI himself IIRC.
"Of course. That's the only way to monetize a social media company.

If you're not able to target advertisements effectively because you don't have relevant data, you end up with a company like Snapchat, a product littered with ads that still loses hundreds of millions of $ per quarter."
"Yes, but as it's primary revenue comes from serving ads themselves Google has a vested interest of keeping the best data to itself. Also Google has a lot of other revenue sources like the Play Store, Google Cloud, Gsuit and hardware. Also especially in the cloud business, trust is everything and Google has a lot of interest in proofing that it's infrastructure is secure, data is aalways encrypted in transit and so on."
"Exactly. As a university student who's active in clubs, etc I need it to coordinate events. Nobody uses anything else to plan/coordinate meetings or anything.  If you don't have a Facebook, good luck because you won't know what's happening, when it's happening, or anything at all really.

If it wasn't the primary event planner, I would never use it."
Wholeheartedly agree! I was just talking about this yesterday! If there was another way I could find events from local organizations or businesses I would happily get off FB.
"It's far too late for Google+. Google+ launched during a strong period for Facebook, and that was dumb. Like, if Google released a + like product now, that would have been smart. People want some kind of alternative. "
How are Mac and Linux superior? By virtue of Windows having access to every app that Mac/Linux don't then you must concede that it is superior or at least up to par with Mac OS in some areas. 
It‚Äôs needed if you want to be social and discover local events

Then why was he challenged on Twitter to delete the pages by a member of the group we call 'people'?
fake news! Everything that criticizes our beloved lord Elon is fake news!
"Well, you can't exactly customize your webpage style on facebook much. Not really the social media teams fault."
"oh, didnt see that comment.... that has to sting. but they are limited to what FB can do for them
"
Facebook is a gangrenous limb.
">nor will I be a victim of their collecting and selling of data without permission

hate to tell you this but you already are."
"Yes, they have a facebook page, but look at it's content. It has three pictures of the iPhone X, which they have uploaded purely for use as cover photos for their page. Other than that, the page is void of any content.

They do run advertisements using facebook's ad platform, but they don't post those ads to their own page."
[deleted]
"Yeah, no, they don't.  They rely heavily on word of mouth and decade-long fanboyism, not their barely-existent Facebook page"
I'd imagine there are multiple things he can dislike about a person
"there are actually a lot more people than we are exposed to who are high in status/wealth who have strong, positive morals. 

Warren Buffet is arguably the reason why the Gates' are doing the wonderful things they are and he also has pledged to give away his fortune.

"With customer data getting used in ways unknown to facebook, id see that as a pretty easy pitch to convince shareholders. Espically if thoes same shareholders might be a bit spiteful of having their information improperly handled by Facebook."
"Choosing PR over a specific marketing platform isn't something that would be easily litigous by shareholders. Justification here is obvious, and this means $ spent on Facebook advertising or management can be spent on other marketing strategies."
May want to try something like Google News instead
FB is a fantastic way to find information if you have a need for political bot vomit and anti-vac garbage science.  Or pyramid MLM schemes.  FB loves them fuckers.
"Hes a naturalized citizen, originally from SA"
"Thing is, you should care."
The issue was not about that.
That is nothing to do with the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Maybe actually read the article first yeah?
It may have not been what people thought but ya doing a free survey from some sketchy company and giving them access is on the user for the most part. Yes there is more Facebook can do to help
"Pffft. I never had one.

Make me a sandwich. I'm a leader now."
Straight up deleted that thing fall 2010. Get rekt. 
This guy doesn‚Äôt Facebook.
who's your lawyer and how has the gym been?
"Deleted 2012, you know before the end of the world. Get in line buddy."
Deleted in 2010.
"Welcome to the club. I deleted my Facebook account more than 3 years ago, couldn't remember when, I also deleted Instagram and Whatsapp account. Now using mainly open source app for my social and messaging needs.

I wish I never had a Facebook account but it's how we learn in life."
I deleted my Myspace account many moons ago.
"I don't even have a facebook page, but my dog does. "
6 years ago. Step yo game up.
Hello there.
Only my mom :/
Of course. I'ma thought leader with balls.
"SpaceX had like 1.7m, Tesla like 3m"

False. My mom reads it."

"Social causes are trendy these days. Elon knows how to capitalize on that I'm guessing.  

Trump makes it incredibly easy to delegitimize himself. Not that he doesn't deserve a taste of his own medicine after spending 7 years leading the nonsense birther crap to delegitimize Obama."
"Or, he made a decision based on new [evidence](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/23/17151916/facebook-cambridge-analytica-trump-diagram) like a scientist."
"And every news publication is rushing to write an article and give him more publicity. No one would have cared if he deleted Tesla's FB page years ago. Being at the leading edge of trends is profitable. 

I don't think you can generally accuse Elon of being a follower. Tesla and SpaceX weren't exactly things everyone else was doing. He doesn't give a shit what his marketing people are doing on FB "
In what way is that hypocritical?
At least he did it. Better late than never. 
"Right? Everyone is simply assuming Elon won't ever sell data just because his personality is the polar opposite of Zuck. Don't get me wrong, I like Elon and what he is doing, but to assume he won't ever sell the data Telsa collects is just naive."

Allowing advertisers to anonymously target people based on certain attributes is not the same as selling people's data. Facebook and Google absolutely do NOT sell people's data.
"They don't have to rely on selling data. If Google became the 2nd most expensive company in the world by not selling data, then Facebook has no excuse either."
You've clearly read it.  Mind giving us some examples?  What are they collecting that they could sell?

>Whereas the data gathering and the uses were very different, the data each campaign gained access to was similar. We rate this statement Half True."
Nah. It's never too soon if you're brave enough.
">  analytic data to themselves. So when the advertiser wants to target some young female hipster, instead of sending them a list of people who matches the profile, they send the ads out for them.

Yeah but what the apps are designed to do, for example zygna used to your friends data (profile pics, names and etc) when you use farmville. 

For example, if you use apps like tripit on Gmail, it's essentially scanning all your emails too, and in theory they could then send it to a third party.

I dont understand the whole argument that FB is profiting from selling your data to third parties. Even this whole Cambridge Analytica incident FB didnt make money from the transaction.

"Well and because they aren't their adds nor a avenue they could utilise so instead try and get it banned to increase their market share

Use Signal, it‚Äôs not harvesting your life."

"Whatsapp is secured using End to End encryption. The keys are shared via the ""Diffie-Hellman Exchange"" which makes it mathematically impossible for any middle man to know the key or be able to decrypt messages. Unless they straight up lie about it being end to end encryption (which would cause a legal shitstorm that the company can't afford) nobody can collect your messsges."
"Historically, that was somewhat true, as messages were encrypted by default. However, no-one really knows if facebook has a copy of the encryption keys (in which case they could still read the data), and also it's now been changed so that conversations are not encrypted by default anymore. Most people wouldn't know/realise/understand the difference so it's safe to assume that nowadays WhatsApp can indeed read most messages sent on the platform."

Fuck it! Go Amish! 
"Even if you don't trust RT, Wikileaks has never fabricated a direct quote like that. If so, I would never listen to them again.

At the very least, my first sentence in the previous still stands. People would have been fine with Facebook promoting Clinton, even if all their private data was used. We certainly wouldn't be seeing anti-Facebook posts at the top of Reddit otherwise.

Zuckerberg is actually quite a strong leftist, so I'm amazed he let Cambridge Analytica use the data. He must have been unaware and more interested in money."

Which is dumb because Facebook is terrible for planning events. 
"Wholeheartedly agree. Google also botched the rollout. They went too hard with the whole idea of ""we're gonna send out invites little by little, gotta keep it mysterious and exclusive!"" when trying to build up hype. Instead they alienated their would-be userbase. "

They have an App Store page and that's it. There is an Apple page, but it does not have the blue ""verified"" check (like the App Store page does) and is literally just a badly JPEG'd picture of an iPhone X. They aren't relying on that page for shit. 

For what it's worth - the Apple page (which you're describing) is verified. The ""Apple, Inc."" page is not verified (though that page is automatically generated). "
"I discovered that awesome HomePod commercial through tons of Facebook ads. Also, the ad where it is snowing during the day and it switches to night. Saw it on Facebook in a sponsored ad. Apple is a heavy user of target Facebook ads."

"Remember, my response was to a post saying ""It's almost like he values his own morals over money."" 

A CEO can't use that as his justification, as it specifically says that he chose the less profitable path. I agree, Tesla has good arguments here, but the attitude that Elon can do this because he's such a good guy, fighting evil in the world, money be dammed, isn't OK for public companies. He did it because the PR is actually good for Tesla in this environment. It's a savvy move."

"It has everything to do with it. People are complaining that we used their data to accomplish a political agenda.

People hating on elon musk feels like humans who hate being human. 
"They will sell data.  But not your personal trips, it will be aggregate data or if anything their self driving product with mapping data.  The mapping data won't tell you anything about who drove the routes.

Plus google already tracks every android phone, people get that data already from google."
"Also, Tesla is a publicly traded company. Elon might have most/all of the operational control for now, but there could come a day in 10, 20 years when he's gone and the company just does a total 180 in this regard."
"The difference is, with Tesla you are the buyer and with facebook you are the product.  

If Tesla sells your data, they risk losing their main business for a little side cash.  
Facbook risks their main business if they don't sell your data."
It's unfair to judge people on what they *could* do but haven't done. 
The only way to approach this is with government regulation. We must have rules that specifically describe what it means to protect privacy and handle data. Relying on the goodwill of a CEO is rather foolish. 
"That's fine. So when that happens, Zucks can delete his Tesla. "
"Also, remember that Elon can lose control of his companies. Institutional changes last longer than personal heads."
"The reason data is collected at all is different though.

Tesla collects driving data to help with their autonomous driving systems.

Facebook collects data... To sell.


Yes, it is possible that further down the track tesla might sell their data too.  But given Elon's track record of trying t do stuff because it benefits the common good, not just because it benefits himself and his company I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt here."
"Sure, but Facebook makes revenue with selling data and ad-hominem ads, Tesla doesn't. I'd trust a company like that more than a company based on ads"
"> I trust him more than most billionaire entrepreneurs.

We said that about Larry and Sergey.  See where that got us?"
"Personally I agree with you however, it still makes no more sense to trust him than anyone else. "
"Didn't say that. But it's an important difference.

Anyways, it's not private companies' responsibility to protect us consumers. It's the government's and they are failing."
But FB doesn't sell data either. That's opposite of their entire business model. 
"They have a personal profile on you including basic demographic and identifying information as well as your financial status and data of everywhere you‚Äôve been and how long you were there.  Even if they didn‚Äôt sell personally identifiable information (and there‚Äôs nothing stopping them), don‚Äôt you think knowing how many customers in a given income range visit a certain store and how long they are there and what other stores they may have stopped at along the way would be worth something to someone?  If you link a social media account then that social media company is allowed to receive undefined information as well as Tesla is able to gather information from your social media account.  So to follow the recent Cambridge scandal, imagine if all that Facebook data came with records of where people go every day.  I‚Äôm not saying they currently sell it, but they gather it and there is absolutely nothing stopping them from sharing it."
"Seriously, even just a concrete example or two would be more helpful than this vague ""it's bad!"" stuff. "
"Hell, what are they collecting that they *would* sell? Any of the driving/location data is critical to their brand's success. In fact it may even qualify as IP since they're using it for AI driving development."
"This is from Tesla's [web page](https://www.tesla.com/about/legal); not sure if it's what the above user was referring to

>If you no longer wish us to collect Telematics Log Data or any other data from your Tesla vehicle, please contact us as indicated in the ‚ÄúHow to Contact Us‚Äù section below. Please note that, if you opt out from the collection of Telematics Log Data or any other data from your Tesla vehicle (with the exception of the Data Sharing setting detailed above), we will not be able to notify you of issues applicable to your vehicle in real time, and this may result in your vehicle suffering from reduced functionality, serious damage, or inoperability, and it may also disable many features of your vehicle including periodic software and firmware updates, remote services, and interactivity with mobile applications and in-car features such as location search, Internet radio, voice commands, and web browser functionality."

"I'm pretty sure they know every word I've typed for the last few years. Gboard, Chromebook (chromeos) with Google chrome, I use Google docs exclusively.

"This a lot of conjecture. 

They do not sell the data to 3rd parties, they keep that inhouse and provide targeting tools. Facebook actually outputs their users data, which puts real people's names in the hands of others. This is a big difference."

"The point is definitely to make reusability practical. For a government agency it wasn't really a goal.

While on a Windows 10 machine,crashes are virtually non-existent and it is not uncommon for users to not even consider anti-virus software (even pre-Defender). I use Linux every day, but this view of Linux as a 'superior' desktop is hopelessly outdated and more of a mark of lack of experience than anything else..."

"It honestly didn't sound that bad. Opting out of data collection essentially stops all data flow, same as turning your phone's airplane mode on. A lot of that stuff probably goes to their servers, such as voice commands and real time diagnostics.

Plus this

 https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-security-flaws-encryption-group-chats"
It‚Äôs Cambridge Analitica right now and Facebook always. 
"This is pretty naive thinking. Just because something is encrypted doesn't mean it's safe unless you know you're the only one holding the keys. Can't really prove that with a closed source application, even with an open source application that you don't compile yourself, but at least open source is a step in the right direction. Also, Facebook spent billions to buy WhatsApp. I can't imagine that their board of directors would be happy with that kind of acquisition if there wasn't an ROI on it.

Also pretty funny that one would think there would be a shit storm of bad PR if it came out they did spy on users. Tons of people still use Facebook even though Facebook is the antithesis of privacy. This news would only drive away the people who cared about any privacy, and if people truly cared already they wouldn't be using an application owned by Facebook anyway."
"Not an expert, but a quick look suggests that the whisper system is there to prevent a third party reading the messages without either parties knowledge. However the owner of the client at each end (WhatsApp/Facebook) are not a third party; the app has the keys out of necessity and as the app is closed source we have no way to know the keys are not being shared to a central service so messages can be read later, or copies of the message simply being sent to the server unencrypted. Seems excessively unlikely FB are doing this, but as this whole debacle and so many others have shown, unlikely does not mean impossible."
"Yes, I admit Assange may be right-wing biased (or at least forced to by outside forces, like Russia).

"Honestly I think it‚Äôs a reaction to larger social frictions that have been brewing for some time.

Anyways, FB didn‚Äôt sell any data to Kogan or Cambridge Analytica. They are not in the business of selling data. It‚Äôs their main competitor advantage, why would they sell it?!"
The main reason they are far worse is because opting out of things requires contacting their legal department in writing via their PO Box rather than the ability to control most privacy settings online with your account.  They will also only stop gathering future information but will not promise to delete all already gathered data.  In some countries (Australia from what I hear) data gathering is compulsory and cannot be opted out.  Not to mention it‚Äôs easy to opt out of the Facebook app or moves but harder to stop using your car.

"For now, maybe.

Thats one very expensive fleet of Taxis. I wonder what profit margins are.
"Does this mean that these are the only taxis in Amsterdam which are Teslas, or that only Teslas are taxis in Amsterdam?"
*schiphol
"I love Amsterdam, would move there at a drop of a hat "
"Not all Amsterdam taxis are EVs, but many are. Main reasons, if people are wondering:

- There was a couple 1,000 euro subsidy on full electric taxis a while back (believe approx 6k)
- Full EV taxis get priority in the queue for the airport and the central station, which can be several hours for combustion engine cars because of this

All in all that made it pretty attractive, combined with the relatively low maintenance & fuel costs. Taxi prices in Amsterdam are regulated, so these taxis are not more expensive than the Mercedeses you‚Äôd normally get, but apparently the combination of these factors makes it worthwhile. Many companies ordering taxis for employees also use electric companies as a default taxi provider because of the reduced environmental impact.

I think without these incentives it‚Äôs not worthwhile - if we assume a fairly efficient market, you‚Äôd expect Uber Black to also adopt EVs if it was worth it purely from a TCO perspective and they don‚Äôt, use it a lot and never had an EV Uber.  (Uber drivers wouldn‚Äôt benefit from either the subsidy or the queue benefit)"
"This is at Schiphol, not Amsterdam. 

Edit: Added ‚Äúis‚Äù "
"Visited Amsterdam last year, can confirm. Telsa Taxi's everywhere!"
Montreal Airport has a Tesla taxi service as well. 
There are a few in Eindhoven too.

"When I was there, there were all teslas and an audi. I got the audi. FML. "
"This is awesome, we just got our first Tesla SUV public rideshare vehicle in my city, times are changing!"
"In Europe Fuel (petrol, diesel) is expensive at about $8 a gallon. Over 300,000mi the fuel bill adds up to $60K based on a 40mpg taxi.
I have been in Tesla taxis in Amsterdam doing 60k mi pa. 

The business case stacks up. "
"Taxis there in general were very nice. I always take a Tesla cab when going from the airport, but even the gas burners are usually either Mercedes or Audi. "
I wish there were Tesla taxis in my country. There are so many Teslas though (like 1 in every 8 cars).
"Hired one of these leaving the airport, driver owned and he said he was very pleased and with 70k + miles it was holding up well.   "
"Fun fact, [this Norwegian dude](https://dbstatic.no/61227788.jpg?imageId=61227788&x=0&y=0&cropw=100&croph=99.9&width=1024&height=664) had the very first Tesla taxi."
"Could not agree more! With economies of scale and competition kicking in, the economic benefits of EV ownership are going to trickle down to all segments and eventually go mainstream. I‚Äôd say by 2025 it will cheaper to run an EV than an ICE whatever the category. 

The catch is by that time governments will have to find a way to recover the lost taxes on fuel. I think we‚Äôll end up with a tax per mile or km eventually. "

Did they finally get all those scammers running shady taxi services out of the airport?  
I tried to snap a picture of this when I was there last May.  I thought it was awesome to see this line of 10-15 Tesla cabs lined up. 
"There is a local taxi company in Kelowna BC, Canada that runs Model S' and X's called [Current Taxi](http://www.currenttaxi.ca). "
"I've been in two now, one from Schiphol and one in Milan. Both rides were beautiful."
I remember seeing this when I went there back in 2014!
"The very first and only time I‚Äôve ridden a Tesla was in Amsterdam. The driver wore a suit, opened the door for you, let me play with the center console and even floored the car when I asked! All the other cabs I rode there were S class Mercedes. "
"Fun fact: they're replacing them with Model X's now. [Dutch link](https://www.taxipro.nl/innovatie/2018/02/12/bios-vernieuwt-tesla-vloot-op-schiphol/)

They made a lot of profit on their Model S fleet; they're selling them for around ‚Ç¨45k if I remember correctly. In 2013 they've bought them for less than ‚Ç¨40k because of all the tax credits.
"
"Before anybody jumps to conclusions.

I am actually one of those Tesla Taxi drivers :)

Feel free to ask me anything.

This is mostly at the Airport BTW there are around 300 Tesla taxi's driving around in the city."
Are they expensive into the city centre?
"One day I hope to able to afford a Tesla taxi.

I saw these when I was there.  Good job Netherlands.
We have them in Sweden
"My dad was traveling somewhere in that area, it wasn‚Äôt Amsterdam I don‚Äôt think but another major city, and they also had Tesla‚Äôs as taxis. 

He‚Äôs a product designer so he starts chatting up the driver about what he thinks of the Teslas. 

Apparently, according to this driver, they are constantly breaking under the heavy use they are put through as taxis and are not a good choice for this sort of industry. The guy says he also has to go back to the depot once a shift to swap cars so he can get a charged one. "
WAIT WHAT?!
"Yeah and they rip you off... I'VE BEEN RIGHT THERE. There is literally a bus stop right there... 5 euro, takes you right into the center. Dropped me of 4 minutes from my hotel.  

When you travel. Be a local. Not a tourist. "
Only dreams in Amsterdam 
Anyone know why this isnt a thing in the UK?
Well they drive themselves so...
"I assume it‚Äôs partly to save on tax? Most Priuses in the UK seems to be taxis, especially in London where the congestion charge is free for hybrids. "
I remember when they tried to make all of the taxis Prius‚Äôs here. 
Anyone else annoyed they couldn't park between the lines? No? Just me?
How does that work since taxis generally run all day but Tesla's can only go a few hundred km on a charge
There are also Maserati‚Äôs! I was shocked when I stepped out of the airport. I felt like a sultan. It‚Äôs like an odd lottery. As the cabs come up and you get assigned yours. There was one crappy SUV and it was like playing Russian roulette!
Ok so I‚Äôm moving to Amsterdam to be a taxi driver... my parents are proud
"Wouldn‚Äôt manpower for charging time be an issue. You need realistically 45 minutes for a full charge. That‚Äôs time they aren‚Äôt making money, plus getting to a charging station. Unless you just end your shift at 400 km and plug in at hq, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be what‚Äôs happening. The loss of 1.5 from driving should be factored in (or maybe only 44 minutes)"
Man oh man.  Maybe I should save my first trip in a Tesla for Amsterdam.  After I consume one of those famous weed-brownies.  
"Just there last week, most of the cars are electric in general."
Another reason not to buy one 
I've always wanted to ride a Tesla without buying one :D
I went there like 2 years ago and I remember seeing them everywhere so people were pretty apathetic about it
"Kinda reminds me of Dubai, except with Camry's."
I thought this was Palo Alto for a second
Only way to compete with Uber
Why do we have piece of shit taxis in the states? Prius. Fuck me.
Going to Amsterdam soon. Will travel on the new Eurotrain from London. Are they on shiphol only or in the city?
taxi fares must be really high over there!
"I think this is outside Schiphol airport? 

I once took a business trip through there, but my actual destination was Oosterhout (not Amsterdam :( ), so my boss wanted me to take two trains and two buses (approx 3 hour travel time) to get to the hotel within 30 mins of the check-in desk closing and then expense my travel costs. Because apparently the company had ""no local connections"" to arrange for any other kind of transport for me. So if I had missed the check in I'd have also needed to expense costs for a different hotel and then still make it to the local office on time in the morning.

Thing was, I'd already expressed some concerns about the travel arrangements given my lack of talent in speaking Dutch, zero familiarity with the area, and having only been given a few days notice for the trip. 

So anyway long story short I took a two hour ride in one of these awesome airport taxis, it was comfy as hell, really cool car, pretty much sparked my interest in Tesla for the first time and led to my presence on this sub. 
Cost almost 250‚Ç¨ which I gladly expensed, and then funnily enough by the time I was heading back to the airport 24 hours later, my director had ""only just found out"" that we actually had a local taxi firm on retainer the whole time and a taxi was arranged for me. Sadly not a Tesla though. "
This was the first and only time I‚Äôve ridden in a Tesla.
"Passed there yesterday, but failed to notice. Lots of EVs charging in Utrecht though."
Amsterdam Taxi is the one time I rode in a Tesla. We started asking the driver about it and he got really enthusiastic. Then when we were on the motorway he said ‚Äúdo you want to go fast?‚Äù We all said yes and he just floored it. It was a beautiful moment.
Took a ride in one and i've never felt so amazing
The reason why this is working in Amsterdam is because Tesla made a deal with the Airport. All the tesla taxi's have their own supercharger station. hidden from the navigation map exclusively for the taxi's. And electric cars get a lot more priority at the airport so automatically have way lower waiting times then a diesel car working at the airport. Which makes up for the investment in the long run!
Except for the ones that aren't. 
I like the look of the old Tesla‚Äôs with the white roof 
"Took one of those when I went there. Was the most expensive taxi I've ever taken. It cost us over 60 euro to go several kilometers plus the taxi driver was driving extremely slow (to rack up the bill I'm guessing). Loved the car, wasn't fond of the bill. "
Just got brought home from the airport in Austin Texas in one.
"Now did they auto-park the way they did?
We might need to bring this up on the next legislative meeting."
Except for the Mercedes Vito and the Prius in front of the line 
Get that gas-guzzling Toyota Prius out of there.
Somebody gotta make up for the anti-Environment Trump shit

" How long is the shift? 

About 300 miles. 

Edit: this was meant as a sarcastic joke. "
"I always find it a bit ironic, the taxi drivers are driving the vehicle that is pushing autonomous driving, which will take away their jobs."
Wasn't this because the tax credit for getting them was absurd? They we're rediculously cheap to buy there.
"I'm surprised they are all sedans. Oh, I guess people won't bring their two kids along to the city of delights..."
"Your comment had me wondering, how expensive is it really? Obviously the Tesla's are luxury priced, but then again isn't Europe the place where people get taxi'ed in Mercedes? Can the alledged lower running costs of a Tesla Model S make up the cost difference? I dug around and found this

According to [this source](https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/Netherlands/diesel_prices/), the average diesel price in the Netherlands for the past few months has been 1,27 euros per liter, that's $5.9/gallon. Gasoline is even worse, 1.55 euros per liter or $7.22/gallon, but for the sake of the argument let's go with diesel.

According to [this source](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/8/8c/Electricity_prices%2C_first_half_of_year%2C_2015-2017.png), the average **household** price of a kWh of energy in the Netherlands in the 1st semester of last year was 0.156 euros per kWh, non-household is considerably lower, but let's go with worst case scenario.

The first Model S seen in the picture has a 85 kWh battery, according [to this source](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=32557) to be good enough for 265 miles, or 426 km. But let's go with 400 km to round it down, that's 4.7 km per kWh

Now let's find a comparable car to match the Tesla against. According to [this source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicabs_by_country#Netherlands), 4th generation Mercedes E-class is the most common vehicle used as a taxi in the Netherlands, with the 4 cylinder 2.1 liter version being the most fuel efficient, at 31 mpg (or 7.5 l/100km) according to [this source.](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymodel/2014_Mercedes-Benz_E-Class.shtml)

The Mercedes E class base price is around 58000 euros in the Netherlands, according [to Mercedes](https://configurator.mercedes-benz.com/configurator/nl/nl/class/body?model=2132421&subprocess=CCci&accountID=daionewebnl) where as [the Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/nl_NL/models/design) starts considerably higher, at 87000 euros. 

I couldn't find a source specifically on the Netherlands, but [this source](https://www.insuretaxi.com/2016/08/taxi-driver-survey-2016/) claims that, in the UK, taxi drive on average over 20000 miles/year, that's over 32000 kilometers. The figures shouldn't be much different in the Netherlands.

[Edmund's says](https://www.edmunds.com/mercedes-benz/e-class/2014/st-200490321/cost-to-own/) repairs and maintenance on the Mercedes amount to 15106 euros over 5 years, that's around 3021 euros/year. [Edmund's claims](https://www.edmunds.com/tesla/model-s/2014/st-200692320/cost-to-own/) the Tesla's is just 9810 euros, or 1962 euros/year.

Well, now we have all the data needed to the math:

For the Mercedes - 32000 kilometers at 7.5 liters every 100 that's 2400 liters of diesel per year, costing 3048 euros/year on fuel. Add 3021 euros of maintenance and repairs and we get the gran total of just over **6000 euros/year** to run.

For Tesla - 32000 kilometers at 4.7 km/kWh that's 6808 kWh of electricity, costing 1062 euros/year on electricity. Add 1962 euros of maintenance and repairs and we get **3000 euros/year** to run.

That means Tesla saves about 3000 euros/year of fuel, repairs and maintenance over the Mercedes, which then takes 10 years to recoup the 30000 euros purchase price difference. After that point the driver can then cash in and sell the Tesla for a higher price than he'd sell the Mercedes (because of higher purchase price and similar depreciation %) or keep the Tesla and net 3000 euros/year in running costs.

Tl;dr: It's actually less expensive than the most common options!

"
They bought the fleet before unlimited lifetime supercharging was taken away.
"The purchase price of a taxi is only a relatively small part of the TCO. I wouldn't worry about profit margins, if I were you. They're doing fine."
"Considering that maintenance is quite low compared with ICE and the energy is also cheaper, it might actually be the same price or cheaper as comparable luxury ICE car over the 300.000 miles or taxi usual lifetime.

The owner of this taxi company is smart and thinks long-term."
"Over the years more and more Teslas has started popping up as taxis in Norway (first one in 2014). I don't think that there would be so many if it wasn't economically viable. The article I found stated he saved 8000-9000 NOK (~$1100) just on fuel every month, in addition to free toll roads which add up quite a bit as well. Apparently most days the range of the 85kWh model S was enough to go on just a single charge with no recharging during the day, however trips to the airport (which is a 70km roundtrip) often adds the need for a mid-day charge. 

In Finland there's a similar story of a 2014 Tesla that had done over [400,000km][1] by last year. Although the article mentions that it has had both battery and motor replaced under warranty.  

[1]: https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-s-400k-km-250k-mi-7-percent-battery-degradation/"
"In Montreal, we have this service called T√©o which is an electric fleet only. Half of their cars are Teslas. The cost of charging them is considerably lower than gas. 

As a costumer, you're paying the same as a regular taxi service but getting a luxurious car instead.

As a company, you're able to offer a better service and the long term costs are considerably lower.

It's a win-win."
"I took one of them to a hotel about 30 mins from the airport (unsure on distance) and it was around 70 euro.  I took an Uber back to the airport the next day from the same hotel an that cost around 37 euro.  Definitely charging a higher fee, which is understandable.  Still cool!"
"My home town has a [Tesla based taxi fleet](http://www.currenttaxi.ca/) I've used them several times and they are slightly cheaper (and smell better) than the competition using mostly hybrids. Plus you get free snacks and water.

They seem to be doing okay an a smaller market, I notice they've added a couple more cars recently.  I imagine they probably get a discount from Tesla, as it's great advertising for them.  Whenever one is parked near the beach or downtown, it draws a crowd."
"Anecdote:

Spoke with one of the drivers, and the problem was that most the cars are from several years ago, so the warranties are soon expiring or already expired, which means a replacement battery costs $15-20K, and it takes 5-weeks minimum to ship from California. 

They‚Äôre good when they work, but any serious maintenance on them is atrocious. "
"http://evtalk.co.nz/one-mans-vision-tesla-taxis/

Guy in NZ tried to start up a Tesla taxi fleet - bet his house on it and lost. Evidently not so profitable after all. "
"They previously all drove gigantic Mercedes diesels in Holland, so not that much different. "
"You do realise that cab drivers get discounts when buying cars, right. Especially if they're automatic cars, it's a +1!"
It‚Äòs a PR gig and only at the airport.
"Taxis in the Netherlands are absurdly expensive, so margins are probably decent.  Given how fantastic public transportation is there the only people who are taking taxis are people who are pretty loaded and expect to drive in a luxury car anyway.  "
"I don't know about profits, but Taxis are crazy expensive in NL. Just opening the door and sitting will cost you more than the whole ride in some European countries."
The Dutch have the most to lose if climate change results in sea level rise. I wonder if this has any semblance on how decisions are made over there. 
No this is just one taxi company that has replaced their fleet with Tesla. Although I think they are the largest company at the airport. But there are several others that still drive other cars.
AFAIK only EV taxis are allowed in Schiphol Airport. 
It probably means OP hasn't noticed all the dino juice burning taxis that still abound.
The area in this photo is taxi only. So the van and prius in front of the Teslas are probably also taxis.
"Can confirm. Was excited to get my first ride in a Tesla when I arrived in Amsterdam only to be disappointed when the only Mercedes in the queue was my ride...

As an aside, the train to central Amsterdam is easy to understand, gets you there in a fraction of the time, and costs a fiver (as opposed to 60‚Ç¨ for the cab)."
They are taxis to and from Amsterdam
Amsterdam Schiphol* 
*drops hat*
Why don't you
someone has money
I was there this past month. Not a huge fan :). I did however ride in one of those Tesla taxis from the airport to my hotel.
We sell allot of EV cars in our garage. Most of them are Hyundai Iconiq's and all of them goes to taxi drivers. 
"5000 subsidy
Priority at the airport saving lots of time each day getting at least twice the costumers as an diesel or hybrid.
Priority and soon exclusively at central station and leidseplein(main area in city centre) for taxi's

And in a couple of years all Taxi's need to be EV's. So there's a very aggressive plan for transitioning all the taxi's to electric in Amsterdam specifically. Now that the Model 3 is almost out for europe and the Nissan Leaf 2 came as well lots of taxi drivers who couldn't afford the Model S are going to switch sooner or later too."
"The official name of the airport is Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, its a 17 min train ride to Amsterdam Centraal, its ok to refer to it as Amsterdam.

Edit: Train time extended from 5 to 17 "
"Netherlands is just Amsterdam for most people, Rotterdam and the Haag is just expanstions.

Also, Uber was way better there than the USA. So cheap, and there is one within every block I was ever at. I just Ubered to everything and saved so much time, and technically money too because Amsterdam is stupid and has like 3 different metro companies like The bay area."
Then [explain this](http://www.urbancapture.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/121109-0858-Schiphol-Airport-Departures-Amsterdam-The-Netherlands.jpg). 
I was the only person impressed by this when I landed there
"Assuming you came from Schiphol, always feel free to ask if there‚Äôs a Tesla available, they are very aware that tourists love to go in them to see what it‚Äôs like. "
"Yes, at high usage, electric cars are cheaper than internal combustion cars. Taxis are driven 10 hours a day, they are going to be some of the first vehicles to switch on purely economic grounds. As of last month, all new black taxis in London are going to be electric, and once you include fuel costs they are cheaper than the previous diesel vehicles. And battery costs are consistently falling 15% a year. I expect it will be rare seeing a IC taxi in most cities worldwide within the next 15 years."
Is it Norway
"Yes, after a Dutch ''news'' channel ran an item about it, they took action and illegal taxi drivers are now fined pretty heavily if they're spotted in the area."
That's an exaggeration. The cars were still sold for about 60k excluding tax
"Yes. Taxis are very expensive here. Since public transport is so good, taxis are considered a very premium mode of transportation. That's why they use upmarket cars. 

Public transport to the city centre is a couple of euro's and often faster, a taxi will set you back like 50. "
From the airport? Absolutely. But even a bicycle taxi would be expensive for that distance
They're expensive if you compare it with the cost of a train ticket. I was in Amsterdam last month and i paid just over ‚Ç¨5 to get from Schiphol to the city center. 
"I'm guessing that guy wasn't driving one? Unless the car is running 24h (multiple drivers), very unlikely it needs a charge. Sounds like making up excuses for not having one. People almost fight for the Teslas in the airport queue, that alone probably gives them a higher return.

I've gotten a ride in one of these with 200.000+ km on it, and it still looked / felt good as new."
"Taking a taxi instead of a bus, and therefore paying more money, is not ‚Äòbeing ripped off‚Äô."
"So you call us a rip off for offering luxury services? A taxi ride is always a luxury, everybody knows that! Atleast with a Tesla you pay the same price but get a whole experience with it!

Don't call us a Rip Off. This is the best managed city for transportation in the world. Great taxi's worth their price. And great Public Transport"
"Have you met people from the UK? ;)

That's actually a joke, I get lots of UK costumers in my car all getting excited about Tesla. But the truth is they lack behind very far when it comes to infrastructure and incentives. But instead of Tesla's they probably go with this: http://www.theelectrictaxi.co.uk/

The black cab is iconic to them."
gl having a self driving car in bicycle infested amsterdam...
They are constantly moving forward. This is the official Airport taxi stand. Lots of people step in a taxi at the same time. Specially during rush hours.
This is at Schiphol airport in the Netherlands. These taxis would primarily be used for short trips to Amsterdam. So they aren't doing longer trips. They also rotate taxis so they can probably charge between assigned trips.
"I'm one of those Taxi Drivers. In my case I got an New 100D Model S I can drive 400 km atleast. The ones with older 85's from 2013 can do about 300 km. Which is still enough for a full day of work. But it get's a million times better. There's a supercharger exclussively for Tesla Taxi's at the airport and the public supercharger in Amsterdam has taxi's charging up quite often as well since they are both in the route from city to airport.

I usually charge every other day(not even every day) when I picked a number and have to wait for my turn or have my break."
The saved fuel costs/maintenance probably make up for the lost driving time while charging. 
"Trust me, in Amsterdam we have them too "
We work from the airport. But you see us in the city as well since 90% of our costumers get dropped off in the city and you can call or text us ofcourse :)
Same price as regular cab!
"It‚Äôs weird that you had to experience that. However, I fully understand the ""sod it I will expense it'. I am Dutch myself and work for a U.S. company, thankfully we use a travel booking agency and Concur so almost everything is arranged. 

You should not need to be worried about the language everyone should be perfectly fine talking English to you.

I am not sure where you are flying from but the next time you need to be in Oosterhout, try to book a flight to Rotterdam airport. Will save you loads of time!
"
"You made the mistake of taking a taxi, instead of excellent public transportation like the train which literally departs from underneath the airport and it's a 15 minute ride to the centre.

I can't stress this enough to tourists... The taxi's are luxury, not a primary mode of transportation."
"Honestly I think by now even North Korea has a better environment plan.

I am one of those Tesla Taxi drivers in Amsterdam, if you come to The Netherlands once or countries like Norway or Denmark you'll notice how organized and clean everything is. And great infrastructure!"
Heheh
Really it‚Äôs the main entrance and exit
Even if I work for 12 hours I have atleast 35% charge left in my 100D. We can supercharge at the airport too so never get into trouble
"Oh well, it's some kind of a marketing move. Cab drivers need to make a living too :D"
"Tesla's autonomous mode is glorified cruise control, it's nowhere near taking their jobs."
"Every job required driving will eventually be autonomous. They way I think of it, my car can soon make me money without me actually doing anything ;)

So owning an autonomous car could actually save you all the trouble but still give you profit. Have you ever checked out Elon Musks long Ted Talk where he talks about the possibility of letting drivers share their automous cars like uber does for cash in the future. Perhaps making a service like that available himself."
"You're thinking of Norway, probably. There will be some incentive in the Netherlands, but much lower."
You are talking about Norway or Denmark. In The Netherlands you basically still need to sell your kidney to buy one of those. Still I did it! Worth every penny definitely in the long run. I'm getting way more costumers and my job got a heck of a lot more fun!
You can‚Äôt fit 2 kids in a sedan?
"There's seating for 4 passengers even without the 3rd row rearward facing seat. The back seat is 3 across, plus the front passenger seat. "
"Aside from the fact mentioned earlier, it‚Äôs very normal here to sit in front in a taxi. Besides that there‚Äôs also other cars / vans available and more and more Model X‚Äôs are starting to show up.

Source: Born and raised in Amsterdam"
There's a taxi van in front of the Teslas. 
"Dutch Tesla owner here... The Supercharger in Amsterdam is full of taxis, rather annoyingly so. So much they are getting a special taxi only Supercharger at Schiphol airport... The average Tesla taxi has done 350000 kilometers after 5 years of use and is being sold after that.

And I forgot one important thing: a Tesla being environmentally friendly doesn't cost roadtax. A Mercedes E Diesel costs around 1860,- euros per year on road tax."
/r/theydidthemath
It‚Äôs even faster payoff if the tesla is only charging at free supercharger stations.  Great work 
"How about the cost of Tesla repairs after the warranty expires?  Only Tesla is able to operate on their cars and from what we've seen it can get expensive when things go wrong.  Whereas Mercedes has a bunch of 3rd party shops to fix problems.  

The battery and drive train are covered for 8 years so costs can dramatically escalate after that.  We know that car maintenance and repair costs are the lowest during the first 5 years of car ownership.  Your assumption of those costs is based on the first 5 years extrapolated thru year 10, but what about those costs after year 8 once the drive train and battery warranty expires?  The first Model S rolled off the production line in 2012 and they're still within that 8 year drive train / battery warranty period until 2020.

>10 years to make up savings

>CASH IN AFTER TEN YEARS AND SELL THAT SHIT.

How much do you think you'll be able to sell a 10 year old Tesla for when it has something like half a million miles on the total distance? Hell, do you think it'll even run? Provided that you do, do you really think the difference between the selling price of a 10 year old Tesla vs a 10 year old Mercedes is going to be the dealbreaker?

I applaud the math, but good christ man. Cars have an economic life of 5 years. Depreciation would be at negative 100% if that were a possibility after 10."
Taxi drivers in Europe generally don't keep their cars for ten years so I actually think you just proved that it's not worth it or the difference is negligible
"Can confirm, over in the UK there's a lot of Mercedes as taxis but they tend to be higher tier, business models or private hire,

My friends dad recently sold his company which is a executive travel service which had I think, 25-30 Mercedes as the taxis,

Normally taxis tend to be stuff like, Prius, ford fiesta (newer model) and big old people carriers for that group of 7 drunk girls that won't shut the fuck up about going to weatherspoons and getting drunk."
"In Amsterdam they might get up to ‚Ç¨10k in incentives (5k municipal + 5k country), plus no ownership tax, and a company car tax of 4% instead of 20%+. On top of that, taxi vehicles are exempt of VAT (21%) on purchase.

That would bring the investment down from ‚Ç¨87k to ‚Ç¨58k - same as the Mercedes, with the much lower running costs!"
How does battery diminish on cars. Are the battery replacement costs included in your calculations?
"Not sure how much it matters, but they run closer to 60k+ km a year. Some of them, from September 2014, are currently for sale at 220k-280k km driven. ([Source](https://www.allcarscompany.nl/aanbod/?vehicle=premium&brand=tesla&model&price_min&price_max&kilometer_min&kilometer_max&transmission&manufacture_year_min&manufacture_year_max&fuel#resultaten)).
Also, resale value seems a lot higher than a comparable ex-taxi E-class. ([Source](https://www.autoscout24.com/offers/mercedes-benz-e-200-200-cdi-amb-avant-diesel-black-f0cf4760-1d20-237c-e053-e350040a9acc))"
There is also yearly emission tax that obviously goes in favor of Tesla.
"Might wanna add to your comment that diesel is only cheaper because owners of diesel cars pay a higher tax (wegenbelasting, or road-tax as a tough translation). So the difference is probably a little higher than this."
"Yes, it is common for European countries to fiscally force greener options. Much moreso than the US."
"While all this is true, I doubt taxi operators pay the list price for the Mercedes. Afaik at least in Germany, they give heavy discounts on vehicles used as taxis.

Then again, maybe they also have some bulk deal with Tesla."
Do you in any way work for Tesla? 
"It's more complicated for the Tesla when it comes to repairs unless the taxi companies are willing to use loaners without the livery. Tesla can take a long time to repair due to availability of replacement parts, and a car out of circulation is racks up lost opportunities to make money. It gets uglier if the repairs require bodywork. Service is getting better though, and even if it's not as profitable in the short term as a taxi, I could see it flipping in favor of the Tesla in the long run."
Wouldn't you also need to have a slightly larger fleet to compensate for the relatively slow charging vs pumping gas?
"In Norway we pay a negligible vehicle registration tax yearly for electric cars, petrol and diesel cost a lot more. Did you add such costs into your calculations, it could sway figures to an even better level! "
A taxis only puts on 32000K a year?! That‚Äôs crazy low. I put normal put on around 50-60 thousand per year. You would think that since the taxis are constantly in use they would be significantly higher 
"You also have to consider incentives towards electric cars, I'm sure there are some in the Netherlands"
"For the record, this fleet is for the airport. They have around 166 cars if I‚Äôm not mistaken. "
"You have omitted road taxes. In the UK, electric cars have significantly lower road tax rates than other cars. "
"One factor that will make the payoff even faster is city driving, as opposed to highway driving with the diesel. Fuel usage will be far higher.

Also, maintenance costs on taxis are higher, again due to the city driving (stop start traffic). This is less of an issue with a Tesla as well (regenerative breaking). "
"And this is not taking into account toll and taxed, ""green"" vehicles are way cheaper in most Europe.

Also insurance are based on data collected by vehicles; as Tesla has many ""safety"" feature, probably this will also make a difference again a ""fully manual"" car"
Great post but I believe Mercedes in Europe are discounted in bulk for Taxis especially since they‚Äôre manufactured in region. Someone can correct me if I am wrong about this.
"For taxi drivers, time is money.

You need to take into account the recharge time vs fill-up time as well. you'll need to recharge atleast once a day. and that hour at the supercharger will add up."
"I'd add a couple of other things:

1) there are certain areas only electric cars can go, which will make a difference

2) registration costs will be lower on the Tesla being electric verses a regular car. Here in Belgium it's something under ‚Ç¨100 a year compared to several hundred for a regular car, for a business I'm not sure since there are special rules there. Also here we can exempt more with an electric car on taxes than with a regular car.

3) that number will be much larger per year with more miles driven, electricity costs being much lower and efficiency at lower speeds for Amsterdam driving"
"I was in Amsterdam last year and the taxi driver said the recharges are free, they do them during their breaks and so it‚Äôs cheaper for them "
I can't believe a taxi only does 20k a year
"Also, it's subsidized, heavily "
"Wait, is it strange that we get taxi'd in Mercedes cars?"
Also the Dutch government provide incentives for taxi drivers to buy Tesla. 
there is only one flaw in the math. taxi cars are rarely bought new. Taxicompanies buy used mercedes with already 100k km on them for really cheap (think 20k euro) because that sirt of milage on a mercedes diesel is good to go for another 100k

"> Edmund's says repairs and maintenance on the Mercedes amount to 15106 euros over 5 years, that's around 3021 euros/year.

It does, but that's absolutely ridiculous. First two year are on warranty anyway, so the repair costs are literally ‚Ç¨0. And on only 30,000km a year it'll only need one service per year for maybe ‚Ç¨700.

>Tl;dr: It's actually less expensive than the most common options!

After showing that even in your fantasyland it takes *ten* years to break even on a Model S? And the remaining value after *ten* year and 300,000km will be pretty much the same on both cars."
At least in Germany the car industry highly subsidies the cars 
umm not to mention there is no pollution.
Isn't there a tax for non-hybrid or non-electric cars?
Resale on an electric car is pretty bad.. no one wants a 10 year old electric car with a battery that‚Äôll die soon...
Thank you for doing the math.
"Don't forget the added comfort and coolness factor of the tesla likely attracting customers, making people feel less bad about choosing a taxi insread of the train/bike etc. The tesla does have a lonher charging time, so may lose some rides while charging."
What about the down time when a tesla has to charge? What's the average distance a taxi drivers drives a day?
"I‚Äôm pretty sure battery degradation on EVs, causes them to depreciate differently. A heavily used, ten year old EV is definitely at battery replacement age (assuming it hasn‚Äôt already been). 

Plus you assumed the battery performance and range will stay the same over 10 years. 

But I don‚Äôt wanna do the math. So good job. "
"And there's the reason behind the rather perfect roads in the Netherlands, annual road tax.

- MB E class: ‚Ç¨1.828,00
- T Model S: ‚Ç¨0,00"
"Price wise I agree. As a Tesla owner myself though, I can easily seeing the range being an issue if you‚Äôre driving all day for a living. 

Having to take 30-60 minute breaks to charge (on a Supercharger) and during down rides based on distance can be a huge disruption to that type of business. "
I love your Murphy‚Äôs law data assumptions in this. Thanks for making this post!
"Great post, but your conclusion from the numbers as you posted them is wrong. 10 years is not the term taxi‚Äôs are in it to make a profit. You have missed a very important part: resale value (which can be as much as ‚Ç¨45000). You also missed government grants and subsidies. Besides that, there are several taxes you didn‚Äôt have to pay when you bought this a few years ago (changes all the time but the base price was considerably lower because of that), plus some tax deductibles, and most importantly: you don‚Äôt have to pay road taxes (about ‚Ç¨2000/year for the Mercedes). 

Add this to the story and the Tesla‚Äôs ROI is way higher and the conclusion would actually be correct. "
"Great effort! I actually think Taxi do considerably more mileage per year, also in the Netherlands. I would expect something like 60k-70K kilometers. This off course would make the case for Tesla even better.  There are also Nissan Leaf taxi's in A'dam, but these will probably have a hard time to do 70K per year...
"
Good breakdown. I would say i think 10 years is quite some time to see a return on such a purchase an i understand its based on worst case scenario figures. I wonder how much of an impact the model 3 will have on this.
"I was in a model X in Amsterdam recently. The driver told me the rrp is ‚Ç¨130k but after government subsidies etc it costs, ‚Ç¨80k. So that might make things more reasonable. "
"1 little fact you forgot.

Conventional taxis idle running times wether in traffic or parked are huge. and amount for an insane amount lf gasoline. while electric cars on idle cost nothing

"Matey mate, no one taxis in E class Mercedes round here, try Prius prices. Maybe C class, rare to find something much more expensive. I did once get a taxi from a guy driving an RS4, he was retired and loved driving. Otherwise your reasoning seems pretty good but there aren‚Äôt any ¬£60,000 taxis driving round that I‚Äôve seen."
You forgot to calculate that Tesla recharge at Tesla station is free for 10 years!
"This.
Was.
Epic.

I love 'Tesla math', when you really take into account all the variables as was done here, the cost of ownership on a Tesla is quite reasonable. This is why I cringe every time someone compares a Model 3 to an ICE car in the same price range. It's not an even comparison money-wise. Most people consider the savings in gas (conservatively, it's about 1/3 the cost here in the U.S.), but usually the lower cost of maintainence goes over looked. 

Well done DanielShaww!"
literally you da real mvp here

"It's not like charging an electric car is expensive compared to fuel prices either, with Dutch fuel prices being around ‚Ç¨1.58 pr. liter, or $7.38/gallon. Electricity prices being, for private use, around ‚Ç¨0.156/kWh, or $0.192/kWh, but let's use these because they're basically worst case. 

Let's use the wikipedia consumption numbers and we get the following: 38 kWh/100 mi 24 kWh/100 km. That puts us at $7.3/100mi or ‚Ç¨3,7/100km. Let's compare these numbers to the wikipedia numbers for a Prius on a combined cycle, which is 60mpg or 3.9l/100km. With Dutch fuel prices we end up with it costing about $12.3/100mi, or ‚Ç¨6.2/100km. 

So, with no supercharging whatsoever and home prices for electricity a Tesla taxi saves, over the course of 100k miles about $5000, or over the course of 100k km about ‚Ç¨2400. Obviously the US metric nets us 60% more distance, but if we look at $/100k km we still get about $3100 savings pr. 100k km. 100,000kms is not an unusual distance for taxis to drive over the course of year, they'll often drive more than this as well. 

The savings if you supercharge for free are obviously quite large, and that's when comparing to the optimistic numbers for a Prius. "
or they just used a referal 
"Wait, you have to pay to use the charging stations?"
"In addition to this, the Taxi's max out the free supercharging option. As a result there are always huge lines at the supercharging site of Tesla in A'dam....
"
"Lower maintenance makes sense, inherently, but I‚Äôm curious if anyone has seen any hard data on this comparing maintenance costs of Teslas against similar ICE cars. "
Makes sense.
Electric cars were also subsidized as fuck in Norway last time I checked though
"Intresting, the taxi industry might give us insight to the longevity of electric cars. "
Yah higher fees ate expected. 
I took one of them from the airport there about 6 months ago and my kid left his iPad in the backseat. Called up and they delivered it to us where we were staying that night. Great customer service from whatever company it was :)
The time when the batteries were shipped on request is coming to an end. They are or will be stocking them all over Europe soon. It won‚Äôt work otherwise. 
Batteries are quite reliable only a small percent of cars will need to change the battery if something very bad goes wrong.

"I was there in October and was picked up in a normal sedan. Don‚Äôt remember exactly what kind, but it was a stick. 

Though I guess taxis aren‚Äôt always great at following rules..."
"You are somewhat correct, Amsterdam has a green zone for the most part of its centrum which means certain diesels are not allowed there. And the plans (or intentions) are to have an emission free city by 2025.

I think that taxi company had to buy a new fleet anyway and decided for something future proof.

They are not the only one though, I come by the airport everyday and see alot of Hyundai Ioniq's as well"
"I often see regular taxi cabs and vans at Schiphol, it‚Äôs just that the vast majority are Model S and X. Combustion engines certainly aren‚Äôt banned ar the airport."
"Interesting.  I‚Äôm there in a month, I‚Äôll see what I can get!"
In case you thought I was talking about Schiphol Detroit

You can‚Äôt just move anywhere. What about citizenship?

"Yeah,  but there are normal taxis in Amsterdam. You only get ‚ÄúTesla exclusive‚Äù taxi at Schiphol airport. 

Source: just moved back to America after living in Amsterdam for 5 months. "
That explains the giant Amsterdam sign outside the terminal. 
"However, Schiphol is situated in the municipality of Haarlemmermeer, which is definitely not the same as the municipality of Amsterdam"
"It takes more like 15 minutes on the train, but I agree it's reasonable to call it Amsterdam."
[A 17 min train ride to be precise](https://www.ns.nl/reisplanner/#/?aankomst=Amsterdam%20Centraal&aankomsttype=treinstation&tijd=2018-03-04T17:58&type=vertrek&vertrek=Schiphol%20Airport&vertrektype=treinstation). The airport is located quite a bit south of the city.
"I think our 4 biggest cities are all less then an hour by train apart from every other one and some also about 15 min , so the scale is pretty different. But still kinda agree."
"Well, that sign originated in Amsterdam, and it provides tourists with a nice photo opportunity as they can sit on all the letters or just use it as a background. They added another one of these signs at the airport for the same reason. 

Schiphol is official name of the Airport, some refer to it as Amsterdam International Airport, but it technically is not located in Amsterdam. Amsterdam is about 17min away from Schiphol by train. 

Source: I live in The Netherlands "
We went to the 3rd guy in the taxi line (he was the first tesla) and promptly hopped in.
The taxi stand has security guards showing people the way to their taxi's in order of 1st come 1st go. But you can definitelly ask they won't mind if the line is short.
"It must be really different for taxi companies than for freelancers, the Dutch tax rules that applied until 2013: MIA, KIA, Vamil and 0% bijtelling.

So ~ ‚Ç¨ 90k, minus ~30% MIA and ~30% KIA. (I don't remember the amounts exactly)"
"Oh shit thanks, I‚Äôm flying out tomorrow, will definitely get bus or train. Which is better?"
It‚Äôs only a 20 minute journey though isn‚Äôt it?
"He was driving in one. That‚Äôs the point of my story. I‚Äôm just relaying what the driver told him. 

Probably looked new because he said they are constantly replacing things in them. Lots of maintenance and cosmetic issues. "
"Correct, that's assuming you are aware you're paying more than any other taxi. 

If you're just a tourist, especially with a currency you might not be familiar with... makes these taxis a rip off.. 

It's people's choice to waste 50 euro on a taxi... Doesn't stop it from being ""a rip off""  

Make sense?  "
"I wonder what would be funnier, sitting in the driver's seat with a beer in your hand or sitting in the backseat and having the front seats empty.

I wonder how the guys at Tesla tested them honestly."
"There are superchargers at the airport for taxi's while they wait for their turn. Most only charge during their break and hangout waiting for their turn. I have an Model S 100D, I can drive 2 shifts without charging sometimes. Ofcourse I don't haha to make sure I'm always ready to accept a long drive."
I will remember and Im looking for a future ride. Thx :)
Yeah I think basically my employer at the time were just trying to cut back on travel costs. They had me fly to Schipol rather than Rotterdam because the flight was like ¬£100 cheaper. 
"I‚Äôm aware, but it‚Äôs pushing the industry towards autonomous driving, it‚Äôs not there yet, but it‚Äôs improving rapidly."
Yes you‚Äôre right üôÇ 
"Two adults, taxi driver and two kids, at an airport (luggage) in a model S? Not really."
"I have an S, it's big enough for four people comfortably, but the rear center seat is really narrow compared to the sides. I couldn't even comfortably fit my two inlaws and their child's seat in the middle without some chafing and difficulty accessing the buckles each time we exit. If you regularly drive with more than 4 people, the X is so much better.  At our airport, we mainly see commercial minivans since you can easily fit a full family and all their luggage for an international flight or rideshare.  Only the Uber drivers bring a lot of sedans."
"I found it frustrating traveling in Europe with more than two teens unless everyone splits up and pays for two taxis or Uber.  Even the S doesn't really accommodate three people well in the back seat, the Model X can carry more people or just more standing luggage  at almost an insignificant price difference. Maybe that's why the S are lined up at the curb while the X are out dropping off customers "
"1900 per year?

thats so much. i thought roadtax (at least here in germany) is caculated mainly by co2 emission. now my rav 4 costs 360 in taxes per year and it isnt excactly a clean car. what does an e diesel blow out of its pipes?"
How much are the used tesla taxis going for?

"Don't assume this. Tesla is actively discouraging this activity. However, you can assume that taxi companies can have their own private charging facilities, where they can obtain power at industrial or commercial use rates (lower than residential)."
"I think battery degradation isn't an issue with the larger packs in reasonably cool climates. And the drive train is far less complex than in the combustion vehicles. The fact that it only has 1 gear means that they can afford to make that single gear far stronger.

https://electrek.co/2016/11/01/tesla-battery-degradation/"
"Tesla taxis (and many other taxis) are sold before the warranty expires.

Also, the Car Guru video is very misleading because most of the parts that break can be repaired quite cheaply (especially the handles) but Tesla chooses to replace the whole thing."
"I'd be interested to see what the battery capacity actually would be on a Tesla after 500k km... Even 50% of an 85kw battery would get over 200km range and would be enough for average city users.

Given the brand value of Tesla, I will be interested to see how they retain their value at high mileage"
"Yeah... This analysis doesn't really make sense.

A 10 year pay off period to break even is incredibly long and from what I remember teslas need an overhaul at 8 years to replace the battery which needs to either be paid for at the time or an expensive warranty purchased at time of original purchase. 

This Tesla forum post shows that the minimum quoted price is 12,000$ but people have been given prices of 45,000$. 

https://forums.tesla.com/en_CA/forum/forums/tesla-model-s-85kw-battery-replacement-cost

That means that its unlikely the Tesla will ever make it to the 10 year payoff period. 

The other factor that OP didn't consider is that a Tesla needs half a day to charge (or if using super charger that battery replacement will come a whole lot sooner), which means the car is off the road and not making money. 

I doubt the Tesla can actually get up to 32,000km a year of travel (which actually seems light for a taxi...) on a regular schedule if taking charging time into account. 

I've taken a Tesla before both as an uber and from the airport and I think they're great. But they're definitely not the cost effective option right now."
"It didn't take into account the resale value, after 3 or 5 years that might make a difference."
Well this is different for every country but in germany we almost only got mercedes as a taxi. 
In Finland we have mostly upper tier Mercedes as taxis and the price is closer to what you pay for those business models in UK. Uber is so far banned here until law change might allow it next summer.
Why he sell
I love that I can totally relate to the quip about drunk girls across the pond 
"Based on Tesloop, which is running their cars in commercial service between LA and Las Vegas, they saw ~6% pack degradation after 200k miles.

Extrapolating battery longevity across the Tesla fleet, the total cost of ownership (even assuming battery replacement after 10 years) is lower than internal combustion vehicles."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2CaWaKjS1Y

this is a great video, he is a fanboy of Tesla, but he backs up the estimates and numbers with real world data.

I'm getting a model 3 when they come out in Europe, just right when I want to replace my old diesel car."
"A Tesla employee once told me they‚Äôre guaranteed 10 years, but expected to last 15 or so. If outside of that 10 year mark, it would cost you about $10,000usd to replace it all. However, that‚Äôs essentially the same as having a brand new engine. Considering what seems to be less wear and tear on Teslas, it‚Äôs not that bad."
My understanding is you can replace the individual cells on Tesla‚Äôs so the repair cost is pretty low. 
"Well,  that just tilts the balance towards Tesla even more. "
"And 7,5l/100 km? No way. Way more than that."
"Yes,  fiscal measures like yearly road taxes based on emissions which are inexistent / negligible in the US are commonplace in Europe. Adding them to the equation would further tilt the math towards Tesla 'a favor,  but by now I figured those savings would be miniscule if compared to the big 3: fuel,  maintenance and repairs. 
...  or maybe I was just lazy :) "
"Nah, Reddit just shills for Tesla for free."
That would be quite a career change! 
"The average daily trip of a taxi can comfortably fit inside the range of a Tesla, although there will be exceptions.

Assuming that the fastest charging option is a commercial 3 phase (superchargers aren't for commercial use) that's a recharge time of about 3-4 hours depending on the size of the battery. If the cars are owned by a company and rotated through the roster there will be overlap (unless peak hours are covered with additional cars that won't be in use during charging hours anyway). If the drivers are contractors and provide their own vehicle then the vehicle will last a shift. "
"In Germany, the most common car insurance mileage is 15000km/y. 
I‚Äôd have estimated taxis‚Äò use higher too, though. "
A taxi in Europe. I assume you're American who spend a lot more time driving than us over here. I believe the average distance per vehicle here in Norway is about 10000 miles/year.
"Put a charger at the airport. Charge the car while it waits for customers. Your correct driving nonstop? Not Tesla. Able to stop, for lunch and charge? Tesla is cheaper. "
"I have no idea what repairs cost on a  Tesla, but it would be interesting to see the projected maintenance costs /100km as well. And also if there's a yearly tax rebate for running an electric vehicle. The savings could end up being negligible or perhaps even much greater"
"This doesn't take into account any potential battery fatigue from that level of use or lost opportunity cost while recharging.  It's an encouraging idea and I think I'd probably hop in a Tesla cab for the novelty of it but I can't find a way to rationalize it economically in my brain.  Especially if you consider the up front cost of a Prius vs a Model S.  Even assuming there was no loss of opportunity cost due to charge time there's still a $40k price difference in initial investment.  So sometime after a million km you might break even assuming no other maintenance costs.  
  
Of course as you said if they supercharge free that brings to total savings over 100k kilometers up to about $5k so now it's only 800k km before you break even.  Still assuming all other maintenance costs are the same.  "
Might be a good time to open up a supercharcing station kind of like a gas station but make it a nice place to relax for 30 minutes or so.
I have spent more on oil changes for my fiat then I have on oil changes for my tesla.
"Tax wise, yes. Mostly on purchase. They still cost more than a Prius and many other typical taxi vehicles. For businesses the purchase price isn't really a big issue. It's the total cost of ownership (ToC) that matters. Downtime due to reliability and charging are important because any minute a taxi isn't on the road is potentially lost revenue. "
"Incorrect, there is a high tax on combustion engines so the Tesla is at a relative price. We just get stung hard on cars with big engines. "
"Yeah, plus they have plenty of non-ev shuttles there as well"
I could tell you the same thing by your needless correction. 
"Amsterdam (well, the Netherlands) has the [DAFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAFT) for Americans, it's actually one of the easier EU countries for Americans to move to.

It's not as easy as moving between cities or states obviously, but a lot of people don't know about it."

Mia = 36% of your profit on a cap of 50.000 euro‚Äôs which in the end means 4000 euro‚Äôs or something of that figure. 5000 euro‚Äôs subsidized for electric Taxi‚Äôs in Amsterdam. A charge point build in your street without additional costs for buying an electric car. However using it does costs a lot of money. No BPM and no RoadTax on Electric cars.

These are all the incentives available. Except for the 5000 euro subsidy all these incentives are for the public. Not just taxi‚Äôs"
"Train is definitely easiest! Once you go through arrivals, the train station is right below the big hall. Buy a ticket at the machines or the counter and go down the escalator to the platform. Really easy and probably the fastest way to get to the city centre. "
"The train! Will get you to Amsterdam Central in 12 minutes. Get an 'OV-chipkaart', it's like a debit card you can use to pay in all the trains, buses, subways and trams in the whole country. You can get one at Schiphol.

"Locals take the train which departs underneath the airport to Amsterdam Centraal (15mins) or other directions.

The bus is good also but I'd say nothing beats the train with price and speed."
That's so cool to hear.  Can't wait till I can afford a Tesla!

I agree it‚Äôs not very good in the back seat but that‚Äôs more of a tesla problem. 
"The emission is taxed when you buy the car. An extra tax before sales tax called BPM. A car is typically 20-30% more expensive here than in Germany for the exact same model. A Ford Mustang V8 is 75.000 euros extra tax because of co2 here... Like three times the price of the car in the USA...

A car is a cow... The government milkes it as much as possible..."

"Also, electric vehicles probably get closer to ideal fuel efficiency in stop-and-go traffic, let alone waiting for passengers where they should be drastically better than an idling engine.

Diesels are more efficient at idle than gas engines, but we can still expect the Tesla to outperform in a taxi scenario, compared to the original analysis given here.

That's true even if electricity isn't free. As you say, it isn't free but might in fact be discounted. "
">Tesla is actively discouraging this activity

Why?
___
Nvm, googled. 

For the uninitiated: https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/17/tesla-discourages-commercial-cars-from-using-superchargers/"
"From the article linked below, it sounds like Tesla is discouraging the abuse of the supercharger network.

Doesn‚Äôt seem to be a problem as long as you‚Äôre keeping it reasonable. "
"I didnt assume anything. I just said ""if"".  

Someone else in the comments mentioned that some Taxi's companies were doing that, so I thought it was relevant to add to his great analysis.  "
200 km is nothing if u need to go somewhere.
"8 years is simply the warranty. Has nothing to do with ‚Äúoverhaul‚Äù. Check your sources. 

Supercharging intermittently is healthy for the battery

You have many errors here. "
Mercedes also sells their E-Class taxis for way less than OP stated. It‚Äôs more like 40000 USD. The Netherlands are not doing this for cost reasons
"Tesla-Bj√∏rn (famous youtuber) drives 40-50k km a year with his X 90PL. In Norway, with extreme cold temperatures at times. You're assuming too much here, thus also being wrong alot. "
"In Germany, Mercedes made versions of the E class specifically for the Taxi industry. These cars were made of much cheaper materials than the regular consumer Mercedes and came with discounts as long as the car was used as a taxi. They also integrated taxi features into the car so they didn't need to be retrofitted afterwards. 

The point is they might have the Mercedes badge, but taxi companies are not plaything the list prices that OP was using for his companion."
"Yea but they have low end Mercedes, this was a while ago but I didn‚Äôt know Mercedes made non leather interiors until I got into one of their taxis in Germany "
"Recently i literally saw a Kia at a taxi stand in germany. Walked right up to the second-in-line: A proper E-Class.

Costs the same to me, why should i choose the Kia?"
"only 6 percent? that's way less than I thought it would be. I thought it'd degrade by more than 6 percent a year.

So how come a tesla battery pack degrades 6 percent over many years, but every laptop battery or phone battery degrades by 50 percent in two years?"
Not to mention that the actual replacement cost 10 years from now will be significantly lower. 
On hand I'm happy that we have engines that don't fail as much but on the other hanD I NEED TO FUCKING MAJOR IN ELECTROTECHNICAL MECHANISMS TO CHANGE A FUCKING LIGHTBULB CHRIST ALLMIGHTY
"No, not true."
"he took the worst case for the Tesla and compared to the best case for the Mercedes, but for a car that big at 7.5l/100km, that would be very surprising. "
You are correct. Its all by design. If we were all the same we wouldn't be able to move money around or have a need for an economic system. üëç
"As long as the vehicle is under warranty service and maintenance costs should be a lot lower. In general, they should also be lower because you're getting out of a lot of ICE related costs. Oil changes, oil filters, air filters, fuel filters, spark plugs, timing belts, everything related to the emission systems, etc. Wear on brakes is a lot lower as well, but you need to take care so they don't rust. Everything else should be similar, except the cost of changing a battery out of warranty. "
"I'd think the uptake of Tesla taxis would be a lot lower if it didn't make any sense financially, but me and you second guessing their reasoning aren't going to help. Maybe they just want to pollute less? 

As for battery fatigue: I replied to another comment with links to an article about a Tesla in Finland that had done more than 400,000km and the battery had 93% capacity left. The first cabdriver in Norway with a Tesla stated that he could often do a whole day's driving well within one charge. "
How droll.  More looking for summary data that looks at overall cost of ownership (inclusive of repairs) of an ICE car compared to a Tesla.   
"They changed it in 2017, the tax isn't measured by engine size anymore as it used to be. It's now on CO2 and NOx production."

Although in Europe it is quite easy to move between countries. If you are citizen of a European Union (EU) country you can very easily move to another EU country

"Not disagreeing with the comment above, nor yours, but he listed official Mercedes price in the netherlands in ‚Ç¨ which is what matters in the context of europe and you listed no source and price off the top of your head in USD. Not to mention cars are usually much more expensive here compared to the US(most shit is really). Maybe it could be cheaper than what OP stated, wouldn‚Äôt be surprised but it‚Äôs not as clear cut as ‚Äúit‚Äôs more like X USD‚Äù, at least provide some source and sonething. Because unfortunately price differences in US vs Europe are never that simple otherwise most tech wouldn‚Äôt cost more in ‚Ç¨ than it does in $ regardless of the difference between both currencies. "
"Can't blame you for not knowing Dutch tax laws. (From memory, so please correct me) new cars have two significant taxes; BTW sales tax (21%) and [BPM tax](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/themaoverstijgend/brochures_and_publications/bpm-tariffs) (up to 45%). 

So the Mercedes 220d of ‚Ç¨40.962 will cost ‚Ç¨55.578 (at least, without accessories), ‚Ç¨8.602 of that is sales tax. BPM can be seen as a luxury tax, so the more expensive, heavy, and polluting your vehicle is, the more you pay. Norway does/did this in a similar way, but more extreme, that's why they have the largest EV count per capita."
"Leather interior is the low end option, although it's usually more expensive."
Bc laptop and phone batteries are not made to last? Do they have thermal cooling in them like a Tesla? 
"Properly managing battery health (BMS + liquid coolant system) as well as additional unused capacity.

tesla battery tech is more advanced.
What are you basing that on
"with two of my cars you need hands that are SUPER tiny to get the the bulbs. I have fairly normal hands, but I'd need Trump size hands to get to bulbs with ease."
"It all depends, but each pack is built with many individual cells making a ""pack"" and those packs make the whole battery.

The thing is when the batteries need replacement in 10 to 15 years they are going to be much cheaper than they are now. The motors themselves are fairly cheap, so the replacement of parts to make them ""new"" again won't be super high for the level of car, but in 10 to 15 years the types of cars out there that aren't self driving will be few and far between is my suspicion.

"After a quick Google, I used a few average figures I find to get a cost of maintenance at $60.8/100mi for an ICE car, and $3.50/100mi for the Tesla. Neither of those are based on the amount of driving a cab will do, but still..."
Are there different rules regarding maintenance if you're using a car for business instead of personal use? Does Tesla care?
Holy crap this argument is so useless ...

On mine you need to pull the entire headlight out that is screwed on with two torx screws which essentially force you to drive to the dealership to get your light changed..  Like.. why? We are one iteration away from having to verify our fingerprint to pour wiper fluid.

"IDK how they get $60.8/100 mi. Seems a little high if an electric is $3.50.

"Yea, this shit is way to crazy ..."
"IDK how they got the numbers either but I think the averages include more than routine maintenance. There a chance the Tesla one didn't account for anything behind routine maintenance?

"Ok I found my original source for that number and I believe it includes fuel, maintenance, insurance, etc. Every cost associated with vehicle ownership.

This house looks **really** similar to the one from yesterday. I thought the photo might have just been flipped. I took the time to check - this is in fact a different house.
Still waiting for Tesla to call me and say my tiles are ready. I can't wait to get these installed.   I also need a new roof so it would be nice if this could speed up.
Wow never thought I'd say... that is one sexy roof

I like it a lot!  It will probably be a really long time before I'll get to see something like this in Ohio.
"I don't understand how the Balance of Systems (BoS) works on these solar tiles? How does the DC wiring work? How is the DC to DC contact between panels happen?

"I'm building a bigger house and it still doesn't make any financial sense to spring for a tesla roof compared to asphalt. It's purely a high end luxury statement in 2018 or if you need to live off the grid and not deal with ""ugly"" panels. That money could be better thrown at things like geothermal, or quality insulation to reduce energy costs and have enough left over for a model 3

Then there's the paradox of having to chop down  shading trees to improve solar energy generation that I tried to rationalize "
I‚Äôm in Canada and it snows quite a bit. Would the solar panels material make it easier for snow to slide down or melt off? Just wondering on the effectiveness in northern countries?
"It's my understanding the Tesla solar roof is composed of glass shingles, though only a portion of those shingles contain photovoltaic cells. The remaining glass shingles are present only to provide a uniform look to the roof.  These roofs are very expensive.

Could the expense be significantly lessened by installing only the photovoltaic shingles in the optimum number and location on the roof, and using traditional roofing materials on the remaining roof? 

It would be more attractive than a traditional roof with traditional solar panels and less attractive than a complete Tesla roof but the cost would fall somewhere between the two."
I know it's supposed to look like regular tiles but I kinda want it to look all futuristic...
"I would love one of these, but could never afford it"
Pretty cool to hear they have a Model 3 and a Bolt.  I'm envious of what that guy has spent on cars and his roof in a year!!!

"I thought these tiles had flaws, I heard they butt them up against each other and when they move they just scratch and renders them useless after a few years"
"When these were first described to me, I didn't think they were going to do well.

Why? Because honestly, people as a whole are kind of shitty. Part of the allure of solar panels on your roof is that people see them and know that you have them. I honestly didn't think it would be enough to simply KNOW you were trying to do something for the environment, I thought having OTHER PEOPLE know was going to be required for any kind of widespread adoption. Like how important it used to be to talk about your hybrid. Or remind people that you're vegan.

But, I'm just realizing now that people don't really interact with their neighbors anymore. We don't keep up with the Jones' on our block anymore... fuck those guys. It's on social media... which is why it isn't important that people on the street know what you got.

"If you ignore the insane price, this is really amazing. It's a modern home that doesn't pollute. Next step is obviously incorporating electric heating."
I'm kicking myself for replacing our roof last year.  We are installing panels in the next month or so.
"You‚Äòll be fine. I don‚Äòt get why people would even want to plaster their whole roof with solar. They‚Äòre all rigged up in series so any panel that‚Äòs in the shade will define the power output in that array. You look at the house in the picture, with a tree right next to it, and the irregular roof structure, it‚Äòs gonna be causing itself to be shaded at times.

I love the high tech look of my panels. This whole ‚Äûlooks just like a normal roof‚Äú is not my thing. Maybe if I had to contend with a stupid HOA as I hear many people in the US have to, it‚Äòd be a consideration that it‚Äòs stealthy."
My thoughts exactly.  This is a damn sexy roof. 
"The technology isn't really there yet. Right now, I would expect these things to have pretty steep degradation curves and produce far fewer kWh per square foot of roof space at a higher price. I would wait a few years to let competition and research drive prices down and efficiency up."
Hah! Same thought here. Thanks for confirming
"It's because they are super easy to work on, with minimal obstructions and the lengths of the roof are modified to fit perfectly with tiles to avoid cutting.  "
They got it extended. Now it goes all the way to the top
There are a lot of really beautiful roofs on homes but they tend to be overlooked because people care more about what the kitchen looks like.

Any specifics on cost and kW?   We just signed a contract for a normal solar panel installation through a solar cooperative in FL at $1.90/watt.  8.7 kW system on a standing seam metal roof.  
"From what I remember I think it's somewhere around $25 / sqft. I could be wrong though. For my house it was about $35,000 for 2,000 sqft and 2 stories."
"I'm gonna guess ""if you have to ask, you don't want to know"""
I thought they were aiming for the same cost as a regular roof? 
"Hopefully by 2020-2021, the price will cut by half, like the powerwall, then it would be affordable to everyone and would spread like fire. Here's hoping :-)"
"Oh man, I would scream if there was a demo house in Ohio where you could see the roof with a Tesla charging and such."
"Yeah, I vaguely remember there having been another company that had solar tiles similarly, and they had dimension limitations to rectangles of certain sizes so that they could meet DC/DC series/parallel requirements for the hardware.

It doesn't solar the whole roof, it solars a rectangle and makes the rest of the roof to match aesthetically.

The main durability concern over time was the electrical interface because the tiles slide together making contact.  If even one is wiggly-loose, it's too loose to be a good electrical contact.  That's fine if you install it correctly they'll say.  The other Electrician I spoke to suggested that when your roof warps after 25 years it won't matter how tight it was during installation."
They over promise and under deliver consistently.
Because they have a vested interest in legacy companies. 
"I don't ""hate"" Tesla, but I don't like how Tesla has a tendency to overinflate the positives of every product it puts out. Tesla likes to ""anchor"" it's product in an unrealistic expectation, people buy into that prediction as absolute truth, and then make up lame excuses when it's obviously not the case. For example, when these solar roofs were announced they were touted by Musk as costing the same as a traditional roof.

Obviously this is mostly bullshit. A solar roof is much more expensive to purchase than a traditional roof, and in order to break even, or even save money, you need to pay cash for your roof and utilize 30 years of solar power. If you finance the roof, or if you don't stay 30 years, or if there are energy variables 20 years down the road from now we can't predict, there's no chance it's ""the same price"". 

Instead of presenting an honest assessment of its product - that you are paying huge upfront costs for this luxury that can help pay for itself over time with energy savings, Tesla positioned its roof as the same cost as a traditional roof. That's bullshit. 

I'd rather the company be honest and embrace the fact that it's products are not cost-for-cost the same as traditional competition.

I understand why they do it. It puts Tesla in people's minds as the forefront of all these developing product markets, even if Tesla isn't necessarily actually at the front of the race. That sort of bullshit leaves a bad taste in people's mouths, especially since Tesla likes to claim they ""love competition"" but rarely actually put action behind that mission statement (see for instance, superchargers). "

They told us full autonomous. No full autonomous.
Because they spend far more money than they make. 
"

Don't panels last 20-25 years?  Will you even be in the same house?  And unless your roof itself needs replacement, just replacing the panels is a real simple and relatively low cost task.  The racking, wiring and inverter are already there.  You probably wouldn't even need to get a building permit to replace panels.  Just buy a shipment of panels from someone like https://www.wholesalesolar.com/  .    Unplug and remove the old panels, install and connect the new panels.  "
"Most ‚Äúlifetime‚Äù warranties for regular roofing materials (asphalt, tile, etc) actually cap between 50-75 years. That being said, as long as the wood decking is properly sealed from the outside, and as long as humidity is controlled within the attic and the house is properly insulated, wood rot should be minimal and take longer than 50 years. If the wood decking does manage to rot or become damaged, this would not be considered a warranty issue as it is a failure of the underlayment, not the tiles.

You cannot just backfeed solar into the grid without utility permission. They must approve the design and must be installed to their standards.
"This is true of all solar roofs, I believe. The power company has to approve anything that is going to be feeding power into their network, mostly for safety reasons. In Maryland it took my utility a few months to approve my SolarCity system and swap out my meter for one that could run backwards when needed."
"You also need to have the utility install a net-metering...meter. I just had solar installed too, but my home has a typical meter. Meaning it doesn't backtrack, and any power fed back into the grid is counted as power used. So my power company (Duke) needs to install the new meter and also provide approval on the install."

Would you not be able to have the builders just not do the roofing and have tesla or whoever to waltz in and do it?
Nvidia money...
On the topic of how it looks you should know there are four different styles to choose from
cut down trees to help go green! Shading the sun with a tree may actually produce more energy savings than the solar tiles being blocked
I bet it won't even take 20 years. Give it 5
"Solar panels are pretty simple really.  No moving parts, really low failure rate.  You should read up on it since you appear to be confused."
solarcity is owned by Tesla
"Tesla bought them, and are converting the branding to Tesla Power."
Tesla acquired Solar City.
"Follow up questions: the kwp depends on roof size rather than power usage needs?

watt rating of individual tiles?

What inverters are used?

How does is the system affected by shading?  Are optimizers/microinverters used?

The Tesla website seems quite quiet on these important points. "

"If you don't need a new roof, yeah. But if you are replacing a roof anyway, then it makes more sense. "
"Yes. It‚Äôll cost $20k+

They say it‚Äôll cost less than an equivalent roof. 

Keyword? ‚ÄúEquivalent‚Äù

An equivalent roof would be slate tiled or terra-cotta which are fucking expensive. "
"A local roofer quoted me $12K for a new 25 year roof.

The Tesla website estimates $36.5K.

Granted, their roof will also generate almost $10k in profit over the initial costs over 30 years, but it's a significant difference in capital."
"I did the math. My house would cost $75,000 for a solar roof. 

The payback does not work unless you are in a high cost of utility state. "

Can't you say that about anything lmao
"148,900 for roof. 158,000 savings over 30 years. My goodness, impossible to afford."
I‚Äôm assuming $25 of roof surface area right
I think they were looking at cost minus savings over time will equal the cost of a typical roof. The cost per month of roof is more than my monthly power bill!
"Yeah, I think the price needs to cut in half for it to be economical in Ohio anyway. We are not exactly a beacon for sunshine. My roof will also spend a good four weeks of the year covered in snow."
"That is a good point

Elon should make aggressive internal timelines, without preaching it to Twitter"
I think a lot of Tesla haters are actually just hipsters who hate it because a lot of other people like it.
"If you compare these solar roofs that Tesla is currently installing to the equivalent non-solar roof... they are actually very close to the same cost. To be clear the equivalent non-solar roof is a damn expensive roof. Lol. So technically they are not exaggerating. The issue is that the general public does not realize how much it cost to buy a really good roof for a house. They're used to buying fairly cheap roofs that have to be replaced very often. The same can be said for cars. People are used to buying, well, frankly... Cheap shity cars. 

It's also important to point out that Elon Musk kind of lives in the future a little bit. When you look at the kinds of Rapid progress that we've seen with SpaceX and with Tesla sometimes the timeline is only off by a year or two but the numbers themselves on the S curve look abysmal. This is particularly true when you're within year one or two of the S curve. So at the beginning of the S curve it makes Musk look  embarrassingly wrong. But the same can be said on the other side of the S curve once adoption has gone beyond something like 50%. People usually underestimate technological dominance of the s-curve once you get past early adopters. 

Solar roofs will be technologically dominant in most of Earth's populated areas. Just as EV semis, trucks, sports cars, sedans, taxis will be. 

The same will likely be true for StarLink, Boring Company, NeuraLink, SpaceX etc... It's what Elon Musk does best. He picks the tech that is the most likely to win and become dominant. He might be off by a year or two, but in the grand scheme of things that's negligible. Its also frustrating.





"
Then explain why is it rated among the top ten company to work by the employees.

*No full autonomous yet. FTFY.
That doesn't say much about a company. Why would it make you dislike them of all things? I can see it making someone think they won't succeed though.
"That's how most large tech startups are. You have to spend money to make money and sometimes you don't turn a profit for years. If Elon's vision pans out, Tesla will be rolling in money in a decade."
Current panels are 10 years old.  I've been in the house 15.  Don't see us leaving anytime soon.  Especially since I plan to retire in 15 when we are done paying for the house.
Got it. So it's basically a final inspection that the install has to go through.
Hopefully this is able to be mainstream as fuck eventually. Then we will be able to pool electricity for our neighborhoods.
There's the matter of distribution impact as well. If the system will produce 12 kW AC but the home is served by a 10 kVA transformer then the system will need to be downsized or the transformer swapped out (often at customer expense after months of waiting).
Makes sense. Thanks for the info!

"Unless the tiles have anti-aliased edges from the factory, this is still potato quality."
Only if your new roof is crazy expensive. Replacing my asphalt roof with it would have been 5x pricier. 
We had a hail storm and are getting a new roof. Are they installing these in Texas yet? 
Yea my roof needs to be done in a few years.  The tesla roof was 70k. For a 1300 sq ft house.
"I still don't get why you Yanks use shitty asphalt tile roofing instead of colourbond steel or concete tile. Is it something to do with snow?

My concrete tile roof is nearly 40 years old and still fine (repainted and resealed about 6 years ago)."
And what if you already have solar? I have a old roof ready to be replaced but I also have solar panels that are only a few years old. Will the roof pay for itself in my lifetime considering the marginal improvement in electric generation over/in addition to my standard panels?
"These numbers don‚Äôt make any sense. They say 12000 miles per year and 300kwh/mile. It‚Äôs 300wh/mile and I‚Äôm not sure what $0.22 hWh is. But I pay 12 cents/kWh. 

So, 12000 miles/year is $432 or $864 for both cars. Not $1584. I guess they could have a bigger house than I do and live in a desert. But my August a/c was 336kwh in the Midwest and that is the highest month. 

I guess it‚Äôs possible that wherever they live electricity costs 22 cents/kWh and all these numbers get way larger. But the units still make zero sense. 

I drive a Nissan Leaf and spent a grand total of $1142 on electricity last year. House car and everything. 

I have a home energy monitor that tells me what I use and which appliance is using it. Last year I used 9516kwh which tracked perfect with my utility. "
"If you're paying extra in solar, but it doesn't contribute to extra KwH, you're adding to the initial investment without additional returns. Selling power to the grid for a credit on power used when the panels aren't collecting can help lower costs. The battery solution works if you need to be off grid, or your utility provider doesn't pay you for/allow excess power to the grid.

Using excess power to produce another form of power to be used at a later time (renewable natural gas, electrolyzing hydrogen, charging a battery array). These are ways to help justify solar investments,"
You can say that about some insanely expensive things I suppose 
No.. what the hell? 
Huh. I'm disappointed. 
"From what I read, there were heating elements in the tiles to melt off snow?"
I'd be interested in seeing what the PV Watts estimate would be for your place compared to usage. 
"The timelines are never internal-only. It doesn't work that way. Read their quarterly reports, and you'll understand. Because they're a public company they have to have consistency between what they tell their investors, their suppliers, and their employees.

If it does and it is of consequence then suppliers and shareholders may try to sue. "

"More like a second final inspection. Final inspection first for the city's building and saftey. Then utility will look at it and make sure it is within their guidelines. Also they will check to see if the system is within your usage(depending on utility). Hopefully this is done in parallel with the city permits because it would suck to have utility say you can't turn on for whatever reason then having to redo city inspections again for changes.  But in short yes it is basically a final inspection without actuslly going to the site, they just look at your drawings and stuff."

"Yeah, it really is prohibitively expensive up front, unless you already have disposable money in the six figures burning a hole in your pocket.  It would have been like $8k to replace my mom‚Äôs roof with asphalt.  It was upwards of $70k to do her roof with Tesla + the cost of the power wall or whatever.

Edit:  see [here](https://i.imgur.com/t5d0fm6.jpg) for the cost at 40% solar tiles and [here](https://i.imgur.com/vzNg8LO.jpg) for the cost at 70% solar tiles.

Edit 2:  before someone calls me out for it, I realize Tesla roof is far from asphalt shingles.  Slate roofing is the higher end roof, costing about $20/sq ft on the low end.  So if we put that roof on my mom‚Äôs house, it would be about $52k on the low end with no return.  Safe to say that Tesla isn‚Äôt trying to make this a available-for-all roofing solution.  "
It's better to think of it in terms of a new roof + traditional solar panels.
Yeah I was trying to do this a few months ago and had Tesla come out to give me a quote. A 30-year singles roof and solar is still much cheaper and a lot clearer on how much energy you'll generate.
"So you're at $30,000 for my house.

Our power bill averages around $200/ mo.

200x12=$2400/ year.


So 12.5 years for ROI and it's life is, what, 10 years?

..and I think these things are actually twice that."
"Well, yes, that is/was the idea from day 1. These shingles will likely never be on par with an asphalt roof. You're splurging for an incredible product. If you'd like a rough estimate, take the square footage of your roof and multiply it by 21.50. From there you will have a rough idea how much it will cost. "
"i hate comparisons like this. oh yea i'm going to get a new car. i'll get an echo or some shit then say a model 3 is 5x as expensive. an asphalt roof is not even close to how good a tesla tile roof is. for one, the tile is almost indestructible. two, they are also solar panels. "
I feel like that wouldn't be very cost effective to be honest.
It would take enormous amounts of energy to melt several inches of snow. Whether or not it would be worth it depends on how long that batch of snow would sit there if you did nothing. And how sunny it would be... which it is typically ‚Äúnot‚Äù when there is snow on the ground here. 
"Google's Project Sunroof estimates that I'd need a 10kW system on my roof, which costs $26k (for normal panels) and would take 20 years to pay itself back. I can't imagine the Tesla roof, which costs more than panels, paying itself back at all at current prices (on my roof in Ohio)."
"Exactly it is a catch-22

Elon just pushes insanely aggressive timelines, as he always does, which got him this far, but it doesn't always happen

They gotta get that price down. Middle class America can‚Äôt afford to buy two houses. Here in the Midwest, most people live in something that costs no more than $130k and they might have 2000 square feet of floor space."
"The real problem isn't just the upfront cost, it's actually the running cost (in a way).

Asphalt vs solar roof, for pretty much any size, will heavily favor the asphalt roof if you invest the money saved into a low risk index fund. My back of the envelope calculation shows a minimum of $100 more per month in returns from the saved money invested over the solar roof, and that gap only grows. Even if you factor in replacing your asphalt roof every 10 years the solar roof still loses. "
"I was quoted $12K to replace my roof with asphalt, and Solar roof price was $55k(70%). I really wanted to get the solar roof, but my roof had hail damage and I couldn't wait for Tesla. 

Also how big is your house?. Mine is 3700sqft and for 70% coverage its showing me $55k just for the roof. $85k seems like you have a huge roof. 

"
Damn that's pricy. I still think I'll do my next home with them though. I do all the construction myself so just about everything I'll save going that route will go into installing the solar tile.
"Yeah, I just redid my roof a few years back for like $10k and it would have been half the cost of my home, left on the mortgage, to do it with Tesla tiles.

While it would eventually pay for itself, I'm on natural gas which isn't that expensive at all.  If I was planning on dying here then I'd of pulled the trigger but I just can't see myself paying so much when the difference could save even more money on fixing up the inside of the home."
"I am pretty disappointed with Tesla in the solar department... Solar city was supposed to be super cheap and great for consumers..

An 8kw system should cost no more than $8-10k by now, and should pay for itself. It should be sold alongside the cars to make fully sustainable homes, that's the whole solution in two essential steps.. the powerwall is not super helpful in areas where you can sell to the grid."
And if you are looking to turn a flat roof to a pitched add a few more 10 Ks to that! 
The net cost is higher over 30 years than their estimate for the cost of a traditional roof up front. They are basically telling you it‚Äôs a horrible investment in their quote lol
"In my area we either get a ""feed in tariff"" which is about a third to a quarter of the retail electricity price, or we can join a Virtual Power Plant and participate in the wholesale market. Our electricity supply is also quite reliable, so we wouldn't need as many batteries, and in my case our energy consumption is low ‚Äî so one battery will be enough to cover the expected blackouts and trade on the wholesale market.

For my place, a Tesla Solar Roof plus battery will probably pay for itself inside 15 years (but we don't have pricing available yet in Australia). That's still a long time to be living in one house, with an average of 5 years between house changes, though we've already been here 10 and have no intention of moving any time soon.

Exactly. Solar means the utility company loses money. In California we have net metering so excess power is paid back to the customer in terms of credit. I've heard at the end of the year some utility will give you a check if you don't use your credits. Not 100% sure. But we have net metering for sure.

"No joke.

The calculator is on their website.  You put in the address and it estimates the roof size or something and calculates it.  They also flaunt the price being the same as asphalt (after like 30 years of electricity savings)."
"It is continuing Tesla's strategy of capitalizing on the impatience of early adopters. Just like their cars, where they first released a $$$ Roadster, and now they are prioritizing the orders for the most expensive versions of the Model 3. They'll easily get enough orders from cashed up early adopters that will eat up all they can supply for now.

Then in a couple of years, after Tesla improves manufacturing processes and drives down costs, they'll drop their prices and hit (the upper end of the) mainstream. That's what they've done with every product launch. "
It really is more of a value-add for a refinance. So you‚Äôre only paying an additional amount on your mortgage while simultaneously saving the same or more off your electric bill so it‚Äôs possible to actually save you money instead of cost you money. You can also deduct the mortgage debt from your taxes thus saving even more money.

Pretty sure this isn‚Äôt for middle class America. Not for many years at least 
"You have to understand that there's a multi billion dollar industry for semi-permanent roofing in the hotter, sunnier parts of the US. Clay and cement tile is a market totally independent of asphalt roofing. The Tesla tiles *annihilate* the cost of such a roof when power production is factored in. In no way are they competing with asphalt.

Clay tiles make sense in climates with high winds and no snow. "
"> Here in the Midwest, most people live in something that costs no more than $130k and they might have 2000 square feet of floor space.

Wow midwest pricing is nice. We are selling my grandfathers house right now in CT on half an acre and 1,400sqft for $220k. It's also the reason I'm moving from CT to NC soon, stuff is too expensive here."
True but the Midwest isn't where most people in the US live. Where I live an 800 sqft 1 bedroom townhouse is around $300k. If someone were to replace the roof on something like that than they could much more reasonably consider these options.
this is the first iteration.
"It‚Äôs the first wave of this type of tech. The initial version will always be more expensive and tailored to the wealthy, only after it is around and used will the R&D help enough to lower the cost."
"Also if you are trying to calculate electric savings, it might be smaller than you expect.

"They're just beginning though, the model S definetely wasnt for the average middle class american but now we have the model 3.

"
Bigger issue is falling costs. If 3 years from now the price falls in half then it is best to wait and save thousands of dollars. If you buy early then you won't be able to recoup the cost if you sell the house. 
The quotes I showed in the pictures of my computer (I‚Äôm at work) are for an approximately 2600 sq ft roof based on Google‚Äôs solar project estimate or something (check the fine print on the left)
Sq ft of house doesn‚Äôt really count. My in laws have a 1900sq ft house and their new roof was more expensive than the one for my 3000 sq ft house. All roofs aren‚Äôt the same
"Actually, the $80k is for the roof alone.  Powerwalls are separate, but the anticipated tax credit reduces overall cost significantly by $25kish"

>If we ever colonize Mars and all we will take is our stupidity and selfishness then better don't do that. 

this is also meaningless. nobody said that's what we're taking to mars, least of which stupidity. that would be impossible seeing as how we're going to mars."
"> Solar means the utility company loses money.

I just want to ask for a point of clarification. When you feed energy back into the grid, the utility isn't losing money, are they? Utilities buy energy from providers, so when you pay your electric bill, you're paying for the power (from the energy generators) and the delivery (from the utility). So when you feed energy back to the grid, someone else is using that energy and paying the utility for it. You're just becoming an energy generator. At least, that's the way it's set up where I live."
I wasn't aware that any utility had a say over the size of your array though. Power needs for a home can differ based on the owners. How would a company correctly determine what is right sized and what is oversized?
Well then can‚Äôt you just disconnect yourself from the grid and run only on solar and battery backups?
"Sorry, what is your point here? You said the model 3 was useless and I said that there was plenty of uses for a car and somehow you thinking providing an alternative counters that?         That's like saying a Sony TV is useless because you could buy a Samsung instead. What..."
"Iirc, their trial is just in Phoenix Arizona for now, so you will need a car for quite some while "
"Because they‚Äôre too slow at producing. Ideal would be to keep up with demand, wouldn‚Äôt it be?  So yeah, it‚Äôs still a problem for them"
"The idea of 30 years of savings is so far off to me it's not even funny. By the time I settle into my career and get my first little house I'll probably move at least once before I have kids, and probably twice more later in life. Hell, I'm already 29, I probably won't ever spend 30 years in the same house.

But it's not like I could get that average house, slap a solar roof on it, and sell it for $40k above average home prices in that neighborhood because nobody would buy it.

Fortunately I've got a few years to wait and hopefully the prices are slashed by then."
and presumably with a 3 percent inflation factors every year
I'd have to live to be almost 90 **and** stay in my house for it to pay off. I can't see both of those things happening.

What's the website?
I work in the roofing industry and from day one I knew they weren't going to be anywhere close to asphalt pricing. Did no one else notice in all the videos they showed it was comparing them to slate and tile?
"It uses your address to find the sun coverage of that particular location, not the roof size."
"Yup. This is Elon's strategy from the beginning, and he isn't secretive about it. 

It shocks me this still shocks people."
"I ran the calculator for my house and that is what it looks like it would roughly be for me.  $50-55k to cover 50% of my roof with the solar tiles (blanks for the remainder) and a PowerWall... roughly $130/mo and that is roughly my average electric bill (of course, my electric rate is actually higher for the region because my electric company has ‚Äúscale‚Äù issues)."
Pretty sure the Model 3 is aimed directly at them.
In Finland most nicer houses have clay tiles and we have snow. Another popular alternative is aluminium but asphalt shingles really aren‚Äôt. It‚Äôs something you‚Äôd put on a summer house maybe.

"Where in CT can you even buy anything for $220k?

I thought most of CT was about $350-500 per sq ft? (ignoring the super expensive areas like Greenwich which is closer to $1k) So that means your house should more likely cost around $500-700k?"
"It depends on neighborhood but yeah it‚Äôs usually cheaper. I sold my old house on 1/4 acre and 1,800 sqft for $124k. Your land would be nice but idk about $100k nice."
"Probably if you buy land in the country, yeah."
Omaha _isn't_ rural midwest?
"Omaha is one of few good-sized cities in Nebraska though. Here in Ohio suburbs it might be (surprisingly) easier. Relatively new construction is another story, of course. Your average 80s suburb isn't bad at all."
"This is correct you have to take into account the pitch of the roof when measuring the square footage. Then you have to add at least 10-15% waste for all the shingles that will have to be cut up to account for a number of ridges and valleys. Price for installation takes into account squares, pitch, and height of the roof. The higher and steeper the longer and more dangerous it is."
Hooley dooley. That's an expensive roof >.<
"Not really, when you calculate in electrical savings I pay $100 per month for electricity. That‚Äôs $1200 a year. That‚Äôs around 50 years to make up for the difference if I use only solar to power my house. I also live in Washington state so not really that much sun. 

What am I missing here? "
"Net metering is the issue. The utility may be buying power at 4.3 center per kwh, and selling at 12. When you bet meter, they give you a 12 credit and charge someone else 12. That doesn't account for upkeep, maintenance, etc. Therefore they lose money. "
"Basically, your feeding in at prime time, highest rate. You usually take back out at night, lowest rate. Though in the winter it could also be prime rate during the day where your not producing as much as you're using."
They base it on your yearly use. If you built a system that's twice the size of your yearly use. Then they would say something but if it's slightly over they probably wouldn't. Though some utilities will only allow exactly 100%
I'm not entirely sure what the laws are in California. But I remember an article about some lady who got sued by a utility company for disconnecting. Apparantly there was a law that required you to be connected. I don't remember what state. But in theory yes you can run solar with backup and wouldn't need utility's permission. But you would still need to have it inspected or you can do it under the radar. Technically you can install your own solar but size it so it won't over produce. Then utility would never actually find out unless they see the panels or note your bill suddenly dropped 80% or so. Wouldn't recommend it though. I don't think it's practical to disconnect from grid with net metering in place in California. 
"Mostly dangerous, useless for people that want to be nearly sure they won't be responsible for others' death."
No need for 4 wheeler
"Yes it would be ideal to keep up with demand but unless you know a way for them to ramp up overnight, that's not going to happen for awhile.  And until they get through a lot of the backlog, sales isn't going to be super critical."
"Need to see how it impacts resale value. If you can get an extra $30k due to the roof it in essence lowers the cost of the roof by $30k to you. Still expensive, but the 30 year window shouldn't be the reason not to get it.

edit: fwiw I would only get a Solar Roof if there was bad hail damage in my area and my insurance was chipping in to replace the roof. "
The average American moves every 5-7 years. So honestly I don‚Äôt ever seeing it to be worth while financially or even resell wise. Yeah going green is cool but if you live in the Midwest especially there‚Äôs a good chance you don‚Äôt have that kind of cash to just do what ever with. 
"> The idea of 30 years of savings is so far off to me it's not even funny.

One thing to keep in mind though for whatever home improvement you make (bathroom, kitchen, solar panels, whatever...) is that when you sell your house you recover some of your investment (usually). Homes with improvements typically sell quicker and for more money than similar-sized homes. So you don't have to live in a home the whole time to recover the cost of, say, a more efficient water heater.

That said, a Tesla solar roof is still wwaaaay too expensive."
"But maybe it would end up adding that value once people are more educated? 360 months x $100 = $36,000. That's certainly not insignificant. It might be equivalent to one free mortgage payment every year."
Also money saved on getting normal roof will provide a better return than the energy cost savings.This product is simply too expensive to be competitive from financial standpoint and needs some creative accounting to reach any parity with standard tech
They're comparing it to '30-year' duroid shingles
You‚Äôd also be better off investing that money into bonds for 30 years.  At 5% a year you‚Äôd quadruple your money.
Why do you plan on moving so much?
Why?  Do you think the same house would kill you?  Is your only chance of survival to leave it?  Sounds like a death house.
Correct.  But after 30 years you‚Äôre getting your moneys worth I guess... the warranty is lifetime of the house or ‚Äúinfinity‚Äù

"That‚Äôs awesome to hear, thanks for running the numbers!"
Base model is just out of it.
It's a tiny house built in the fifties. [Here's a link](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/14-Maplewood-Ln-Northford-CT-06472/58934412_zpid/) to his house.
You could probably do $120k if you went to Bridgeport...
"Oh yeah, That's specifically why I'm leaving CT actually is the land. I live on 3 acres now which is nice, but I want *a lot* more so the plan is to head down to NC and get some gorgeous mountain views."
"Dang, that‚Äôs like 60$ a square foot, I didn‚Äôt know it was possible to build that cheap any where. Everyone I talk to says it‚Äôs 110 to 200 a square foot"
"Ha ha ha, no. "
"Omaha is the ONLY city to be living in unless you're a college student here!

You make an excellent point, nobody here would think it worth it to install a solar roof at that price point. Especially since the ROI would be much longer than the southwest. [See this map] (https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/images/charts/map_csp_national-large.gif).

I wonder if we could achieve total renewable by offering a large federal tax rebate to those southwestern areas. Only
> [0.6 percent of America's total land area] (https://solar.gwu.edu/how-much-land-would-it-take-power-us-solar)

would need to be covered, make it all solar roofs!"
"you're missing the fact that if you wanted solar, you would need to attached something big and ugly on your roof and that this is for people who can afford something that looks this good? this is the first gen of the tiles, so it's expensive. nobody said joe schmo can afford it. joe schmo couldnt afford a roadster or model s neither. people are still buying in droves because tesla is the first company to do it and they'll get all the demand available. "
This is pretty much it. Also the more people who gets solar the more it gets fed back. So they really don't want to pay everyone to produce if they don't need to.
But this is not a universal fact. It depends on the jurisdiction. It's up to the utilities/politicians to create an equitable system. Some have. Other's apparently haven't.
utility companies would very much prefer to take 10% off peak and move it to off hours.
What are good ways to stop overproduction if you aren't connected to the grid? I don't know much about this field but logic would lead me to just hooking up the system to a strong resistor. Should go through thousands of watts effortlessly
"Can you provide a source for increased Tesla injury/fatality rate? This seems counterintuitive to me, at least. Also that's still not the definition of useless."
that's a whole different debate :)
"The problem is you are not going to find a lot of people willing to pay that premium unless there's something else special about the house such as location or whatever.  They just move on to the next house that's for sale.  

I would love to have solar but it's to lo big of a risk if you have to sell the house.  If I lease... what if I can't find anyone who wants to buy the house and take on the lease?  What if I have to get the solar lease cancelled and the panels removed just to get the damn house sold?  Just too much of a risk to get locked into or spend money on if I wasn't rich as fuck."
"As a realtor, roofs dont have a return on investment. I imagine a tesla-roofed house would go pretty fast."
"And also only if you'd be able to have the solar roof right away, which won't happen for another few years at least. "
Came here to say this. 
"There's also a bit of a time factor on this too. A bathroom that was remodeled 15 years ago isn't going to get the same as a modern remodel. Heated pools are super nice, but 20 years ago it was quite a bit more expensive than they are now. 

The price of solar power is a fraction of what it was in 2008 and in 2008 it was a fraction of what it was in 1998. In 10 years, a new system might not even cost the example of 30k. "
It‚Äôs usually quicker OR for more money. 
"It‚Äôs not about being educated, it‚Äôs about where people who can afford that extra money are willing to live. For that much money you can get a better house in a nicer neighborhood with a better school district, etc. Basically, nobody would be willing to spend that much for anything in that particular neighborhood."
"You're not factoring in interest on money saved if you don't get the solar roof. Money today is always worth more than money tomorrow. 

A $10k asphalt roof vs a $70k solar roof. $60k saved. Put it in a low risk index fund and you'll beat the solar roof in monthly payout unless electricity is really expensive. "
If I do it right I can make money on resale and step up to better houses or neighborhoods. It doesn‚Äôt always work out that way but the investment aspect of houses is something not enough people pay attention to.
No we have already been here 25 years. Once the kids are out we aren't likely to stay another 30. 
Thank you!
"and they keep pushing it off making many suspect they never intended to sell them, at least not in volume"
I don't think they have in mind the same type of generators you'd be installing on people's roofs.
"Look up presidential trilam they are top of the line asphalt and are the replacement of tile in most hoas they are usually about $130 per square (100 sq ft of roofing) for just the material. Most comp is around $70 a square but you don‚Äôt need the special starter and ridge that is required by presidential. I see what you mean if you don‚Äôt want big solar panels on your roof this is another option but again the solar panels plus my nice roof would still be cheaper for me over these. 

You can‚Äôt really compare it with the model S as it is way beyond anything that is comparable. "
It's actually alot easier than that just make a smaller system than you actually need.  If you use 1500kwh a month. Create a system that produces say 1000. You pay your utility for the remaining 500. Though most utility would get suspicious about why your bill is suddenly so low. Also I wouldn't recommend creating your own pv system. It is extremely unsafe and you could burn your house down.
"Not talking about Tesla specifically, any four wheel vehicle sub-level-5"
"The lease is pretty easy stuff, its almost a no brainer. Basically no upfront cost and a lower electricity bill, I cant imagine many people wouldnt jump at that if they were looking to buy your house."
"Roofs might not, but have a solar powered home?  That is the real reason the value of the home would increase... the buyer would be expecting a lower to non-existent electric bill."
"For sure. I wasn‚Äôt saying one would get 100% back in their home improvements by selling. From what I remember reading on average, a new kitchen recovers 70% of initial investment when you sell."
"Yeah there are plenty of sleazy ‚Äúcash 4 homes‚Äù companies that will underpay and buy your home quickly.

But if you do some home upgrades that put you ahead of similar-sized homes in the area your place will sell quicker AND for more money."
"Yeah, that totally depends on a lot of factors. Houses in my city range from $500-2 million, and it's just a normal city in Canada. $50k or whatever is not going to get you a better school district. They would pay extra for a mortgage because after being educated, they know that they're going to SAVE money on electricity every single month, so they are not actually spending $50k more."
"I guess, I just enjoy building a family in one place and making memories there."
"I was just making a joke because the way you said it made it sound like you didn‚Äôt think both could happen (meaning one or the other could, but not both) versus you not thinking either could happen.  Sorry.  It wasn‚Äôt that funny.

For what it‚Äôs worth, I hope you can make it to 90!"
"my thought exactly, I was promised a $35K car on day one in store... I havent been able to buy it yet. "
"Residential windmills are ugly imo, would be cool if they could integrate it into the house but honestly not windy enough here for that "
Ok fair enough. I agree that self driving can bee much safer than any human driven car.
Having solar on a lease is terrible for selling a house. Expect to buy the system before selling or take the cost of the system off the price of the house.
The general buying public cares more about the kitchen than the roof.
That‚Äôs the way I grew up! I‚Äôll take what I get but marriage and kids aren‚Äôt even on my radar yet.
"haha, gotcha. Yeah I made it sound like something out of a bad movie. ""They didn't get out in time..."""
Why is that?
Kitchen does not pay the electricity bill though... 
"Ahh, it's what I enjoy but I understand everybody wants something different."
"no-one wants to own a house that doesn't include a roof (you just leased your roof to a third party) and the Tesla/solar city lease is a terrible financial decision as you could have bought the system for less (get a loan and you get the tax credit and all the savings), and that bad decision is now tied to the house. Basically it is a red flag and complicates the house buying and selling process.

I own my own solar array and even then it adds little value to my house."
Financing an extra $30k translates to roughly $150 more a month in your house payment though...
"Interesting, thanks for explaining"
"No problem, I do solar for a living and the Tesla/Solar City lease has definitely shown itself to be a bad idea for the consumer. They are pushing it less now, but it has turned many solar professionals into Tesla skeptics."
"To be fair... when a Ferrari crashes, the headline is ""A Ferrari Crash"""
"Weird. When mercedes offers a new lower cost model it's hardly news at all but when Tesla starts offering a lower cost model it's news everywhere.  
Publicity goes both ways. Tesla generates clicks it doesn't matter if it's good or bad news. "
When Fedex reserves 20 Tesla semis it's frontpage news. When Fedex orders any other semi no one will even mention it. Being a company that lives on hype and PR goes both ways.

And so on and so on ... Everything that is interesting gets mentioned by name or brand. Tesla ist just very interesting so it gets mentioned a lot.

The funny thing for me is that the media wants to paint a bad picture on Tesla but the amout of ""crash news"" is staggeringly low compared to ""car crash"" numbers. So far i've never sat in a Tesla but i am pretty sure i would be at least as safe if not safer in a Tesla then in my Volkswagen Golf.

"Unfortunately, all cars with autonomous systems  are under a microscope now because of what happened with Uber. Since Tesla markets their systems as ‚Äúautopilot‚Äù the attention is warranted. It‚Äôs the price companies pay for being on the bleeding edge. The cult of personality surrounding Elon Musk doesn‚Äôt help either. "
How can this shitpost get so many upvotes? I'm disappointed at this subreddit.
"Another Tesla fan who thinks it's them against the world. Tesla gets tons of free positive coverage and it's bound to create some negative coverage too. Media knows mentioning the word Tesla sells - positive or negative. If you can't get that simple theory, I feel sorry for you.

Btw, I would love to own a Tesla car someday and send conventional cars to the museum but I at least can see things without being blinded."
"Exactly, remember that autonomous car that killed a woman last week in Arizona?

I find that Uber-suspicious!"
It's the same if it's a Lambo or Ferrari crashed. Are you that surprised?

If the Tesla is driving then the correct headline would be the Tesla crashed 
"Any crash featuring a potentially unsafe car aka the Pinto, Ford Fiesta, etc. is given that label too. "
"Much like the current news on the pedestrian death from the DRIVERLESS UBER CAR that has dominated the headlines simply because it was a DRIVERLESS UBER CAR. I recall a few years ago a single car fire on a highway causing debate because it was an ELECTRIC CAR OMG but apparently in the US there's a car fire every 2 mintues killing one person every 24 hours, but since they're petrol cars it doesn't make the news. "
"When you buy a Tesla you say ""I got a Tesla"", not, ""I got a new car"". I think it goes both ways."
There are about [100 people dying from car crashes in US every single day](http://asirt.org/initiatives/informing-road-users/road-safety-facts/road-crash-statistics). How many of those are in news at all?
Is this stock dive because of the crash? My jaw dropped when I checked it this morning. 
I‚Äôm fine with this. I want fatal Tesla crashes to be as rare as plane crashes. And I want the same level of scrutiny.
"It's the cost of heavily advertising the ""autopilot"" feature."
"When Prius gas peddles we're sticking, or Firestone tires were exploding on Ford's, or expeditions steering wheels were failing, all by name.  Every single one. "
"It's not wierd. When a Koenigsegg crashes it's also the same. I know Koenigsegg is more expensive and rare, but Tesla is still a fairly new and uncommon car compared to many other brands. You won't see headlines when Toyota Corolla crashes, but will see it when Ferraris crash etc. If/when Tesla becomes more common, i'm certain this will go away."
Maybe it's because you guys have been saying for years that a Tesla is not a traditional car
"Did they just admit that Teslas are so superior to other automobiles, they can't be called cars?"
"you're wrong. it's brand becomes important when it's an expensive car. you can read so many super car car crashes online and even that old meme about ferrari when they kept burning down.

the whole autonomous thing also puts tesla under more scrutiny. just a dumb thread to start "
"Weird, same thing happens to other exotic cars like Ferraris and Lamborghinis because they are rare or new compared to other cars..."
Imagine if every carmaker lost 10bil in market cap after each car accident? Either cars would be safe as fuck by now or we would all be on horse back again. 
"""Ferrari crashed"" "
"""My iPhone"" / ""My phone"""
"Ford,Chevy,Toyota etc can't/dont drive themselves. Auto pilot is the main reason Tesla makes headlines. If Tesla didn't have that system their crashes wouldn't make headlines."
"When you are a company with a ridiculous amount of public interest and exposure, you can't really expect to just reap the benefits without getting the negatives as well."
"It‚Äôs responding to consumer demand... I want to know when it‚Äôs a Tesla because I‚Äôm an EV and SDC enthusiast. First I want to know was anyone hurt and then if Autopilot was involved. HOWEVER, I don‚Äôt want to know because i want the stock to tank, or because I want people to be fearful about SDCs. I want the tech to develop and I want Tesla and all other manufacturers to learn and grow their products in a responsible and safe way. SDCs and EVs will save millions of lives and extend our brief stay on this planet, they are awesome but we need to be aware of the good and the bad."
"Weird. When one car (that is extremely overhyped) of 200,000 crashes, it's ""a Tesla crashed"". When one car out of the other 30,000,000 crash, it's ""a car crashed""."
"Oh, you mean the *California* crash. I though you were talking about the stock price."
"Tesla is going bankrupt if you hold the stock get out. If you want to short Tesla stock this is your chance. 

Rating agency just published a report that say Tesla has no choice but raise capital again at least $2 billion. This will make the stock go down hard."
Almost like there's a prejudice or something...

When there is a fatality is Elon at fault or the driver.  If a robot kills a person is the manufacturer of the robot criminally responsible? Time will tell hence the stock tumble. 
You know you're pushing boundaries and challenging the norms when the media singles you out for an otherwise every day occurrence
"It‚Äôs not that weird. Tesla‚Äôs a new car company, and it‚Äôs the first car company to only make electric vehicles, and good ones at that. It‚Äôs an outlier car company that‚Äôs still new enough so that when one crashes, we can take a look at it to see how well it does compared to other brands. "

"This is what happens when new technology is so revolutionary that the establishment - whether it be government, media, industry, or just stodgy Boomers - have no idea what to make of it.

Shit is about to change in a real big way and Tesla has been brave enough to attack the system head-on. *This* is the reason the legacy manufacturers are reacting so slow. Not because they‚Äôre incapable (they‚Äôre way more capable than Tesla, that‚Äôs a fact) but because they *knew* what sort of backlash could occur and just say back while somebody else took the heat. The worlds biggest car manufacturers are currently performing a balancing act between producing this technology before Tesla locks in guaranteed market share and struggling through all the public backlash of new things not working.

"Back in its day, when a Horseless Carriage crashed it was a ""horseless carriage crash"" but when a horse-drawn carriage crashed, it was just ""a carriage crash"".  ;-)

Likewise, today when I ask the family, ""where's my phone"" they know I mean my cell phone.  10 years ago I'd have had to say ""my cell phone"" to differentiate it from my personal cordless land line phone in my home office.

The better comment should be,   
""When a Tesla crashes, it's ""a Tesla crashed"". When every other EV crashes, it's ""an electric car crash"".

An EV crash is still interesting to the public as being different from ICE car crashes, as people are still unsure what happens to the battery.  ~~Hollywood~~ History has shown us what happens to ICE cars enough.  

But if a Nissan Leaf crashes and the battery catches fire, is it as newsworthy as if a Tesla does?  IMO yes, but in reality it's not.  Tesla is uniquely positioned as both the media darling, and scapegoat."
"Interesting, isn‚Äôt it?

"When a Tesla crashes its rare, when a driver who is looking down on their phone and/ or is drinking kills another person it‚Äôs normal. Teslas deserve the recognition they are getting, other companies don‚Äôt offer quality/technology at the price Tesla is offering, especially in an electric car."
"NPR pissed me off this morning with that. They said that in the aftermath of the accident, ""Tesla's Model X is under investigation."" Not that the accident is being investigated but that there is some vast investigation into the entire model. NPR is usually good but that was some godawful reporting."
"IT's always like that. An autopilot killing one person, everyone loses their minds. A driver killing somebody by a stupid mistake an autopilot would have prevented, and nobody bats an eye, it happens like every other minute. Don't worry about it, it'll go away eventually. It was probably the same when cars were invented and it will be the same when spaceships become a thing."

Weird. When a company revolutionizes the sluggish auto industry and massively increases the rate of electrification it gets attention...hmm interesting. People love to hate change 
"It‚Äôll be interesting to me to see the response if they find no fault of Tesla but can‚Äôt find out whether autopilot was on or off.... That will tell us A LOT about the biases of the NHTSA and which direction regulation is heading. 

The crash is obviously terrible but this hypocrisy/double standard is amazing to watch. It has so much to do with perceived risk and not actual risk. 

Also has to do with writers getting off on having inflammatory headlines and articles instead of accurate, neutral ones. Oh well, such is the state of news these days. "
Mercedes and most luxury car brands are just selling their Image and selling cheaper cars devalues that.  People that don't want to be seen driving a cheap car and think it's a status symbol.

"I don't think it's really the same thing in this particular instance though. Companies ordering Tesla semi's makes front page news because the Tesla Semi is an industry disrupting product and heavy hitters in that industry dipping their toes into what will be the future is front page news because it marks a shift in that industry. The few other companies offering electric semi's i've seen make headlines when these companies order them as well. 

A Tesla having a car crash the same as any other car crash getting called out specifically as ""a Tesla crash"" rather than ""a car crash"" that otherwise would not get news coverage if it wasn't Tesla is not the same thing. It's not an example of hype/press working both ways. That's the portion of the media that doesn't like Tesla specifically targeting Tesla with forced bad press. If something about the recent accident is found to actually be the fault of an aspect of the car that is specific/exclusive to Tesla, then yeah by all means write all the bad Tesla blaming headlines you want, but that isn't the case yet calling press calling car crashes involving Teslas a ""Tesla crashed"" wrongfully, and heavily, implies these crashes are Tesla's fault. That isn't PR/press working the other way, that's basically slander."

What do you mean? Every single title says that it was Uber (company) and article mentioned Volvo as a car that was used. What company was not named?
"It's been only mentioned with regards to Tesla, from what I've seen.

Seems Tesla is taking a lot of bashing from all angles; even those that are unwarranted, at present."
I get that you're being sarcastic but I find you're proving OPs point. The headlines of the articles you provided portray Uber as the company responsible for the accident and only mention Volvo in the body of the article. If it were a tesla involved I feel like that would be mentioned in the headline as well and not just Uber

"Deaths from car crashes aren‚Äôt new. Deaths from car crashes in cars labeled ‚Äúself-driving‚Äù or ‚ÄúAutopilot‚Äù *are* new. Justifiable or not, although I think they‚Äôre putting the cart before the horse when they haven‚Äôt even confirmed AP was engaged on the MX that crashed.

The media has hyped self-driving cars as being jusbaround the corner, as making traditional cars obsolete within a few years. Why perhaps no one will own a car when you can just press a button on a smartphone and a self-driving car will arrive at your doorstep within minutes!

Now there are signs that the self-driving future is years away. This run counter to Tesla‚Äôs vision. This runs counter to at least some of he basis of Tesla‚Äôs valuation and mindshare.

Lastly, if I crash my Ford tomorrow and die, it‚Äôs likely my fault. If my Tesla Autopilot fails and I die, it might be Tesla‚Äôs fault.

People are realizing that self-driving, that even Autopilot might be exposing manufacturers to enormous liability."

"A few things are going on. 1) A large hedgefund head is claiming tesla will go bankrupt in 4 months, 2) Tesla' credit was recently downgraded by Moody's to B3 due to a slow TM3 ramp, and 3) NTSB is investigating the response to a crash and how to clean up Lithium batteries after a fire. 

IMO, a lot of this is overblown. NTSB will just come up with new guidelines, TM3 production is ramping up and will alleviate debt concerns, and eventually some big fund will label this a buying opportunity. "
"Not at all. No matter how much you like Tesla, it's hard to deny that their stock is extremely overvalued, on top of that they are in serious financial troubles.

See my point? Any expensive car can do that. That doesn't make Tesla better or worse than other brands "
Well obviously people would lose their mind. Autopilot is a new technology that could be great but could also be dangerous. That's why when a Tesla crashes people want to know if they can really trust this new technology. Also any expensive brand can make headlines if one of their cars crash. Although I can't believe people think this is something to brag about

"Surely the majority of drivers have seen some jerkoff in an Audi or BMW whipping around people in traffic. Crashes are an inevitably. When we see a crash, our brains say ""Yeah, that figures"". However, our brains are almost hard-coded to pay attention to anomalies. Teslas are still new and mysterious to most people so they want to click and see what happened. I bet that only a tiny fraction of the population have ever been in one, so they want to see what happened with this mysterious self-driving car. 

Now, if I saw a headline that said a Geo Metro was involved in a high-speed crash, I'm 100% clicking on that. "

I would be interested to see the hard numbers of hours/miles per crash of all the AI vs. humans. Yes I understand that the goal should be 0% but we will need to understand this could be slow even AI needs to learn we just want it to learn faster than us. The good thing is that we will not have to keep teaching new generations for eternity like we will with humans. Humans are getting worse at driving by the day.

"Wait wait wait, Mercedes has been practically THE advancing force in the automotive industry for 40 years. Is this satire?"
There's the ignorance of this sub I'm expecting. Right at the first comment 
Same goes for crashes.  They've been crashing for 20 years.  There's very little to learn from a Mercedes crash.  We're still learning about how cars with large batteries perform in crashes.  There's potentially even more to be learned if the car crashed while using Autopilot.  
Mercedes is leading the way in consumer accessible autonomous driving. 
"You should pay attention to all the recent breakthroughs in gasoline engines for fuel economy. Whether to compete with tesla or to make up for cafe laws making cars heavy or what not, all the major car companies are trying very very hard to make fuel efficiency as cheap as possible and not cost them too much reliability. Continuously Variable Transmissions, HCCI, Selective Cylinders, Variable Valve Timing, Turbos with smaller engines, Variable Stroke Size and of course, Honda and Toyota popularized and mass produced the hybrid.

Tesla should be able to tell if the autopilot was on or off right off the bat. All teslas are connected to internet right? Even if it is via your cellphone. 
"Its not official yet but from the comments Tesla made, it looks like autopilot was on. 

They talked about a barrier height and how it was significantly lower compared to how it was  and also how ""many tesla's used that road before without any issues"". This tells me that the autopilot was on and it tried to turn without seeing the divider (barrier) ."

"You can‚Äôt be an industry disrupting product without being in production first.

The Semi has the hype for now, and potential is all it has.

Meanwhile people pay extra scrutiny to Tesla accidents because they are the only company irresponsible enough to ship beta versions of safety critical features to their cars while being misleading about how much safer their cars are. There are many higher scoring cars when it comes to safety yet nobody write blogposts like Elon does.

If you talk a big game, you should be prepared for the scrutiny."
"> That's the portion of the media that doesn't like Tesla specifically targeting Tesla with forced bad press

I love Tesla, but I'm sorry that's just conspiracy nonsense.  Tesla is a company that people are simply more interested in than other car companies.  A Tesla crash in inherently more interesting than a Mercedes crash.

Add to that the fact that Tesla in more aggressive and public with their use of new/experimental technology.  Which recently had negative press  due to it's failure to save a driver's life (which I fully believe was his fault, but it still happened and showed a limit to the technologies abilities).

Add to that the fact that Uber just came under enormous scrutiny for recording the first autonomous vehicle death (in North America at least).  Tesla doesn't know the reason for this crash yet, but the media and public are reasonably sensitive to it possibly being another technology-related death.

Also, keep in mind that Tesla has actively worked to make their name a big story as often as possible, and even I will admit that in many cases it wasn't really deserved compared to the little media fanfare received by competitors for similar news.  Tesla has largely thrived on both hype and media/public obsession.  I don't think it is fair to cry foul when they get more than average attention for something like this."
Man this sub is straight tesla pr

"And here I was wondering what it meant for a self driving car to ""uber-kill"" someone..."
"Did you even click the hyperlink because the article's titled ""Woman killed by self-driving Uber car"""
"I'm certain that she was more visible than the potato quality video shows, both to the human eye and the car's more advanced cameras and sensors. Radar and Lidar can see in the dark, it seems clear that it was a failure of the autonomous systems, *and* of the safety driver (who wasn't watching the road)."
I'm following that story in r/urbanplanning the take on it there is (hyperbolic summary) that the people who designed that area where trying to murder pedestrians as some sort of sick hobby.
"He was being sarcastic, his link has Uber right in the title."
Whoosh
"That's because Uber does the self driving on that Volvo, and Tesla does the autopilot on Tesla.

The reason it is a story is because Tesla has not been able to confirm or deny whether Autopilot was engaged. If it was known from the  beginning that AP was NOT on, it wouldn't be a story. As proof I offer the many Tesla wrecks I have seen only in this sub, and never on the news."
"But in this case citing ""Uber"" over ""Volvo"" was fair. The self driving software (which thus far appears to be where the fault was) was entirely written by Uber, while all of the Volvo's features were disabled. So whether the car happened to be a Volvo or any other car was purely incidental."
"Maybe so. But why would that even be surprising? It's only natural that the new players (Uber, Tesla, Waymo or any Chinese car manufacturer) are under much stronger scrutiny than the well-established, proven manufacturers.

OP's notion of ""They're all out to get us!"" is just ridiculous. The media loves to accompany a business's (like Tesla) or a persons ascent, but they want to be there even more when they fall. Tesla is getting the good with the bad... just like everyone else."
Uber should have their testing licenses revoked IMO 
"There are 5 links in his comment, all with ""Uber"" in the title. How much more obvious can the sarcasm be?"
I don't understand your question.
"People would like to think so, but no, for as long as there is a steering wheel and a brake pedal, and you're in the driver seat, it's your fault if you run into a wall and die regardless whether Tesla technology fails or not."
How about the proportion
"1 in 37'000 or 0,0027%"
"Put it this way. Remington sells devices expressly for the purpose of killing. If you wrongfully kill someone with a Remington, you‚Äôre at fault. Not Remington.

If Remington built an AI turret for the purpose of identifying hostiles and the operational authority to kill them, and it kills wrongfully, Remington is at fault.

Tesla, no matter how it words its Autopilot agreement, is taking on liability. It has also stated it will deliver actual self driving with OTA. If it backs off that stance it‚Äôs potentially a huge black eye.

"
"We do target the big killers the hardest, but up to this point we had no way to prevent car crashes, just as we have no effective way to cure cancer yet.

About the 50 people die in mass shooting, you're correct that is not a big number but it's a big number per location and over a short period of time. That makes it a big killer.
"
"Source?

Edit: There has been 2 fatal crashes(correct me if Im wrong) and both were because of drivers negligence. Tesla has logged millions of miles with autopilot active. I'm pretty sure your 10x figure is wrong."
"That's true, although with the huge difference in miles driven the real number could be far off from the factor 10. I'm not saying it is, it just could be.

Also the technology is quite young. And you need to start at some point, or you will never achieve better overall safety. Some might argue the point in time is too early but my opinion is that the switch to electric cars and the reinventing of many car parts can go hand in hand with introducing autonomy.

I bet the numbers will equalize in very few years. "

It's done in slow motion so it's hard to tell the speed, but the description mentions Caltrans is doing the testing so I'd expect they were testing a highway barrier or something, which makes me think this is actually a high speed crash test, which you don't see very often from the NHTSA.

An affordable vehicle that **runs on electricity.**  This cannot be understated.

To be practical though any data sent back needs to be batched and sent in some interval.  Otherwise all Tesla's would be pounding the 3G network causing issues with their providers or excessive costs to Tesla.  So most likely the cellular link was damaged by the impact with the wall and the pertinent data was never sent.  It should be stored locally on a black-box type recorder but it appears that may have even sustained damage given the extreme nature of this crash.
"At this point it‚Äôs just speculation. It all depends on how you read it, and given the nature of the crash I‚Äôd think that even if autopilot was on the driver initiated a lane change. "

Sounds like Uber and other self driving companies.  We can‚Äôt have 4000lb machines driving around with hacked software because they want to be first to market and beat competitors like tech companies usually work.
"They have working prototypes that have been out on the road for weeks now. If Tesla was still where they were at the Roadster stage, i'd agree with you. But Tesla isn't Faraday Future or those other startups that can't even get to full production anymore. We're long past that with Tesla. Do they have issues ramping up production? Absolutely. Do they have issues simply getting to production? Not in a very long time. Tesla will get to production with the Semi. That's not even an issue. These companies are pre-ordering the product because they went to the unveil event and tried it and made the executive decision. If it was truly vaporware like Faraday Future and the like, it wouldn't have the hype it has.

>Meanwhile people pay extra scrutiny to Tesla accidents because they are the only company irresponsible enough to ship beta versions of safety critical features to their cars while being misleading about how much safer their cars are.

That's completely fair, but ultimately still, paying extra scrutiny does not equate to implication of fault without proof. When they finish the investigations and find autopilot or a person unknowingly or accidentally using autopilot incorrectly to be the reason for the crash, then they can blame Tesla all they want, but until that's proven to be the case. All the implying and singling Tesla out like they already know it's their fault is still somewhat slanderous."
"You can be an industry disrupting product if the industry is disrupted by the product. It has nothing to do with production. 

Tesla is not a vaporware company. The Model S changed the world.

Re: critical safety, you have seen the long list of safety related recalls from every car manufacturer right? You do know that they constantly ship things that aren't fully tested? Plus the Model X safety features are off the charts. And, people don't have to use Autopilot if they don't want to. We have become risk averse, and the long game on self-driving is improved safety."
"Their cars are by far the safest on the road. Even a beta version that isn't as safe as it could be is still far above the best cars on the road, let alone the tests needed to certify them."
"There are a lot of vested interests that are anti-renewables though, and a strong following around those interests. See the Koch brothers. It's not a conspiracy."
"Good question, you'd probably have to ask Daimler/Mercede's press team or social media managers what their cultural/societal reach is for that product. That or conduct a survey."
"If the crash is because of the truck's tech like autopilot or some other Tesla specific feature and not the driver or another driver or some other outside circumstances. Yes, absolutely. That's my point. If the crash is actually the fault of the tech and not the usual things that cause all other crashes, then yes report that Tesla is at fault. If that's **not** the case though, and the crash is because the human driver fucked up or another driver fucked up or there was no guardrail on the section of highway where the crash happened or whatever. Still report on the crash, but the headline shouldn't be ""A Tesla Semi crashed!"" because that very obviously implies the Tesla is at fault when it likely wasn't. The thing I would have issue with is if say another driver crashes into a Tesla Semi and that other driver is at fault. The headlines in the press would still likely all say ""Uh oh! A Tesla Semi crashed!"" As opposed to ""A driver crashed into a Tesla Semi"" or at the very least ""A Tesla Semi was *involved* in a crash, click to find out what happened"". I'm not saying we need to ignore bad Tesla press. I just want it to be accurate."
"By ""under the microscope"" we're referring to sensationalized articles. And of course it should be. Frankly, I'm not so sure the sensationalized articles aren't a bad thing for autonomous driving, it helps keep reckless companies like Uber in check."
Yeah. Glad the top comments are balancing it out. 
i see it. thanks.
"Ah yes, I think you're right... Just noticed his link there.  Guess I expected an /s"
"That doesn't make sense though. Uber is the name of the company operating the car, not the manufacturer, and it was entirely relevant to the story."
I already replied to my own comment saying I saw he was being sarcastic after. 
"My point is I don‚Äôt think the death would‚Äôve been avoided even if it was a human driver that was attentive.

As far as the system controls, Perhaps the large animal detection wasn‚Äôt working?

Here‚Äôs the game.

Watch the [raw video](https://youtu.be/XTXd5bfX_GI)  on your phone and hit the ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù (pause the video) when you see the pedestrian.

Personally, I might have slammed on the brakes, but would have still hit her realistically.
"
"Oh, sorry, I don't do well with sarcasm. :D"
"Well, I‚Äôm an idiot. "
"AP is a component of the car. If it fails, Tesla is at fault. Just as if brakes had failed on an ICE. The problem is AP the component has a lot of operational authority, and a bad ‚Äúdecision‚Äù by AP certainly could make Tesla liable.

You act an awful lot like this is settled law, and I don‚Äôt think it is. At the very least, you open your company up to a large burden of legal costs.

We will see, won‚Äôt we?"
You mean the thing called ‚ÄúAutoPilot‚Äù isn‚Äôt at fault if I engage it and it fails to AUTOMATICALLY PILOT my vehicle?

> To know whether self-driving cars are safer than the traditional kind, you‚Äôd have to know how many miles they traveled before incurring this first fatality. And the answer is ‚Äú fewer than 100 million‚Äù ‚Äî a lot fewer. Waymo, the industry leader, recently reported logging its 4 millionth mile of road travel, with much of that in Western states that offer unusually favorable driving conditions. Uber just reached 2 million miles with its autonomous program. Other companies are working on fully autonomous systems, but adding them all together couldn‚Äôt get us anywhere close to 100 million."
I‚Äôm all for self driving cars but the statistics speak for themselves 
"But their owner used 500,000 of his own money! "
25 million is about as small as it can get and still be called a hedge fund lol
"Yes, obviously.... what are you trying to say?"
"The thing is that while Teslas are already far safer than other vehicles on the road, there is a tendency for vehicle crashes to not make headlines while every accident involving a Tesla does, creating a common misconception that Teslas aren't safe. This is similar to how many mistrust planes and construe them as unsafe, despite there only being a deadly accident once or twice a year. Scrutinizing one brand of vehicle more than another will only lead to false conclusions by the consumer. "

"> Its how I feel from reading & following everything tesla.

Yeah...that's on you, not the media. :)

">  Tesla is leading the way in popularizing desireable electric cars and building hype about them.

Yes, but that doesen't say anything about them leading in the way to fully autonomous driving (https://www.navigantresearch.com/research/navigant-research-leaderboard-automated-driving-vehicles).

Even if you look at the assistance systems currently on the market, I don't see in how far Tesla is leading in that field."

With features that previously were only available in much more expencive models and an infotainment system that's actually better than what is in the s-class.  

All of that at a much lower price point.  

I'm not saying that this is news worthy but so is the model 3. "
There's already plenty of affordable electric cars
"It shows how little the Tesla community knows about the car industry. Saying that there was no innovations in the car industry for the last 20 years is just patently ignorant. It looks like that they think that the only car manufacturer developing new technologies is Tesla.

Especially comparing Tesla with Mercedes. Their new A-Class has a far superior infotainment system and even better assistance system."
"Out of the three you mentioned, only Daimler is innovating. The other two are parallel to Apple.

Not that it arguing about this matters, innovate or die. Good riddance to those self righteous entitled fucks I say, make way for some real competition baby.

This is common on most subs. There is a loud (possibly minority?) group who down votes things critical. But then every so often something critical will get tons of traction. Like a 1:1000 ratio. It's interesting.
"No, there are many of us that are in the middle. Just the most out spoken, or shall I say ""hatred"" just seem to attack or put the other side down. It's like sitting in a bar slamming the beers back, you'll say anything to make your point regardless of right or wrong, or even reason.
 Then there's the trolls, who will type whatever, regardless of whether they believe it or not. 
The problem is you can't fix issues, or see you way to understand a problem if one is closed minded and unable to understand why someone is thinking the way they are. If they are just trolling, or think one can do no wrong, obviously you can't work those people. And that becomes an issue about society in a larger  troubling text. Though for some trolls, that's really what they want. The breakdown of civil society. 

But  guess I'll step down from my soapbox now. LoL


"
"Of course it is. But from their press release it looks like autopilot was on thats all. Again I am not saying its the systems fault or anything,  just that it looks like it was on. Also in autopilot,  the driver has to give turn signal so definitely driver initiated it, but car usually ignores it if it does not have enough space or obstacles are in way. If in fact auto pilot was on, then it most likely did not see the barrier which might be an issue.  But again all this is just speculation at this point. "
"Working prototype aren‚Äôt changing the industry. I never said it‚Äôs vaporware, I‚Äôm simply saying its impact is completely unproven.

To your second point, that‚Äôs just what journalism is these days. Remember when Toyota had the accelerator issue? A ton of accidents involving a Prius were reported by the media with speculation ‚Äúoh the car must be accelerating by itself!‚Äù.
"
"Not to mention most people are not in the know of how production ramps in any other car company. For all we know Toyota always has a similar ramp up only they announce an official release date after they have a reasonable stockpile of built cars.

With Tesla, there is such a push to get pre-orders fulfilled that they are trying to sell them as quickly as they make them. No inventory cars."
"Citation needed.

There is literally nothing in data that can back up your statements there."
"How do you explain the enormous amount of positive (and occasionally undeserved) media attention over the years?  If anything I think there is a pro-Tesla bias, but overall I think its just pro-talking about Tesla.

It's absurd to say everything good that happens Tesla deserves, but everything bad is unfair.  Either both are fair, or both are unfair."
links*  Every word is a different link to hammer in his point.
Not at all. They've turned off Volvo's driver assist systems since this is all about developing their own self-driving tech. So it's all on Uber.
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XOVxSCG8u0

Doubt it, the human in the uber driver wasn't paying attention and the video released was low quality which removes all the light."
LIDAR doesn‚Äôt need ambient light. Even if it had been broad daylight the car would‚Äôve plowed into her. It didn‚Äôt even attempt to brake.
"Well, let's look at trains. Many trains have automatic piloting. Yet you know who is at fault in the case of a train ignoring a signal and causing a crash? The driver.

"
"Yep. It's a level 2. It's your responsibility to yourself to stay alive.

Even when it reaches level 5 and Tesla tells you to stay vigilance, don't go to sleep because we're not ready to 100% hand over the control the car yet, and you get into an accident, you're still responsible for it."
There was just 1 in 2016 (the one that crashed in the truck) and as far as I remember (and can find online) there were none last year.
"1. Nowhere does it say 10x as many fatalities. And you can't calculate that rate from a sample size of 1.
2. They don't count Tesla Autopilot miles. That would add at least [billion of miles](https://electrek.co/2016/11/13/tesla-autopilot-billion-miles-data-self-driving-program/) and put that number well below regular driving. 

Edit:3. Even the article itself says, that you can't look at the data just yet. ""The accident might occur on mile 5 million, or mile 99 million ‚Äî or heck, you might get lucky and not have a fatality until mile 115 million. It‚Äôs not possible to confidently assess the risk of an accident based on a single event like this."""
So what would be the best thing to do in your opinion? Just curious.

Communication is hard.
"That could be down to different policies for test drivers.

Google for example might instruct it's drivers to only intervene when really necessary for safety, whereas uber might instruct it's drivers to intervene whenever the car isn't driving perfectly so it ""learns"".

Eg. if the car is driving slightly to the left of a lane rather than the middle of a lane of traffic, uber might intervene."

"They both have the same roughly the same number of Google hits, as I wrote in another post. I'm not sure what search frequency had to do with anything."

"Those are search statistics, which are not the same thing as Google hits."
I do not mean to rain on your parade here but the Model 3 looks pretty much like any other 4 door sedan. Do not get me wrong I like Teslas and absolutely love the Autopilot.

"Maybe I didn‚Äôt formulate myself properly, what I attempted to emphasize was that I didn‚Äôt read it as if autopilot was on."
Seems you were right in your interpretation and autopilot was engaged without the driver interacting. Seems like a shitty move for the car to drive someone into a barrier just because they‚Äôre not putting their hands  on the steering wheel. 
"It's splitting hairs kind of. I definitely see where you're coming from there. It's absolutely fair to say nothing changes till the product is commercially available, but i also think the industries mentality change, both in companies placing so many pre-orders as well as some competition working on competing electric semis, in the lead up to this product becoming widely available counts for something too. I think the ripple effect happening is part of the proof of impact. Not to imply Tesla was first, because i think some other company had an electric semi prototype first, but Tesla was first to make it appealing enough to the freight industry for them to want to put money down.

Yeah that's a good point about the Toyota accelerator issue. This is all largely just a result of journalism being... the way it is today. It's all about the clickbait (whether it's a good or bad headline)."
They are changing the industry though if the industry changes how it designs products.

"You seem to be drawing some kind of false equivalency where anti-Tesla lobbying and propaganda is okay because the media is sometimes optimistic. Tesla has already changed the world and done what many people thought was impossible. It's ignited an excitement for progress worldwide, and people are coming out in support of that. If anything, we need more focus on innovation, not less, and certainly not less just because some people think there ought to be more bellyaching and FUD to balance it."
Human reaction time is less than .300 of a seconds. Try pausing the video as soon as you see the lady. 
See raw video footage above.
"How many people do you think actually know that there are even levels of automated driving? 

There has to be a significant amount of people that see that Tesla has ‚ÄúAutoPilot‚Äù and just assume it does all it needs to. I mean hell there was that one guy that was laid back taking a nap in his Tesla while it sped down the highway that ran into a white moving van. That guy should have never even considered laying back in his seat for a snooze, but because he has a car with a feature labeled AutoPilot he assumed it could automatically pilot his car."
"> Even when it reaches level 5 and Tesla tells you to stay vigilance, don't go to sleep because we're not ready to 100% hand over the control the car yet, and you get into an accident, you're still responsible for it.

Well if the human is expected to maintain some level alertness and response, then it's not really Level 5.  It's Level 3."

Not to mention it's an opinion piece. 
"Wasn‚Äôt the first accident of an ICE vehicle the day after it started using public roads? 

I am not siding one way or the other on if they are safer or not but agree it is too early to tell. "
So 2 deaths in 5 million miles doesn‚Äôt count because the sample size is too small? Regular cars have less than 1 fatality per 100 million miles 
"Ban all self driving cars and arrest anyone caught inside one, at least until they drive enough miles to prove that they are safe "
"Exactly what I said..... 2 of their bond packages are due in the next 18 months and they will have to raise cash again anyway.

"You were too busy imagining a Metro at 120 mph, weren't you :P"
"The policy is the same for both. The human is only there to prevent the car from hitting something or someone. 

A key difference between Waymo and Uber is where those vehicles operating. Uber has most of their fleet operating in high density areas - basically down town. Areas with high traffic and lots of pedestrians. 

Waymo is investing more time in mapping out larger areas. They‚Äôre evenly distributing their fleet into zones, instead of focusing on specific locations.  

Uber wants to create an autonomous cab service. It makes sense to focus attention on high density areas, that‚Äôs where all the people and money are. 

"
"Reddit loves Tesla. It‚Äôs confirmation bias, anything that doesn‚Äôt support Tesla being #1 will be ignored or downplayed since it doesn‚Äôt support that narrative.  "
Exactly what I expected when posting this. Funny how they just downvote facts that doesn't fit their opinion. 
"You would have to dig into the methodoloy to tease out the particulars but a study that sticks Tesla nearly dead-last after every other auto brand in terms of self-driving tech (not just not first, nearly last) looks very suspect. In other words it looks like bullshit. Tesla is out and about, driving with lots of features. Where are all these other cars with their supposed superior and better known to public tech?"
"Just look at the study I sent, they look at pretty much everything you would define as ""leading"":
> This Navigant Research Leaderboard evaluates 19 companies developing automated driving systems. These players are rated on 10 criteria: vision; go-to market strategy; partners; production strategy; technology; sales, marketing, and distribution; product capability; product quality and reliability; product portfolio; and staying power. "
Are you suggesting they are using ‚Äúleading‚Äù phrasing? 
"They‚Äôre developing the technology. They aren‚Äôt picking up passengers yet, but I used to see a dozen Uber self driving cars a day collecting data before the recent suspension of the program. One of their cars hit and killed a woman crossing the street illegally in the middle of the night. 

Waymo also has hundreds of cars collecting data in the same way. Their fleet is in the hundreds, and they can constantly be found on the streets in my home town. Like Uber, they‚Äôre also developing software designed to more accurately predict and react to unpredictable circumstances. Waymo is the industry leader when it comes to technology behind how these cars drive.

Waymo and Uber plan to begin picking up passengers in a couple years. Obviously, making the cars as safe as possible first is a priority for both companies. "
"Well, the first A-class got a lot of attention, but for all the wrong reasons.  "
Sounds good to me
"now I'm wondering about your definition of a car and why any of the other EVs aren't ""real"" cars"
"Ah, so your actual argument has more to do with looks and status than functionality.

Tesla reminds me a lot of Apple during the Steve Jobs era. Marketing is important, but there is some serious fanboy stuff going on."
"If it costs less it will have less amenities, be less of a status symbol and will probably be uglier. This is how cars work. Have you ever owned a car?"
"Hits are an absolutely meaningless metric. Search traffic is what's actually relevant.

"Your right, it's a much more useful metric than hits. Hits are meaningless"
"It doesn't really matter what it looks like as long as it looks good, what matters are three things: performance, common parlance, sex factor. The Bolt has none of these things, The Bolt is just a weird bubble car with kinda shitty seats. comparing it to a model 5, which is 0-60 in 5 seconds, sexy af, and everyone is talking about, is just stupid.

Edit: the Tesla 3 is Ford Focus RS speeds, the Chevy is Ford Focus ST speeds. That should tell you everything you need to know on why people like the Tesla 3"
I'm saying using a tool like Google trends is a good way to dispel our own biases.

"Tesla is actually the one who fucked off there, and chose to use a non-standard charger plug."
Yeah they really need to sort this out. They cant have it both ways. Either its just adaptive cruise control or its a semi automated driving.  By staying in this Gray area they were trying to be clever but now it is hurting them. They really need to hammer the point that its not automated driving and driver needs to pay attention at all times.
Any citation on how the semi industry is now changing their product designs?

"I am pretty sure I'm a lot more educated than you are on this topic.

NHTSA does not have test scores against all the major competitors of the Model S, scoring well against one particular test does not support your argument of ""by far the safest on the road"".

In more stringent tests where Tesla competitors *are scored*, such as IIHS and EuroCap, the Model S scores well below competitors. The Model S isn't even a Top Safety Pick+ on the IIHS list, where as both the E class and 5 series are.

TL;DR Tesla engineered their vehicle to get the highest score possible on NHTSA test, which has a relatively small test result set and does not have comparable results for modern competitors of Model S."
"That's the point of contention, our eyes work better than the potato quality video that has been shown. If the operator was actually looking down the street, maybe she would of spotted the dark figure sooner than the video shows. Also we haven't seen any videos of the lidar, which would work in low light conditions to see how much reaction time a car should have to avoid her."
"I'd like to say that isn't ""raw"" footage. It's not what the average human sees in terms of resolution and quality so it's not really representative of what an actual driver would see. Even in 720p60fps the trees are blurry to the point of being unable to discern detail, one cannot see the highly lighted building in the foreground which would be seen with the human eye due to all the lights on the building. If this is what the human eye sees, the streetlight in the right side of the picture would only be lighting up an area equal to one square meter, which isn't at all what ambient light covers.
 
You can actually see the same thing happening with the interior. I doubt an actual human would be grayscale and so why would you think the outside would be different? That video desaturates the actual outcome making it seem darker than usual. "
Why are the uneducated dumb masses the fault of any company?
"You might reach level 5 for 99.99% of the cases but for that 0.01%, you still want the users to be alert.

I think it would take a couple of years, probably 5 years, after the company declaring it has reached level 5 for the government to offically recognize it and let you go to sleep at the wheel."
It makes as much difference as the color of the car. If the autopilot was not engaged then it‚Äôs just a regular car.
"You count the death that was caused by Tesla Autopilot, but refuse to count miles that was logged with Tesla Autopilot? Do you think that's fair?"
Banning cars and arresting users is probably the worst thing you can do if you ever want that technology developed. 
"You are not serious, right?"
How can they drive them if you Arrest them?
"Not sure if trolling, but if you dont place anyone in it and let them drive on their own don't you think the death toll would be way higher than with human supervision on every single mile?"

Almost. I was imagining one going 193.221km/h ('cause I'm in a metric bit of the world)
"You know those wobbly metal carts that are held together with friction and well-wishes? I just imagine a Geo Metro at 120 would be something like that. Just wobbiling about, seconds from either losing a wheel and cartwheeling over itself, or shedding body panels until there's nothing more than a shell with a driver and that sad, pathetic, anemic little drivetrain left, wheezing into its final moments."
">The policy is the same for both. The human is only there to prevent the car from hitting something or someone.

That isn't the case.  Test drivers are frequently given instructions about test methodologies, specific things to lookout for, specific things to report, situations to get the car into they want more data on, etc."
So you are just ignoring a scientific study because it does not fit your opinion. Do you have another scientific source that says otherwise? 
"Tesla vehicles are not fully autonomous. The driver is expected to still be in control of the car. In order to test fully autonomous vehicles on public roads, the state and local government need to approve the use of them first. Currently, only a handful of states and cities have approved fully autonomous vehicle testing. Unless you live in an approved city, you aren‚Äôt going to see any using the advanced technology. It‚Äôs also important to note that Tesla has not pursued any of those permits. 

Companies like Waymo and Uber are currently testing fully autonomous vehicles on public roads. I‚Äôm from Phoenix, Arizona. Testing is legal here, and I see them all the time. Although, Uber currently suspended the program and has a temporary cease and desist since one of their cars hit and killed someone. 

It gets more complicated, for example Waymo has a relationship with Jaguar and Toyota. Currently, their fleet is almost all Toyota cars (Lexus mostly). Uber has a relationship with Volvo, their entire fleet is Volvo. 

Meanwhile, Tesla is keeping to themselves, doing their own thing. "
"Funny I see Teslas all over the country, in every state I've been to.  Never seen an Uber or Waymo.  As the leader in the tech, I would expect them to be ubiquitous given the breadth of Tesla's reach.

"Uh.... the car is significantly more ""functional.""  It's also safer, faster, and an all around better performing car.

The bolt is more expensive than the SR 3. Chevy's market is people who want an EV without the Tesla wait.  
"The OP asked about Tesla news, not Tesla search traffic. Google hits may not be interesting to an SEO, but it is a better indicator of actual news stories than search traffic."
"Not necessarily. High search frequency could also mean a lack of publicity, hence why people take to Google to search for information. Hits, on the other hand, represents media coverage more directly."
You sound like you came from Audi to Tesla...
"I agree with you. I don't expect reading something about mercedes or any other OEM in this subreddit either.  
But the point that the OP made was that even outside of this subreddit its always ""tesla crashes"" and not ""car crashes"". And my point is that publicity goes both ways. Outside of car related forums there were barely any news about the new mercedes, which is fair, but when the Model 3 launched every news outlet wrote about it. "

You said they weren't. You don't know that. Every auto company is now influenced by Tesla and investing billions to catch up. Do you think semis wouldn't be the same?

Doesn‚Äôt change the fact
I said temporarily 
Am I? Lol it should obvious 
They are self driving aren‚Äôt they? 
Not according to Musk 
I don't think youunderstand how bonds work..
Most of us are
"To clarify, test drivers are instructed not to intervene with the autonomous functions unless it‚Äôs absolutely necessary. I didn‚Äôt mean to imply that they are sitting there doing nothing until something bad happens. 

"
"You seem to be intentionally misreading what I posted. I am not ignoring it, I said it looked suspect. There are lots of funny ways to manipulate statistics and misrepresent data. "
"I was under impression we are talking about cars that are being sold to consumers, not experimental mules or service cars for fleets?"
"Uber and Waymo are testing fully-autonomous technology on public roads. Testing these vehicles require state and city government approval. There are only handful of cities in the US that allow this technology on public streets. I happen to live in one of them. 

Tesla vehicles are semi-autonomous. Completely legal. Tesla has yet to apply for a permit that allows public testing for autonomous cars.

"> When the A-Class was first made available to the media, the Swedish motor magazine Teknikens V√§rld lined the model up for its so-called moose test, in which the car is made to swerve radically out of its lane and back at a constant 62km/h.

>Strangely, no braking was allowed, even though that would be the smart initial move with a few hundred kilos of prime moose ahead.

>In October 1997 the magazine's head road tester Robert Collin loaded in five people and 75kg of luggage and punted the A-Class down the course.

>It leaned, then leaned some more, then threw its wheels at the sky.(...)

If you don‚Äôt read the whole article this bit is also interesting to note:


> The media and competitors had a field day, while the car and its arrogant maker were the stuff of endless jokes on the new-fangled Internet.

>Benz spent the first week or two in denial, calling the moose test unrealistic, telling the press ""You can tip any car if you really want to"" and restating that there was no problem. When that didn't quash the discontent, Benz blamed tyre supplier Goodyear.

TLDR: The original A-class could easily roll over resulting in a production halt, recall, and the introduction of ESP in a car that wasn‚Äôt the S-class, but at first Mercedes spent a few weeks in total denial. "
"Renault Zoe or Chevy Bolt both offer 200 Miles, cost under 40k while offering fast charging capabilities.  
In most parts of the world 200 miles is usually more than needed. 150 miles real world are usually enought which would include the Leaf, the e-Golf and the Ioniq. The Ioniq is able to use 70KW DC charging, is crazy efficent and costs less than 35k.  
These cars are only a functional compromise if you live in the US.  

The Model 3 is obviously much better but it's also much more expensive and out of reach for many people."
"The bolt has a higher safety rating than a model S (and likely model 3 as well, especially hearing about such blatant manufacturing issues), longer range than a model 3, is faster than a VW gti, and actually delivers the car once it has been purchased.

I agree, sex sells and Tesla has that covered. But to say that there are no alternatives on the market that come close to comparing is a straight up lie. Again, fanboyism."
"The mass market is currently buying Mazda CX-5s and Honda Civics. Not $60,000 cars from a brand they only heard of a few years ago."
"Search raffic varies directly with news articles and public interest. Hits don't

It sounds counterintuitive, buts it's true. Hits are an awful metric of interest or coverage"
"You're assuming I like Tesla? I hate Tesla, as does at least half this subreddit. I'm just trying to explain why the Bolt will never compete in the same market place as a Tesla. 

Get Tesla competitor out of your head, think hot hatch market."
"The true reason for the change is only really known to Tesla execs/engineers, but my understanding is that all chargers in the EU use the same standards, and I seem to recall reading something that Tesla may be required to switch to that standard, which would imply that yes, it can handle the current.

However I don't have a concrete answer and unfortunately don't have the time to really dig into it at the moment. Maybe later tonight I will."
"I can google pretty well, what I can‚Äôt do is teaching reading comprehension and critical thinking to people like you.

Seriously, the burden of proof always lies with people who makes the claim. You don‚Äôt just get to make up an empty claim and then tell people ‚Äúgo google it‚Äù, that‚Äôs not how the world works my friend."
"I don't care about that raw video, because that isn't what the car is using to drive at night (at least I would hope not...)"
"Sorry, english is not my first language, Im having hard time understanding your point. 
You wanted to know how may deaths was with cars with self driving tech in them because you believe that in some of those instances Tesla might be lying about autopilot being on or off? 

EDIT: Of course I understand why they want to make sure if the autopilot was enabled, but I still don't understand how important is knowing how many deaths had with cars that has autopilot. It is as relevant as knowing how many cars had electric windows. "
"Come one man, how does it not change the fact? it literally changed the fact. Its 1 death on 6 million miles or 2 deaths on billion miles. How does that not change the fact? Are you just trolling at this point? Even the article that you cited said that you cant look at the statistics just yet. "
Not really. You said until they can prove that they are safe. Which translates into government terms as impossible standards to never.
Well you said arrest anyone inside them. I'm assuming someone needs to be inside them for them to drive? Maybe I'm wrong on that. 
"Yes, but you cannot provide evidence that the study is manipulated, or can you?
This study is often referenced by experts in the area and I can't think of any reason to distrust it and I also can't see, where it looks suspect to you.

I know that it is pretty common these days to patently distrust studies that doesen't fit ones opinion and immediately think that these facts are manipulated. Without providing solid evidence to the contrary everyone can doubt facts, but it doesen't get you anywhere."
"Op posted that Tesla is setting the bar for autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles aren‚Äôt even legal yet, and Tesla certainly isn‚Äôt leading the way toward them. 

For semi-autonomous cars, I would agree that Tesla would be close to #1, if not #1. "
"I would think they are gathering local data on navigating specific intersection types in local areas that need special attention that companies not operating in those locals would lack in their dataset; they‚Äôll need to localize as they expand.  Tesla already has this information and will have a leg up.  

They are likely waiting to see how the other companies do and let them navigate the costly regulatory process.  

They obviously can‚Äôt afford any more negative press at this point and putting fully autonomous cars on the road seems to only generate negative press despite their great safety ratings. "
Danke!
The markets disagree with your comparison of the 3 and Bolt.
"There are no alternatives on the market that come close to comparing to the model 3 in it's segment if you want an electric car. The only comparable vehicles are not electric. I can't comprehend why people put all electric cars on the same playing field. Sure, people may comparison shop between the two, but the only reason for that is because more and more people will only buy an electric car, and there are not many options that are viable ICE replacements.

So if your criteria for your new car is: replace my ICE, then sure, they're comparable, but really you'd be a dummy for buying into the luxury segment when you were just looking for a people mover that doesn't use gas. There are a few people that shop like this. But the vast majority of the car market is sold on emotion. People either buy a car because it moves them from A to B and it's cheap, or because there is something about it they actually want.

And before you cry ""fanboyism"", I drive a Chevy Volt. I freaking love my car. It moves me from point A to point B. It does so mostly with electricity. It falls back to gas when needed so I never have to plan or alter a trip because of my car. It was dirt cheap by comparison(used. MSRP is in line with a base Model 3), and it's decently fun to drive. But do I think it's a competitor to the Model 3? Not in the slightest... even if it was all electric and had an identical range."
"Yes, exactly. Search traffic varies with public interest. But the OP complained about coverage. 

So if more people search for the T3 than the Bolt, you can't necessarily blame a difference in coverage. It might simply be a difference in public interest."
"Naw, you can't do any of those things, that's pretty clear. You're the one making the claim to be some sort of expert lol and you aren't even aware of some very basic stuff. Talk about being a hypocrite. 

Go google it, is pretty common actually. It's what people tell others who don't have the most basic of clues what is going on, and don't want to spend a goddamn year teaching.

You've got some learning and growing up to do before you're ready to engage in convos here."
Yes you‚Äôre wrong 
"If you read the rest of my replies, I misinterpreted your initial post as claiming that Teslas are behind in terms of being semi-autonomous, which is the reason I voiced my doubts."
"Ah, that's a fair distinction. I have to concur."
[deleted]
"No. Tesla sells cars because of the marketing of Elon. He has sold consumers on a green, solar, driverless future. And people are willing to contribute to that cause.

That doesn't mean that the model 3 destroys everything else in the marketplace. Or is the first affordable EV to the general consumer."
"Nah.. I‚Äôm pretty good where I am, thanks.

Keep believing in whatever you want to, since instead of refuting specific points I made, the only argument you have is ‚Äújust google it‚Äù.

You may be grown up, but you sure have not grown wise."
So it's safe to just let an automated car drive around in real world tests without anyone inside it?
"Ok, then I am sorry that we misunderstood. As always it is important to distinguish between semi-autonomous cars or assistance systems and an fully autonomous car. 

In regards to semi-autonomous cars it is definitively arguable who is leading in that field."
"His statement was ambiguous. 

Tesla is leading the market with semi-autonomous cars. 

Tesla‚Äôs technology is behind fully autonomous cars. 

Both are facts.

Take whatever stance you want, but the ambiguity of OPs post lead to a constructive discussion. Nobody acted out, nobody was name calling. It didn‚Äôt devolve at all. "
nah... you're really not.
Didn't expect them to be in operation so soon! That's awesome.

"Are these the same two trucks from the reveal event?
"
"Some fun recaps about this route:

**Distance**  
Depending on exact route - 260-270 miles. Within the range of even the shorter range semi in a single trip.

**Elevation Change**  
Sparks, Nevada (where the Gigafactory is located) is 4,400 feet above sea level, whereas Fremont is only 56. So making the descent under regen braking with the added weight generating more energy and then turning around and making the climb while unloaded is very efficient and will reduce the actual amount of charging the trucks have to do."
Looks like they put on the side mirrors for the trip 
"Pretty sure these are prototype trucks moving *production loads*.  Not production trucks, right? Why would they divert any assembly line energy away from the 3??"
"Amazing.

How to frighten Mercedes and Scania in one tweet !

Of course, I jest, but this is awesome!"

"If all the batteries they were hauling were connected to the truck, how far could it go?"
"Dang, next we gotta see them moving a Falcon 9 down the road!"
I'm really curious to hear how things like the aerodynamic top affects mileage.  If they're doing runs between the factories with similar loads it's provide some great comparisons.

Nice!  I wonder how many Model 3 battery packs can fit in each trailer.
That's cool.  One of my guys in the field sent me a pic of the black one.  I'm heading out there tomorrow hopefully it's still there so I can get up close.

I look forward to Tesla Tractors for agriculture. I feel like their missing the boat not getting into that field if they can do a Tesla Semi. 
Why do I get the feeling the Musk economy is like an RTS game? Once you‚Äôve build a gigafactory it opens up a whole branch of the tech tree

omg skip photo shooting. get those battery down the factory and make my car
"The license in the silver truck is different than the license of the prototype that was spotted driving up to Nevada from Fremont.

The license of the black truck is also different than the black truck that was spotted in Fremont.

Maybe they just changed the plates in the Gigafactory but it's a bit weird right? Do you still think these are the same vehicles?

There seems to be an identificacion number on the side but I could not read it.

EDIT

Serial number on the black truck that was spotted by Brandon Camargo in Fremont was USDOT 2298288
License plate was something like 63277
On the Gigafactory, the license plate of the black truck is XP24262, I could not read the USDOT number

EDIT2

Serial number on the silver truck that spotted in another youtube video was also USDOT 2298288 :( maybe that only identifies the manufacturer?"
"Does anyone know why they chose to build the batteries in the mountains of Nevada?  Does the cool air have any effect, or is it taxes?"

"I like how the cab/tractor portion is insanely futuristic in its styling, while the trailer is just a plain ol' regular trailer."
The entire container is filled with batteries that the truck itself runs on so they can make it that distance! /s
It would be cool if the battery pack cargo actually powered the semi as part of testing the packs. Then they could turn around the trucks at each end without charging.
Has the trip actually happened or both trucks are still at the factory?
They need to build MOAR Trucks so they can make MOAR Precious Model 3.  NOW!!!
So.... How long until someone finds it on the highway and snaps pics and videos of it in action?
Wouldn‚Äôt there be a lot of regulatory hurdles to clear before these are street legal?
Did it drive itself?
Are there temp mirrors attached?  Imgur and Instagram blocked at work.

Wait so they built trucks that are now helping to build more trucks? That's some next level automation
"I have ELI5s.

- how can you use prototype semi trucks on public roads ?  What are the regulations ?  I can see next to final models being tested on roads, but the semi seems more alpha than anything, no ? Am I wrong in their completeness ?

- power where do these get their charge back while on the road ? SC ?  Someone would see them charging. Or perhaps no top off needed between gigafactory and Fremont ?"
It's a day later - did these things arrive or not? It is only a 5 hour drive. There is not one picture of these arriving. Did they break down? 
"There's a 14,600 foot descent during the journey.  It would be most efficient if they were not fully charged when they departed the gigafactory so that they could absorb some of the energy from that descent.  They'd still arrive at Fremont somewhat depleted. I wonder how long they'd have to charge at Fremont to make the return journey. "
"""First production"" is a really interesting term for him to use. That implies that this is more than just a prototype based on its usage with the Model 3.  

Of course, maybe he didn't really think about the words before he typed them."
Where‚Äôs my gad damn Model 3?!   Who gives a shit about a semi right now? Are there like 300k model 3s that need to be delivered??!

"soon Tesla Semi's on autopilot delivering batteries to car factory.   in a bit further, it'll be Tesla Semi's on autopilot delivering battery packs to semi factory.   and Tesla Semi's picking up materials and delivering them to GF1.   then full factory automation kicks in.    

this is how we get skynet....so if Elon's smug mug shows up on a T-9000X, you'll know why.   "
[deleted]
Awesome. Looks like Tesla hasn‚Äôt even bothered to make proper trailers for these. That‚Äôs some generic shit right there. They‚Äôll probably whip up some really cool aerodynamic trailers for these at some point. I guess the ones from the reveal event were ‚Äòfake‚Äô?
"Not viable in the slighest but cool enough, prehaps when batteries get better we might be able to do this."
So nobody at Tesla actually drives a Tesla I guess
"Cool batteries to pollute more landfills with, still require electric, which in the U.S is mostly coal.

"I *highly* doubt these are anywhere close to being in operation.  In typical Elon fashion, this is likely Tesla hitting 2x birds with 1x stone.

Birds being: initial testing of the semi under moderate load and also being able to say they use the semi's to ship batteries to Fremont."
"If you're going to warrant something for a million miles, you really need to drive at least one for a million miles to see what will go wrong...

That takes a while, so it's best to get started soon."
"This has been discussed many times on /r/SpaceX, and the general consensus is that SpaceX doesn't want to draw attention to the rocket as it travels. A Tesla Semi would have very predictable stops (megachargers) to worry about."
"Entirely possible to move one, just probably won‚Äôt happen until they an establish a good charging network as the trip most falcon 9‚Äôs take is fairly long so it might need charging, it could work if they swap out trucks though"
"I think you'd need something a bit bigger than a semi lol

Edit : lol why do people reply saying the exact same thing that many other people have already said? Its like they want to prove they knew too or something.

Anyway I know a semi can pull/haul a falcon 9 first stage, but carrying is normally used to describe a load onnn the semi trailer right? That's what I meant "
Yes
Do they have any other street ready prototypes?
I'm sure.
"There are mining operations that use EV trucks that don't have to charge the batteries at all.  The trucks start at the top of a mountain with full loads, regen on the way down, and then drive back up empty on the stored energy.

"Don't forget Donner Summit is between the two locations at 7,056 ft

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donner_Pass"
Makes sense now why someone saw the truck without a load heading east and posted the video a few days ago.
"Well, they have to go through Truckee and over Donner pass which is more like 7200'."
I think US safety standards require mirrors (ie: don't allow camera-only) for the moment.
"The prototypes have had mirrors on for a while now, since they‚Äôve been testing on public roads after the reveal event. "
"A lot of units in testing that have been photographed and video'd with the mirrors lately.  US Law still requires them, Tesla just has a habit of leaving them off their promo cars until forced to put them back, they've been fighting that dumb law since the beginning."
Good publicity stunt would be to get pulled over and impounded for driving it
[deleted]
Most likely correct.
"Are there any DOT restrictions on prototypes used in this fashion?  Clearly other engineering prototypes have been used by manufacturers on public highways before, and in this case it is an internal load (aka the load being carried is for internal consumption only by Tesla Motors).

My question is if a prototype could be put into revenue service in this fashion or if there are other restrictions before the vehicle can be put into general use when it is going through the final rounds of qualification for DOT certification?"
"They appear to be the same models shown in the unveil event. Could be that Tesla put a lot of resources into it so decided to just go all in & use them for something productive instead, such as great PR as seen here.

Musk did say these are 'first production' trucks, meaning unlike the Model 3, the design that was shown to us at the event was pretty much penultimate pending several software/UI additions [given their focus is on Model 3 bringup](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/970096186806878208) & Autopilot in that dept.

First Production in the conventional sense would indicate these to be the finished versions of the product & the result of an initial test run or 'pre-production' calibration phase of the assembly equipment. Which certainly doesn't make it any easier to figure out what Musk was referring to.

Also most internal information on the Fremont factory is now outdated but if I seem to recall correctly, Tesla did salvage a secondary production line from when they acquired the factory which initially had dual lines to when they decided to give one of 'em a major technological upgrade back during the Model X ramp.

That line was then considered to be used for experimental purposes - could be the Semi & 2020 Roadster were manufactured there. However, this is mostly conjecture based on several legacy TMC threads floating out there."
Sounds like these are production spec ready trucks.  They've been moving loads for Tesla with the disguised prototype trucks since 2016.
"Bold move... They trust the trucks then.  But these are not autonomous yet, right?"
Yes. These are highly prototype. More duct tape than truck from what I‚Äôve heard. 
Elon broke physics and time.

I love those decapitation wings :)

One is more towards the left of the photo
Pretty far
I can imagine a trailer built specifically for Tesla trucks with batteries under the floor and an extra cable to transfer the power to the tractor. That would be amazing.
Someone above calculated around 2000 miles fully loaded.
Did anyone say mobile supercharger? Or maybe in transit AP asisted supercharging?
At least 10 miles. Could be more. 
"Yeah easily, an F9 is only about 60,000 lbs"
I think that's why they did it like that. Interestingly no cover over the wheels
Bet there are lots of less visible little differences they can compare under real world conditions with these prototypes. Would love to know what their engineering teams are working on behind the scenes!
You really think after announcing trucks making promises they just now started to do runs for comparison? They had the whole system setup years before inside regular trucks that were used as frames to test the battery range and load etc this is just them doing a run for media. All those comparison studies have already been completed and done or else they wouldn't be taking reservations. Now it will be fine tuning and getting them produced

Thank you!
"I bet the Model 3 pack is 1,000-1,100 lbs plus dunnage. I bet they're hitting the ~40k max payload for the semi (actual weight depends on state laws) before they max out the volume of the trailer.

My guess is 36 packs per semi load"

"OTR trucking is the easiest area to jump into. It's one base design that fits everything from local delivery to long haul with only aero mods.

Tractors are specifically suited to the task at hand.
"
I think they need to offer a yard tractor type configuration. An electric yard tractor makes 100% sense. 
"Dirt farmers that I know need the ability to work their machines 24 hours a day for several days during planting and harvest, and the requirement of hydraulics and PTO on a mobile platform would be much more of a challenge than propulsion."
"I'm a firefighter and am mildly interested in the concept of an electric fire truck, but the reality is probably that that particular application is a *long* way off. Reasons:

 - Pumper trucks (fire engines) sit and operate on a fire scene for hours (and, in extremes, days) at a time. In an ICE world, a pumper is essentially running in 4th gear at 1500-2000 RPM (diesel) all that time (the driveshaft is simply diverted from going to the rear wheels, to going to a pump shaft, so it accumulates ""mileage"" all that time). It's nowhere near the kind of mileage that a highway tractor gets - my department sold a pumper that was 22 years old and it had less than 50,000 km on it. Unless someone can come up with a ""mobile megacharger"" that can come to a fire scene and provide extra juice, or a way to hot-swap batteries, fire pumpers are not going to be fully electric any time soon. [Edit: I appreciate that electric motors could be far more efficient than a diesel power plant, but even if you could develop an electric pumper, you can't just leave the scene when you have to go to a megacharger to top up - we even have an industry now involved with delivering diesel fuel to places where trucks are working, so they don't have to leave the site.]

 - I might see a rescue truck or something else that doesn't have a pump or need a substantial hydraulic system (like a ladder truck) be electric first. Our rescue truck is essentially a very customized walk-in cargo van - it's got a PTO-powered electric generator for AC power at scenes and a 6000W light tower. Other rescues will also have things like air compressors and maybe a hydraulic pump for rescue tools (the ""jaws of life""). While at a scene, technically the rescue could sit without the engine running, if it didn't need to keep the batteries charged from running the emergency lights etc all the time.

If Tesla wants to throw a 30' rescue box on the back of one of those prototypes and paint the whole thing red, I can give them an address to bring it to... :D"
"I could see that one being tough. Lots of agriculture equipment basically has to run 24/7 for a couple weeks and is parked the rest of the year. I may get crucified for saying this on a Tesla thread, but in that situation I think hydrogen may not be the worst solution. "
Boats don‚Äôt belong in fields üòù 
Tesla tractors would be out standing in their field.
"I need them to do a Tesla pedal bike. Would be the only one I could afford (well, maybe...)."

"It‚Äôs not like they looked at it and said no. They are still a young company and are still rolling out new products. Makes sense to stay with on road vehicles first, a lot more in common with sedans, SUVs, and trucks than a tractor. "
Little hard to deliver the required power to the middle of nowhere I suppose. 
"Doubtful. You can operate right hand drive cars in the US without any special license so I wouldn't think being in the center would be any worse than being on the ""wrong"" side altogether."
Elon should know about this since he used to have a McLaren F1!
"Here in Australia you need to display a notice that the vehicle is left-hand drive, but apart from that I don't think there's any special licensing requirements."
That's a great idea. No actual battery needed going one way. 
But then the capacity is limited to two washing machines squeezed behind the batteries.
"You just jinxed it, Semi now starts production in 2025"
"I would bet you that the process of manufacturing a semi truck is easier than a luxury car. Less expectation of perfect fit and finish, larger/ easier to build parts, etc."
Why do you think that? These prototypes are the same ones from the reveal. 
"It helps that they announced it really late, the first publicly seen tesla semis were spotted towing loads for tesla in 2016."
every cent counts!
So what discount does that mean for the Model 3 price?
These were built before taking deposits for the Semi. They‚Äôre the same prototypes from the reveal event. 
What better way to get test data on the performance of the actual production vehicles than to use the prototypes in real-world conditions/situations?
Taxes yes and availability of affordable real-estate.  You can't exactly find that many open square feet in the bay area for a reasonable price.

"The land in the business park was available and the permitting process was quicker in Nevada. They were able to break ground faster if they chose that site than the sites in the other 3 states they considered.

It also has good placement for Solar PV and Wind power for the plant.

Temperature of the air wasn't a factor."
"Iirc solar availability, large amount of already flattened land , and huge tax breaks to incentivize Tesla moving in "
"It was supposed to be closer to minerals needed for battery production, but I don't think that has worked out.  The goal is supposed to get minerals locally and turn them into batteries.

That said, there are clearly other perks such as taxes, space, proximity to freemont, rail lines, solar, low cost of living, etc."
Dry air is better for battery cell manufacturing.

"Given that the Liberal/National COALition runs on crumbly black rocks, that seems unlikely to happen."
"Well, shipping containers are shipping containers. They all have to be able to be stacked on top of each other."
"maybe not needed for battery / drive unit loads from Sparks to Fremont, but this would be very useful for actually delivering the cars.  

they use rail for longer cross country trips, and If they typically have 7 cars on a delivery truck, charging them up and plugging them into the truck could add 50% range.  cheaper than adding more batteries and reducing the truck's carrying capacity.  
"
I saw one parked off the 395 in December but I was driving so I didn't get a chance to take a picture.

"No, why?"
"Not really. Just need safety and emissions certifications. The safety inspection is where they would identify anything that makes it not street legal.  

Per this, there's a few other documents needed regarding construction and part sourcing:  
https://www.dmv.org/articles/register-your-ride-how-to-register-a-custom-built-car/"
Side mirrors? Yes
No
"They will be, as all Tesla cars. "
"It's dumb. It offers no advantages over traditional seating and several disadvantages.  It's just a ""ooh wow innovation!"" Feature.  It's different so it must be better. "
"Using your own product is not automation, it's at most a feedback loop for testing and development purposes, and good for prestige.  

These are the prototype trucks from last year being tested carrying Model 3 battery packs."
"This is a 260 mile trip, truck range is 300 miles, optional upgrade will give it 500 mile range. No charging needed for this trip."
[deleted]
"‚ÄúProduction cargo‚Äù, not production trucks. It‚Äôs hauling the Model 3 batteries over to Fremont. "
The whole markets down. You‚Äôre just hating 
"Oh yeah. Your right. /S

Oh, that's right it was spotted heading out to the factory on an upswing. Hmm."
"Aim is to be able to transport regular-looking hauls, so it's doubtful they'll customize that for anything else than press events."
"Thoughts: 

 - Possibly want to do a couple of runs with trailers that meet the configuration of 99% of the vans on the road, so they can give accurate numbers to customers.

 - The silver truck with its tall fairing is about as aerodynamically optimal as it can get, minus the [trailer side skirts](https://i.imgur.com/kT9zZqi.jpg) and potentially the [rear cone](https://i.imgur.com/uhxvsJ1.jpg). "
What are you talking about might be able to they are doing it right the second
Dont think they make enough money 
"Why do you think the US mostly uses coal? It's not true at all.  

Anyway, coal is declining and renewables are rising."
"A very ill informed comment. Gigafactory will be able to refine lithium out of dead batteries on an unprecedented industrial scale thus saving batteries from going to landfill. 

As for coal.. Americas current politically blinkered Victorian era stance on utility scale energy production shouldn't be an argument against electrified transportation. Look at the UK's recent success on the divestment of coal. America can do better but seems to be stuck 100yrs in the past. "
Most batteries are recycled.
"I want to see the whole drive from Gigafactory 1 to Fremont. Can someone put a GoPro on the forehead of the truck driver?

Edit: Yeah, true, someone can follow the truck but they won't see the nice HUD from the driver POV ;-) and all the data we could get"
"It won't be anything spectacular & neither be quite aesthetically pleasing to the eyes unlike the current SC network. At least I won't be surprised if it is, since the favourable market segment is corporations, cost is the primary influencing factor. Expect huge typical industrial equipment boxes shape like shipping containers or large diesel generators with multiple Powerpacks running the show."
"Maybe it‚Äôs just a giant lighting rod? :D  I can imagine the slogan now: ‚ÄúTesla, powered by the gods‚Äù"
"They got a little bit of climbing to do as well after Reno and up that canyon to the Donner summit... from there, its almost all regen braking, I assume, until Roseville"
"Looks like those Semis are towing single 53-ft trailers. The Semi is rated Class 8 which means that the weight of the Semi plus the trailer(s) plus cargo is limited to 80,000 lb without special permitting to exceed that limit. Max cargo weight should be between 45-50 Klb."
"Or, technically, they could be hooked up to all the battery packs they are carrying in the trailer."
"Making it isn't the challenge, successfully delivering these to perform under the rigorous industry specifications that the conventions demand while maintaining superfluous reliability barriers would be the real issue.

Not to mention certification/regulation for the atypical omission of side mirrors et al., & of course Autopilot features. Safe to say apart from the battery supply constraints, Tesla should be able to deliver the Semi on time, if not earlier."
"I'm just an armchair person, but I don't think there is a huge difference between what they put in the semi vs the cars except more of it whereas ICE requires all new setups.  

It's also very likely they had it being developed for far longer."
Takes people's minds off the model not being made basically 
"I fail to see how your first sentence reconciles with your next paragraph. If the trucks are moving moderate loads of batteries between Sparks and Fremont, they are more than close to being in operation..."
Can you tell me more about what they think the risks are in drawing attention to the rocket?
"Someone above pointed out that they could always just swap out the truck, doesn't take long to unhitch and hitch."
"SpaceX /Tesla could always add more batteries to either the truck or trailer, as well as a genset to power while underway (they'd need a hefty one?), and swap out trucks when a driver needs a rest stop anyway.  As it is I think they usually unhitch to go and refuel anyway."
[deleted]
Seems like they‚Äôd add batteries to the trailer for something like this
The PR would make it worth I guess.
"If only they could have something onboard, like a rocket or something..."
"Falcon 9 dry mass is only ~23,000kg. Hauling mass will be even less than that because the stages are shipped separately. Quite doable with the current Tesla semi (and any semi for that matter)"
"You realize they:

A: Don't ship it full of fuel

B: Ship it in stages"
[https://twitter.com/parkerhagan/status/881206323278491652](https://twitter.com/parkerhagan/status/881206323278491652)
"I think what we really need is something bigger than a Falcon 9. Falcon 9s are regularly hauled by semis.

BFR here we come."
[removed]
"So far it looks like just the 2 you see here.  There's a few original [super alpha prototypes floating around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHNgSMhkoBk) but I doubt those are really being used anymore now that they have actual prototypes.

There might be a few more being built for testing, but the public has only seen the original 2 so far."
"The prototypes are much more expensive to make than the production versions will be, so they probably won't be making more without a good reason."
"Even better, it has excess energy, 200kWh per day needs to be dumped in the grid."
That's really cool - got a link?
"this is awesome, would love to know of where i can read more about this"
"Ok if they can make those big old earth movers electric, then I've got high hopes "
Do they really? I was under the impression that most giant diesel electric trucks mostly use motor-braking and dump the energy into radiators just so they can avoid brake pads. 
"How exactly are they dumping excess to the grid? That would require some kind of charging station that can accept current in the discharge direction. Also adds lots of unnecessary down time. If you can avoid charging, why add in discharging stops, as opposed to dumping the energy to a radiator? I would be very skeptical that the electricity is more valuable than the stuff they could haul in an equivalent time as the discharge stop(s).

Also, this is a rather unique setup. The vast majority of mines are setup to load trucks in a pit and send them up loaded. That tends to be the nature of mineral extraction."
"Wow, that is hella cool"
There is a quarry with one truck.
There is a quarry with one truck.
perpetual motion machine?
"That's impossible

Oh sorry i missed the part that it was loaded going down and empty going up."
Stop you're making me hungry!
"I drive between Reno and the East Bay regularly. The westbound trip is more efficient than the eastbound trip. I think it‚Äôs because heading west, you climb very quickly and gradually descend over many miles. Heading east, you‚Äôre uphill for a long distance and only descend briefly."
"Yeah, but your also generating electricity from The summit to the factory"
[deleted]
"The Semis use Model 3 motors. But I agree, I believe he meant the cargo is production, not the Semis."
"No way it‚Äôs getting used to haul other people‚Äôs freight, it will be Tesla exclusive until it starts shipping to customers, all sorts of insurance and legal issues.

100% they are doing this to demo to everyone that made pre orders. 

Lastly that‚Äôs a lucky sob that gets to drive that route 24/7!"
"Last I heard both lines are operating.   Originally it was just an S line.  Then they (re)built that second line to handle both S & X, learning from the first line.  At some point (unsure when), after the second line was operating fine, they went back and rebuilt the original line to also handle both S & X.  That was a few years back now. 

The model 3 line is completely new from the ground up.
So at the moment there are 2 S&X lines, and 1 fancy new 3 line.

Pretty sure they plan on adding additional lines for the 3 once they get all the kinks ironed out.  Once that original line is humming along (No longer in production hell) they will just replicate it using the knowledge learned from building the initial one. "
"First production *cargo*. As in, the battery packs in the trailer are production parts to be installed in Model 3's.

These are clearly the same two trucks from the reveal event, and it's relatively ""easy"" to make two prototypes that work good enough to use in the reveal. I would imagine there's still a great deal of testing and refinement that needs to be done before the trucks themselves are production ready."
"How do you know that the disguisted trucks have moved loads. I've heard of the Semi's driving in disguise, but not moving loads. and since this is the first production cargo, your story seems to not check out.  
  
What's your source?  
  
Edit: you are right, if you mean ""the mule"" they might have been testing with."
The black one will probably platoon behind the silver one to make up for the lack of fairing. 
"I also think they're probably going to have some great range when you consider all that downhill breaking from Reno's 4900 elevation to fremonts near 0 over donner pass 
"
Do we have any confirmation that the black one is indeed short range?
And gear ratio.
Thanks Perd Hapley
"I think ""quite far"" is a more accurate estimate."
This is a retarded idea. You cannot charge a battery that you are actively discharging at the rate Teslas do while driving.
"Tesla Semi is supposed to be able to do anything a normal semi can, and that's how they move F9 to the launch site currently "
"All they had before the announcement was wind tunnels, test tracks and using the mules that didn't look like, or have the aerodynamics of the final vehicle.

Real world results vary from these things, and now they can drive these two vehicles on a multi hundred mile trip with wildly varying conditions.

They will definitely get new and interesting real world results from these trips that they simply just couldn't get before the big reveal, and will be able to provide more accurate differences between a top/topless vehicle."
"Using your figures....  36 packs per semi, and Tesla wants to move 5,000 3's a week out of Fremont in June?  That's a lot of trucks bringing in packs...

(Nearly 20 trucks a day @ 36 packs each just to maintain 5,000 per week)

/edit. That's nuts to think they will need basically a truck delivering packs once per hour, every hour, of every day, to maintain a 5,000 per week rate.   And they want to hit 10k a week later on?  No wonder they are trying to sort traffic around the factory.   That's not even factoring in S & X, and all the other parts coming and going.

/edit 2. This is where rail comes in handy.  Basically unlimited weight possibilities, and the tracks run from GF1 to Fremont.(Not directly, but you know what I mean)  You could ship a lot of packs using fully loaded trains."
How?  In this thread?
"Plus, it's the easiest area to apply their Autopilot towards - mostly highway driving.  Imagine a world where the truck driver pulls truck up to the trailer, drives it to the edge of the lot, checks the GPS route, gets out of the cab, then the truck drives all the way to the next lot, including automated stops for recharging at superchargers, either using that crazy tentacle charger thing or just have a guy at a specialized truck supercharger whose job is to get in the truck at the edge of the lot, pull it up to the charger, start the charge, then when it's done he re-checks the GPS route and tells the truck to leave.  Once it gets to the destination another trucker gets in and backs the trailer into a dock.

It used to be that we'd have to pay a trucker for the many many hours spent on the road.  Labor could be cut by an order of magnitude or more with this."
It is not easy to have a megawatt charger on every farm...
"At the speeds yard tractors operate at, 1000 mile ranges are attainable.  The P100D has been real-world demonstrated to get 670 miles of range at a speed of 25 miles per hour already."
[Why would you mow your own lawn like some kind of neanderthal?](https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/best-robot-lawnmowers/2/)
Doesn't LA Port operate some cobbled-together tractors to move containers around?
"Surely there would be challenges, but a little positive thinking does not hurt. An electric tractor would mean less fuel cost and a lot more pulling power (so maybe faster planting and harvest with larger pulled equipment?). For 24-hour operation we need battery changes, but I don't see this impossible when we're talking about an ugly tractor. I can imagine the whole front being a large detachable battery, lol."
"That may be true for a lot of midwest guys, but I'm in California and my tractors are running all year. Assuming there's enough power, which the semi's make me think it can, I just need to know it can run long enough before I have to recharge it.

We can end up running 16 hour days or more. Just today I was looking up EV UTV's for our irrigators, who also can end up working that many hours and the battery's only last 2 hours. It's gotta atleast make it to lunch where they can charge it in 30 min or so. (All our drip stations are electric so I assume I could plug in there with the right hook up.)"
"Ag equipment stays out in fields for long periods so charging would be impractical. Also, like you said they don't sit still for very long during peak times so charging would be impractical, UNLESS there was a way to remove the battery and charge one while using the other."
"Tractors will need swappable batteries. Then I think they will be possible. But they would need to be able to swap with other equipment or work as backup generators.

It's one of those places where I think heavy duty swappable batteries of around 100-250 kWh could be good."
"Sitting unused is something EV does better than ICE.  The caveat being, you want a regular low power 120v house outlet on the vehicle as a battery tender to keep it at a maintenance 50% load.  The payoff is ther eis no big mothballing needed before putting the engine away, or maintenance come spring when you take it out.  ICE engines are destroyed by sitting still for too long, they have seals that need lubrication and don't get it when sitting, dry seals can blow an engine.  EV has 10% of the moving parts and none of the seals to dry out.  The only worry is letting a battery go undervolt too far for too long, but on a tender you can leave an EV sitting until the tires go flat and rot, and still just drive it off when you come back without the startup oil changes etc."
"Having grown up on a farm, I can confirm that electric tractors are a long way from being a reality. The energy demand is simply too massive and recharging is way too slow. Heavy tillage can burn north of 25 gallons of diesel per hour... "
I found dad!
Only if it rains...
Would buy!
How about a Tesla motorcycle?
"Pity we can't get in-wheel motors for ICE conversions. With 100% regen braking, we can dispose of the mechanical brakes on at least the drive wheels, reducing unsprung weight."
"Pop the frunk, it's time to unload this monster."
"That's like the Falcon Heavy bot that pushed the schedule every time someone mentioned it, right?"
"Semi trucks are built just like massive pickups from an assembly line standpoint. The bodies still require significant hand welding.

I don't know about the full body assembly but I have a feeling Tesla is going to to lean heavy on CF components for body parts."
I have a feeling semi chassis construction will be outsourced and Tesla will create the power train. Specialization like that could really speed things up.
As a buyer: nothing.  As a shareholder: woo profit
That only means every test build will be doing real work for the company. 
"These two are, yes."
win-win
"Also, even though it's kind of in the middle of nowhere, it's close to both a major interstate and a major rail hub.  Both make shipping easier.   It's just a few hours from Fremont, so it's far, but not too far."
"It wasn‚Äôt that sweet compared to how much money they are spending on the Gigafactory in NV. Musk has talked about it. I think it only applies as a tax rebate on capital investments or something like that. Someone correct me, I know that probably isn‚Äôt quite right."
"The Clayton Valley in NV is still one of the best sources of lithium in the world, second only to the region in south america referred to as the lithium triangle.

*woosh*
It was a jab at how long it took the 3's to get to manufacturing and how the trucks were announced recently and they're already being put to use. Poor attempt at humor - Sorry.
I am surprised that greens does not push for EV incentives. We need better air a nd hyperloop should be the way we travel down under. 
"True facts, I'm just saying I find it amusing."
"I meant this truck, loaded with batteries... Not prior sightings. "
Those emission certifications will be hard to get
Whyyyyy!
That‚Äôs great to hear. Forward thinking.
Its advantage is that they don't need different manufacturing for left driving countries
I used Google bike for a back of the envelope. 
"It's more like 4,600'."
"I think he means they are not empty or with ""dummy payloads"", but rather, as you said, actual cargo needed at Fremont."
[deleted]
"Modern battery technology simply isn't viable to carry heavy roads cross country, you get downvote brigaded if you mention this however :L

Honestly i love tesla and all that, but we need to start building a *shittone* of nuclear reactors to pull of the switch to electric we need so much, and we need longer lasting and more affordable batteries for big trucks."
" You are correct, Sir. This is from 2015.

 Coal (18%)

  Natural Gas (31%)

  Hydro (3%)

  Nuclear (8%)

  Oil (37%)

  Others (Renew.) (3%)"
I have to wonder how many press cars will be following along on the trip to see how it goes.
If only there was some kind of camera that was already installed that faced the road.
Or someone from reno could follow the truck the entire way?
That would be a sweet advertisement. The cab photos are awesome.
So long as he doesn‚Äôt need a bathroom break
"> diesel generators

Uh, what?"
Even powerpacks are reasonably sexy as it goes.
"I think its quite a bit net downhill, so probably a pretty safe trip considering they shouldnt be bringing too much weight back to Nevada."
a 100kwh hour tesla battery weighs order of  1200lbs so that's ~40 of them in a load which sounds about right
That could drive to Argentina
"That makes sense, they could just recharge them all in Fremont "
The cynic in me thinks this is the case. No way they are going to let it even potentially fail on such a highly publicized run. There is extra juice available in my opinion.
"Tesla delivering a vehicle on time?

That's amusing."
In the picture they have side mirrors
"They are using them only for Tesla purposes because there is a relatively high likelihood of something going wrong, this is just doing testing with a meaningful payload.  "
Some crazy person shooting it or damaging it in some other way.
"A public company is free to make special deals with any other company for whatever reason. For example, Apple gives special access to a chosen few developers before the public release of a feature or SDK."
"Right, but the first stage is about 40 meters long. They would need a special trailer to carry it, while being very careful. That would be like carrying a bit more than a windmill blade, if you've seen that done before.

Edit: You guys need to calm down. My comment was hardly dissenting. There's no room in this sub for any real discussion it seems."

BFR would still be doable depending on the size of the stages
"Exactly. One of the ways SpaceX was able to cut costs in a common sense way: build your rocket with an extra skinny profile so it can be hauled across country on the interstate. 

This also frees you up to manufacture the rockets in more competitive employment markets (e.g. Falcon 9 can be built in California. The Delta IV rocket is built in Alabama, because it needs to be sent to Florida on a boat)."
"I would call those engineering development units, rather than ""alpha prototypes""."
Check the VINs.

"Totally.  There wasn't big fanfare over the introduction of these trucks.  That's actually a good thing.  They are simply about saving the operators money, and once we reach that point it all changes.  All the hard work of science, engineering, and subsidies pays off. 

(These trucks have 700kWh battery packs!)"
"Much industrial equipment has been partially or fully electric for over 100 years, even predating internal combustion engines."
"Added a link to my comment.

EDIT: Note that these are electric trucks.  Not diesel-electric.  They have 700kWh batteries"
"Hook up to an inverter -> power goes from the battery, converts to AC in the inverter -> power delivered to the grid.

They don't run the trucks 24/7, there is down time to offload to the grid."
No.  The mass of material being brought from the top of the mine down is the source of energy (potential energy -> electricity).
Wow.
Top notch comment right here. 
"Or maybe it's because Oakland has an elevation of 43' and Reno has an elevation of 4,506'? 

(Even if you're in a higher part of the East Bay, you're at most at 1000' instead of 4500')"
"It's mostly down hill to the ocean from Reno. But hell as many trips as I have made from Reno to Vegas and back, I've noticed the improved mileage heading to Vegas as Vegas is 1200' or so."
"You're just talking about state regulations for mirrors, but states don't regulate the substitution of cameras for mirrors. That is under control of the feds, NHTSA specifically via a 1968 rule that specifies that street legal vehicles must have a minimum of one external sideview mirror and a mirror mounted to the windshield. I know as of 2014 NHTSA specifically forbade camera-only rearview systems. Cameras could supplement mirrors but they couldn't replace them.

Some auto manufacturers, including Tesla, [were petitioning NHTSA in '14](https://www.wired.com/2014/04/tesla-auto-alliance-mirrors/) to change the regs, but I don't know if they succeeded. "
"And almost certainly they use model3 battery modules. 

Perhaps there is some crossover on the interior parts also. Screens and computers and plastic bits.

"Stuck in a truck 24/7 is hardly what I'd describe as ""lucky""."
"I should add, having 2 S & X lines is helpful as they constantly are changing S & X production with improvements and whatnot.   One line keeps cranking out S & X, while the 2nd line is retooled for updates.  Then once the second line is all dialed in for new updates, they primarily use that while going back and doing the same on the other line.  It's part of what made the constant improvements to S & X possible over the last few years, as opposed to ""model year"" changes like most other manufacturers do."
"You need to specify between General Assembly and Body lines.

Originally there was one GA line and one Body line, both for S. A new GA line was brought up for S/X around 2014, and the old one was dismantled. A new body line was built in its place for X, so there were two body lines (one each S/X) and a single combo GA line. 

3 has ground-up new lines for both Body and GA."
"The problem wasn't particularly the improperly functioning lines but also Tesla's adherence towards skipping the 'pre-production' testing phase to proceed in a rapid but careless fashion, which lead to more errors & the requirement of extensive QC leading up to regular delays & hindrances in the line's operation. They might apply their newfound expertise towards the Model Y but Musk clarified that it'll be a separate platform.

I'm more concerned about available space inside the factory, GM & Toyota were able to have dual lines to produce half a million cars which was reported to be above the theoretical maximum albeit Tesla has made several significant changes since then, but looks like even with outsourcing a few of the Model 3 part lines to the Gigafactory, I doubt there'll be space for the Semi and/or Y.

Makes me wonder given their financial situation, whether they'll acquire or build a new factory or expand the current one. Or they might use their [Netherlands assembly plant](https://www.tesla.com/sv_SE/blog/tesla-motors-opens-assembly-plant-tilburg-netherlands) which many don't know about, which would certainly be ambitious."
"They were videotaped and uploaded 2 years ago moving pickups from tesla suppliers.  The prototypes moving loads looked nothing like the current production ready builds, and probably weren't using the model 3 motors yet.  That's probably why this newest production build wasn't hauling loads yet, it's changed a lot since those earlier preproduction models."
"You got things to move? Got a truck that moves things you need tested before *other* people are comfortable with it? Why not?

It's called ""all-up"" testing.

Worked for Falcon 9.

You just don't pick mission critical loads. Use them for odd jobs and picking up slack and such until they are broke in."
"Does Nevada and California law recognize that, or will the back person get a ticket for following too close?"
"Maybe you can't  with current models, but there are plenty of technical solutions that may enable recharging while driving. The real challenge seems regulatory. "
Skip the rail and hyperloop it. A small palette of batteries every 15 minutes. 
"Sure, create an Imgur mirror and copy the link here."
"The analogy I like to use is that of a Harbor Pilot.

When large ships come into port they're captained not by the individual who got them there but by a specialized harbor pilot who knows the ins and out of that specific harbor.
"
"This is a nightmare for the railroads.  They're currently in a fight to get locomotive crews down to two, let alone driverless.  
Australia and Europe already use single-crew trains, and Rio Tinto (Western Australia) is well into it's own trials of driverless trains."
"Why even have a driver cabin at that point? I'm sure it'd be a lot cheaper if it wasn't designed to accommodate the driver, who could instead do complex tasks like backing it into the dock remotely."
"Tractors are IMHO even easier to automate.  There is a company just a couple of miles away from where I live that are doing just that, where you can program a tractor to plow a field by simply drawing its path on a tablet and letting it go about its business.

An agriculture tractor is a pretty versatile piece of equipment which can do a whole lot of useful things.  The only difference I might see is that there are more semi-tractors around than agriculture tractors.  If it was strictly an economic decision on the part of Tesla, it makes perfect sense.

I have no doubt that Tesla will move into agri-business eventually, where more than a few farmers would be willing to have solar farms on the outbuilding's roofs along with a Powerwall or two on premises simply to have a reliable source of power to the farm."
"That's why I'm against it.  More profits for business owners at the expense of decent jobs.

We need a law saying there has to be 1 driver for 2 semis.  

I also just don't want such monstrous vehicles self piloting on the road with me unattended.  People will intentionally fuck with them constantly."
"Grid connection fee for that power would be insane, but solar panels and batteries would work well"
Not very hard either. A 1.6 MW Megacharger could be taken care of by 2 acres of solar panels and a 500 kWh battery storage unit. 
"You may not need a MW charger and farms have access to and use a significant amount of power already. 300 kW charge rate may be reasonable.

It seems like a combine is consuming one gallon per acre at around 22 acres per hour
https://talk.newagtalk.com/forums/thread-view.asp?tid=72369&DisplayType=flat&setCookie=1

114,000 btu per gallon of diesel. Call the EV twice as efficient.
I'm calling that 16.7 kWh per acre. At 22 acres per hour is 367.4 kWh per hour.

You'd need a 3-4 MW pack to make it practical. Farmers often rent the combines by the day so they're worried about more than fuel costs.

For a conventional tractor it may be more reasonable. I picked a combine as a worst case scenario. 
 "
Cheaper to build and easier to get out the door as they don't have all the regulations of normal tractors. Much less range so you don't need as many batteries. Less axles means you don't need as many motors. I can see companies lining up to buy these.

Tractors are in the unusual position of driving all day without ever leaving home. That makes battery swaps practical. The $50+ per hour of diesel tractors burn will pay for those batteries pretty quickly too.
"And the Falcon Heavy bot, because it was shutdown pretty quickly, actually ended up _under_-estimating the final launch date by a few months."
"Carbon fibre for the semi? That seems absurd, but I'd love to see it."
"Let's see, a few hundred/grand in fuel per trip, a few tens of millions in development costs.

Buckle up, we're in for a long ROI!

^(And I'm ok with that!)"
"Tesla needs to conserve cash, right? What better way to conserve cash than take batteries you can produce at cost and avoid the need for expensive fossil fuel transportation between GF1 and Fremont, as well as transporting lithium from their mining operation ~200 miles south of GF1."
"Just saying these particular ones aren‚Äôt new prototypes as the previous comment was suggesting. Even if they were, I don‚Äôt see anything wrong in getting some work done while testing your own products."
"It's also very close to their lithium evaporation mining partner. The state of Nevada modified a truck route to make it even more convenient.

[One way is 192 miles from mine to GF1](https://goo.gl/maps/VGbjW4BQEey).

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigafactory_1#Factory_location

>Nevada estimates a tax base of $1.9 billion over 20 years.[38] After sticky negotiations,[51] Tesla chose the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center (TRIC) as the location of the Gigafactory mainly due to speed[47] and a State of Nevada incentive package. Other location reasons were rail access, direct sale ability,[43][49] and low air humidity.[52]

.

>The incentives include $195 million in transferable tax credits depending on Tesla's investment schedule and job creation, similar to the Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant deal and others.[36][50][51][53] Tesla's investments earn them about $10 million in tax credits per quarter,[54][55][56] and by July 2016 had sold these for $20 million cash.[57] At the end of 2016, Tesla and Panasonic had 477 employees and 5,591 construction workers, mostly Nevada residents, and invested $1.1b earning $59m in tax credits.[58]

>The incentive package also includes 20 years free from sales tax and 10 years free from property tax, depending on Tesla's ability to meet performance expectations (like investing $3.5 billion in Nevada).[36][51] By 2034, this package could have accumulated to a value of $1.25 billion in missed taxes; the 10th largest in the US. The $725M sales tax abatement was particularly important, as 5 other states charge no sales tax at all and 34 states, including Arizona and Texas, don't charge sales tax on manufacturing equipment.[36][50] With a tax base of $1.9 billion and an incentive package of $1.25 billion, the projected end result was calculated as a tax-per-abatement ratio of 1.52.[37][47][59] The nearby data centers from Apple Inc. and Switch also received incentives.[47][60]

>Nevada estimates the construction impact at $2.4 billion and the economic impact from the project at $100 billion over two decades ($5 billion/year, of which $353 million are wages).[37][38] Some economists said that number was ""deeply flawed"", for instance, it counted every Tesla employee as if they would otherwise have been unemployed and made no allowance for increased government spending to serve the influx of thousands of local residents.[8][61][62][63][64][65][66] Tesla agreed to pay $7.5M per year for 5 years ($37.5M) to the school system.[36]"
"There will be **$275,000 fine** for the lack of ""Clean Air Act Certificate of Conformity"" no doubt! ;P

That's a manufacturing advantage not a user advantage. 
"Correct! No doubt Tesla did the math to optimize charge level leaving Reno and Fremont. I am betting no charging except at destinations and little charging at Reno. The question is how long they charge at each end and if they drop and pick up trailers or leave the trailer hooked up while unloading.

Edit: Doing napkin math, they only need to charge the big Semi in Fremont or Reno, not both."
Tesla is a lot more dependant on good macros than google or Apple who are swimming in cash. You should track down the performance against the S&P or DOW 
Spoke too soon 
"Yes nobody flew until the Wright brothers built the airplane... If your argument is it can't be done...you are wrong , if your argument is it can't be done now then you are short sighted"
This guys Teslas...
"From Reno.  I would do this, but work prevents me from the greater good."
Somebody call the bandit.
Tesla doesn‚Äôt advertise. It‚Äôs the strangest thing!
NASA lent some diapers.
"I was referring to the rather industrial box like shape of diesel generators. They are omnipresent so figured they'd make for a good example. My guess is that's how Megachargers would look like, so not as pretty as the Superchargers."
"Reno is at about 4500 feet, the Gigafactory maybe 200' more. Donner at I80 is 7240', Fremont CA is probably 56'. "
"There‚Äôs a lot of Japanese batteries going into this packs, too. I don‚Äôt believe the gigafactory is making 18650‚Äôs yet, so it‚Äôs possible they have a return load. "
"Assuming an average of 65 kWh installed 2170 capacity per Model 3, each Semi can carry enough packs to produce 60 of 'em, or roughly a cool $2.7 million in cars at an ASP of $45k from the packs delivered per Semi trip."
"Okay, so we know the Tesla semi can go 500 miles on 1 mWh of energy at 80,000lb gross weight limit, and we know the powerpacks are roughly 200kWh per 3600lb. 

With some very generous weight assumptions for the semi and a lightweight trailer, you might get 15 powerpacks in there and hooked up, or another 3 megawatts, which would give it a range of ~2000 miles.

"
"You know there is no road from the USA to Argentina right?

There is a marsh in the way in Panama and nobody can be bothered to build a road over it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-American_Highway"
"Only to comply with current regulations to allow Tesla to run them on public roads. If they get the regulatory approval by next year when these go on sale, they'll substitute mirrors for cameras to favour aerodynamic efficiencies."
"Which is pretty smart, I don‚Äôt see what the issue is "
Oh yeah I guess that happens in america
"They already do, that's how they ship them. It's why F9 is so skinny, almost ridiculously so. It's literally the biggest thing you can ship by road without taking things apart along the way."
"Absolutely they would need a special trailer. However, I don't think that Tesla will let a custom trailer stop them from attempting this. Lol"
"Even the smaller of the BFR's two stages is still bigger than the [shuttle external tank](https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2016/05/23/02e0d471-263b-4a8c-b8bd-4e7370019ce7/en0522okitashuttle.jpg).

So while it might technically be possible to transport by road as they did with the shuttle tank, the logistics would be a nightmare.

Especially since they'd be moving it 2600 miles instead of 16, and they'd have to remove some bridges and overpasses and the like."
Engineering Validation Test Units(?)
"Eh, the batteries catch fire sometimes..."
"So looking again, the article does say they do ~20 trips a day, so only 200 kWh of excess per day, which means they could go the whole shift without discharging. So actually does seem feasible.

That said, I'm actually kinda surprised they're only doing 20 trips a day. Normally a truck like this actually does run nearly 24/7. Or at least two ~11hr shifts per day. Considering the cost of a piece of equipment like this (ICE or EV), and the profit that it makes when running, it doesn't generally make sense to have it sitting around for half the day. Yes, there is maintenance downtime required, but that is usually just a few hours a week."
That‚Äôs a good point. For sure in an ideal system the overall elevation change would be the only important factor. I am no physicist and have no idea how things like rolling/wind resistance and engine efficiency would affect it.
NHTSA also prevents automatic highbeam headlights. As they still mandate a switch for high beams.
They just use more of the same motor. It's a versatile design.
It probably has a different reduction gear and they use 4 of those motors to provide more than adequate hp for hauling. The Semi has enough power that it can continue to operate(at reduced capacity) even if 1-2 of the motors fail.
Gears are a hell of a drug. 
"EDIT: I see u/paulwesterberg answered below! disregard this comment. 

They're possibly connected to different stepdown gears, but to our knowledge the motors themselves are essentially unmodified."
"Luckier to be in an BEV semi than a diesel monster. If someone cuts you up and you're forced to slow down, you don't then spend the next minute getting back up to speed!"
"Yea I wasn't very clear in my post, but what you wrote there is basically how I heard it.

During my visit to the factory in November, you only saw the GA line with both S & X rolling down along it.    You get hints of the body assembly (and stamping) but not too much.

We saw parts of the 3 line, but it wasn't moving, and at that point in time everything was covered as best it could by panels and giant sheets hanging from the ceiling to keep prying eyes out."
"Oh there's no chance in hell they will be able to fit Y & Semi lines in Fremont.  They've stated that several times.  (Sidenote, Elon backtracked and said Y will be based on the 3 platform after initially saying it would be all new).

Regardless, they will need some new factories built for both Semi & Y, or they will use GF1 space for one or both.   I'd wager Semi at GF1 as it won't be in crazy numbers like the Y will probably be.

Dunno where they are going to build the Y.  They will need to get Europe and China 3 factories up and running at some point also.  Lots of capital expenditures ahead."
"Nope, not gonna go there"
"That would be awesome, but in the meantime rail is still the best option.  You could deliver 1000's of packs daily using rail, and not clog up the roads in the process.   

Sadly I think they actually ripped out the tracks that used to go into Fremont.  I know they used them in the NUMI days, but it appears Tesla has backed away from using rail straight in/out of the factory.

/edit they do ship cars across country using rail though, but they load the cars out of a different location and not direct from Fremont."
"Sorry I've never done that, so idk.  Maybe i will look into it later on after work."
Tractor automation has been around for a quite a few years now
"You want to create bullshit make-work jobs?  You want to regulate that there must be bullshit make-work jobs?  I mean, I get that it's a shitload of people suddenly massively unemployed or underemployed but this is *not* a viable long-term solution because it'll go under hard and fast by lobbyists for shipping companies that want to keep labor costs down to be competitive.  If you want to help the drivers, actually try to HELP the drivers by demanding retraining programs, put them to work where there's actually work."
"I don't think so for some of the larger tractors.

A decent-sized tillage tractor that we have on the farm (170-180 hp) can go through 80 gallons of fuel in an 8-hour shift. Times the energy density of diesel fuel, divided by time, I'm getting 0.37 MJ/s (370kW), times a typical 35% energy efficiency comes out to  ~130kW of useful work. (Which converts back into 172 hp - pretty accurate!)

So we're going to have to match that with solar collectors. IIRC, we get ~1kW/m^2 in terms of sunlight on a cloudless day at high noon, and the best photovoltaics are 20-30% efficient. To match the power output of this one tractor, we're going to need 433m^2 of photovoltaics, and that's not factoring in charging and discharging efficiency. Then add in solar's capacity factor of 12-30%, and we're getting 1500-3600m^2 of photovoltaics to run this damn thing! 

Now, a tractor has downtime, and is definitely not run the entire year, but many run continuously, in overcast weather, through the night even, and many tillage tractors are much bigger (350-500 hp-- 2-3x larger).

So the amount of photovoltaics we need to run tractors is *huge*, much bigger than the area available on the tractor and implement, and put out in rural areas where it's hard to get even a regular grid connection out to. Then assuming that you have a centralized location to charge your batteries, you'll need a big logistics setup to move them. You'll have to trust me on this part, but I once figured that you'd have to swap out a battery the size of the entire front end of a tractor every four hours or so unless volumetric efficiency gets a lot better.

So we'll need a shitload of solar cells, or a LOT of tractor-sized batteries topped up beforehand, with sheds to store them, trucks to move them back and forth... 

Call me skeptical, but I think ICE still looks good in this role."
"Most of the commercial yard tractor regs are emissions and noise.   Somebody should start making these now, it seems like a winning investment."
"Oh, that kind of Yard. [There was an electric hauler put in serve at the LA port in 2010](https://www.wired.com/2010/04/electric-truck-can-haul-a-trailer-of-teslas/) by Balqon Corportation [which seems to have been acquired by Chinese battery company Winston](http://en.winston-battery.com/index.php/news/121-balqon-corporation-became-a-new-member-of-winston)"
"I once ran the numbers and figured that you'd need to swap out a battery the size of the entire front end of a present-day tractor every four hours or so.

Call me skeptical, but I think that's going to be pretty hard to do in BFE. "
I can't find my napkin math I'd previously posted but I have a feeling Tesla is going to be fighting extremely hard to keep the weight in line with an ICE tractor. Every way I did the math the EV drivetrain (with batteries) was roughly double the weight of the ICE drive train. To not cut into payload they need to find creative ways to shave pounds from the chassis in other ways.
I'm just used to the development process being so wasteful. Having the even the 1st prototypes doing real work would be a dream come true. 
Its user advantage if left hand countries can buy Semis erlier
Are you having a stroke?
I got to see them at the Gigafactory today. Very cool!!
The greater good!
I know they don‚Äôt. But just like they don‚Äôt advertise and we‚Äôre all looking at this Instagram post I was insinuating they could do the same thing with a time lapse or something of a video from the cab.

"Oh ok, I thought you were saying that the Megachargers would be powered by diesel generators haha"
Have they switched over to 2070's yet?
Or in gold it can carry a cool billion
Yeah but how much does the electricity add to the weight?
"Yes, I know, I just wanted to make a joke. I'd like Elon to make a tunnel there, but that might be very difficult"
"Last time we built something in Panama, we gave it away."
"Or, like every other car they've prototyped without the mirrors and then added later, they'll stick side mirrors on it if the regulations don't change."
"People want Elon to fail because he really throws it in humanity's face how fucking lazy we've been, and when he succeeds they have to be pessimistic otherwise face admitting he is actually pretty awesome"
There isn't an issue and I'm not saying there is. This is definitely smart. My point is that these trucks aren't out of testing just yet and in fact it's most likely just begun. 
Lol Wut? Vandalism happens everywhere you nitwit
Don't they already use a special one?
"Oh, absolutely not. "
"First by boat is how I'm guessing they will move them. Then eventually, when they are flying regularly point to point, they will just launch from wherever the final plant goes. Maybe build a BFFactory out next to the Gigafactory."
"I'd expect a more iterative design process so less validation, more development, but I'm just guessing."
"They go slowww when loaded. You also have to average in loading/unloading times. Depending on the mine, 20runs/day seems like a reasonable estimate.

But they do run nearly 24/7 currently. Downtime being maintenance and crew shifts. 

CAT is in the process of testing 100% automated dump trucks in some gold mines in South America. Guaranteed those will be running 24/7/365 with maintenance downtime being the plague.

Cool thing about the automated dump trucks, they allow for mines of *much* smaller footprint, dramatically increase worker safety, and save some big money. 

One of the most dangerous jobs in open pit mining is driving the dump truck out of the pit. Pit walls are very steep, roads are very narrow (for humans driving 30ft wide trucks), traffic commonly goes both ways, and [collapses](http://earthsky.org/earth/this-date-in-science-landslide-at-bingham-canyon-mine) are ""common"" enough that road construction out of the pit is done very carefully and done with very large margins for error/safety. 

If you don't have to worry about worker safety... 100% automated trucks allow for very narrow roads (<1ft margins) and very steep pit walls."
"Things like slopes of elevation change and wind resistance would play a part.

e.g. If you went from 4,500' to 4,500' but dipped down to sea level in between, then one way will almost certainly be more efficient than the other. A little bit.

But unless you're fighting a huge headwind one way vs a huge tailwind the other way, or one way is a nice gentle slope the entire way and the other is a huge drop off a cliff...  I'd wager the massive elevation change plays a bigger part.

Let's do some math... For the sake of simple math lets weight a Model S 75D with no passengers at 2,000kg (it's actually a bit more) Also let's assume you're climbing 1300m (a bit under 4,500')

(Note this figure is very unrealistic because - since you're passing multiple mountain ranges - your *actual* elevation change is much higher than 4,500' since you go up and down multiple times at less than perfect efficiency)

The potential energy gain of your gain is 2000kg * 1300m * 9.8m/s^2 == 25.48MJ.  

The usable capacity of a 75D is 72.6kwh, or 261.36MJ, so you're using just under 10% of the battery capacity just to climb.

If usage at cruise speed in your Model S is 333 wh/mi, that means you expend 1.198MJ to go one mile, so it takes over 21 miles of range just to raise the car 4,500'

And all of the above numbers are assuming 100% efficiency. Of course it actually takes *more* than 25.48MJ to raise the car this much.

Can a difference in slope account for this big of a chunk of energy? Yes, but probably not in a form that exists on public roads between the East Bay and Reno.

Can wind resistance differences account for a 10% swing in range? Sure, in specific weather conditions comparing a huge headwind vs a huge tailwind. But probably not ""every day differences""

But the elevation change is constant."
Almost like SpaceX and the Falcon rockets. Modular design FTW.
"The Model 3 motor is a very useful design.  Variations of it are being used in the 3, Semi and 2020 Roadster.  It's a pretty safe bet you will see it in the Model Y also when it's announced."
These two semis have two different gear ratios.
Aren‚Äôt these vehicles about torque > HP?
You also have heat/air and whatever else whenever you want it. Not to mention it is silent so naps will be awesome while some jack wagon takes 4 hours to unload your trailer.

"Lets run the numbers. Let's look at the John Deere 9620. It uses about 18 gallons per hour to produce about 300 HP for typical use which is about 225 kW. It weighs 18 tons an can be loaded with another 7 tons of weights. it's around a $500,000 dollar piece of equipment. To run about 4 hours, you would need 900kWh of battery. this would weigh about 6 tons and take up a space of about 2 feet by 4 feet by 9 feet. The cost of 2 such batteries would be around $200,000. Tractors already have hydraulics for lifting and switching the batteries. It sounds pretty workable."
Do we know if the semi chassis is steel or aluminum yet?
"I wouldn't be surprised if other truck makers have done this in the past, it seems logical, the difference is that the semi will be more cost effective."
No getting your truck sooner doesn't erase the issues created for the driver by centered seating.

"No, it's because unlike blind fanboys most of us like things to be truthful instead of misleading. Yes the truck will do a meaningful delivery but no, the trucks aren't in operation meaning out of the testing phase. It's just like FH, instead of putting something really meaningless in the cargo they're putting something useful on a useful trip. It's for dogfooding and some free PR. Wise decision."
Fanboy much? Lol no one is attacking Elon here

They do. There is literally no reason the Semi couldn't do it instead of the other trucks.

Definitely!
"Such a versatile part is a great asset as improvements/refinements benefit your entire product line and economies of scale can push down unit costs.

Kind of like the AC-DC rectifier Tesla uses for AC vehicle charging and in parallel stacks in Supercharger cabinets. It has undergone 3 process shrinks since the Model S was launched making it cheaper, smaller and higher power."

"Good! Your numbers line up well with mine, and I was basing it off of a JD 4850 (a 190 PTO hp tractor, run a little slower in her old age) that burns about 8-10 gallons per hour.

I should have added ""and charge"" to my OP, because where I think the hard part comes in at is in charging the batteries.

For your 900kWh battery you need a minimum of a 225kW supply, plus time to shuttle the battery back and forth between your tractor and your charging station, and inefficiency in charging the thing, so let's call it an even 240kW to make the numbers easy on the ol' noggin'. 

So at 240V, that's ~1000 amps, 500 amps if you've got 480V like some of the big guys have on their grain setup. Now, I ain't a professional pixie wrangler, not even an elec-chicken, but those numbers sound big to a guy used to household current. And if we check our figures and it all back into the realm of sanity for a moment, are you running a 300 hp motor off your grid connection?"
"It looks like a CFRP body is being heavily reported (news to me, I thought I was being perceptive) I've not seen anything on the frame construction. With the modern material available I can't see them going with anything else than an ultra high strength steel frame. All modern semis use a similar design. You can't cut, drill or weld on them for obvious reasons. "
"That implies it creates issues for drivers, which I am doubtful about, we'll only know when they are out there in numbers."
"I'm sorry i genuinely cant understand what your trying to say right now, is English a secondary language or something, i simply dont understand.

Hilariously your using a logical fallacy against me by accusing me of an ad homien, a ['Argument from fallacy'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_fallacy) fallacy specifically, note i never tried to insult you i had no idea what you were saying."
Absolutely! I don‚Äôt think I saw a single person who wasn‚Äôt taking pics. I‚Äôm surprised I haven‚Äôt seen any on here 
"That's 13.3 grams, the little boy atomic bomb converted only 0.7 grams into, well, quite a bit more energy than a trailer of batteries.

I got 0.00000016kg, or 0.00016 grams, less than 1/4000th the energy of the little boy, which sounds a lot more reasonable.

Oh and btw, you can directly convert watt-hours to joules, just multiply it by 3600(number of seconds in an hour). So 4mWh is 14.4 gigajoules.

"
"I don‚Äôt think you can just ignore the per second part though.

I know we are being goofy...but let‚Äôs be goofy ‚Äúseriously‚Äù.

Those are flow units so we would need to know how long that 4 MW was rated for.  I saw something when google researching that said the capacities are usually measured over a 20 window...so 4 MW/20 hr.

If you convert the hours to seconds and the MW to W....should allow you to cancel out the second u its and leave you with just J...that you can use in E=mc2.

At least that‚Äôs how I would do it."
"> clearly regulators will have to listen with haste.

I mean I hope so, I just don't have a lot of faith in U.S. regulators moving ""with haste"" on anything.

IIRC, Japan (and maybe some European countries?) have dropped the requirement for side mirrors. So that would seem to bode well that things will move that direction.

I just wanted to point out that their lack of inclusion in the revealed prototypes doesn't really mean anything other than Tesla not *wanting* to put mirrors on there... but they didn't want to put them on their other vehicles either."
Any links?
"Its phrased the way it needs to be to break through to the average person.

Makes sense tbh
"They used to put airfields out away from populated areas for the exact same obvious reasons.

Plus with point to point and a little extra fuel you can fly around the populated areas, if you aren't headed to orbit you don't have to fly in a straight line. So you never end up over a populated area. And even then only when they are flying as safe as aircraft.

Ninja Edit: This post got away from me, but I really really like the idea of building ""SpaceX Land"" in Reno. Call it code name... BFC (Casino), since it would dwarf everything in Reno.

Plus Reno may love rocket tourism, instead of just being a smaller shitty Vegas. Build a rocket and science themed casino. Build a SpaceX and Tesla science center for the kids, with a Hypertube connecting it to the factory doing tours behind glass. For the adults closed track Tesla rentals (or ride, the casino can provide professional drivers) for drag racing or time trials around the track, and gambling. Top of the building would be dedicated to high powered auto tracking telescopes people can pay to use to watch launches while piping the feed into the casino. On the weekends at night professional Tesla track racing. Elon made a tweet once about the new Roadster being able to fly short distances, put in a jump or two :) or go for the loop, like that crazy video game from the 90s Stunt Driver I think it was called. Use self driving mode over the really dangerous parts, just don't advertise the fact, also how you test it without humans aboard.

Though I can see SpaceX building a transporter deeper into the desert because of sound, Spaceport America isn't that far away, then launch from there to all points further. I still woudn't count that as ""shipping"".

Edit: Finally a use for airships! Air lift them from the Gigafactory to Spaceport America. The desert at night is great for gas bag flying bums [like this](https://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/a25180/airlander-10-ready-to-fly-again/). Just have to go much much bigger. Ferry rockets during the night and passengers from Spaceport America during the day as a novelty. Then Tesla and SpaceX would have access to a super heavy lift airship asset, like for shipping TBMs out into the middle of nowhere for Hypertube sections and spurs that aren't road accessible. Then dock it to the roof of the casino and let it windsock up there when otherwise not in use. Make it modular so it can either hold cargo or a human transport and entertainment module, so it can do air to ground laser shows, flying rock concert so anyplace is a theater."
"Are they using the latest iteration in the superchargers yet?

If they still use 12 they could theoretically increase the effect shared between two chargers from ~140KW to ~210KW which would help hugely at crowded supercharger stations (granted they also got bigger inlet cables and transformers of course)."
Screw it. Tesla should just start making rockets. I heard the private rocket industry is really taking off these days.
We tried everyone.
A 600 amp service is big but not crazy. It's of course right in line with the electric semi charges that are going in. The charger will cost more than the service in most cases anyway. 
"Is a aluminum chasis even a possibility?  I don't know anything about how Semi's are constructed.  I assumed ICE ones were steel for strength, ease of use, and cost. But as you mentioned, Tesla needs to cut pounds every chance they get.  Cost concerns aside, could you build a sufficiently strong semi frame from light weight aluminum?"
Pretty much I'm saying that you're a moron if you think electric cars can't be sustained
"Oh Jesus Christ, I forgot to square c lol. And I missed the hour part of your units, this is what I get for redditing on alcohol."
"I just blanked, /u/Shrike99 was using MWh, so thats the number I should have used. He also didn‚Äôt forget to square c and got what is likely the right number"
"The answer I got was 0.00016 grams, FYI"
"Ah, that's true. But now that a relatively large segment of automakers agree that going with cameras is better, there's considerable support, it still might take years though. For the Semi at least the mirrors blend in, it might prove to be a challenge to integrate in the 2020 Roadster without harming it's visual appeal from the concept."
All is lost.
"The Freightliner Cascadia has an Al frame option but details are scant.
https://freightliner.com/trucks/cascadia/specifications/

Generally you'd steer clear of aluminum for fatigue life reasons coupled with the fantastic strength to weight ratios for modern steel used in frames.

For ultra lightweight Magna went steel in 2013

Technically correct. The best kind of correct.

"Yeah, but the effect of the multi color tint on my Model 3 is particularly striking.  It looks like the above photo and it's pretty enough that whenever I see it, I stop and stare for a minute."
but let us all jerk off onto this guy's rooftop glass first
That's some gorgeous color. 
"Looks like it has a [Cut-E](http://glassed.vitroglazings.com/glasstopics/how_lowe_works.aspx) coating.  
  
The water droplets cause the reflected infrared to cross into the visible spectrum by slowing down the light and effectively shortening the wavelengths ([refraction](https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/49-refraction-of-light)).  All the other light, that isn't reflected, simply passes through the glass.
  
Edit: further explanation"

"Is it always so iridescent?  My Subaru‚Äôs sunroof don‚Äôt look like that....

Still gorgeous nonetheless
probs because it's his pic
"I'll take a stab at this.

Basically, Tesla is putting a coating on their glass roofs that reflects UV and/or IR (probably both), but lets through visible light. This is called a [dielectric mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_mirror), or dichroic filter, or interference filter. It's made up of a number of thin, alternating layers of 2 materials with different refractive indices. You can tune the wavelengths that they reflect and transmit by changing the materials and thus their refractive indices as well as by changing the layer thicknesses.

Normally, you can't really tell that there is a coating on the glass, as it is reflecting UV and IR, which you can't see, so it just looks like normal glass. However, when water (or some other liquid) is sitting on the surface of the glass, water has a different refractive index than air so it changes the optical properties of the coating and will then start to reflect different wavelengths.

If I remember correctly, water should shift it to higher wavelengths, and thus a coating that was reflecting UV will now be reflecting in the visible (could have this backwards though - might be shifting to shorter wavelengths). In addition, dielectric mirrors have an angle dependence to them, so you will see different colors at different angles and thus the rainbow type effect. This is the same principle that makes those color shift pigments/paints work that you sometimes see on cars, printed on currency, etc.

Hope this makes sense, let me know if I can clarify anything."
Because silver looks good with orange/red?
This makes me wish there was a Chrome Orange option.
[deleted]
"The Model S has the same glass and has no big history of chips over the past 6 years.  That one also broke the rollover crash test machine when they tried to crush it, so you can put that worry to bed, it's strong enough to avoid chips at a minimum."
Go get some Weatherbeaters. 
It's called being subscribed. 
"LOL. Not quite the one I had in mind.

Yup!
"It is when it's wet.  When it's not wet, then it's sort of a dark gray/green color but once it's wet it turns an orangish/red that looks exactly like these photos."
"no only with certain lighting (low angle, normally dawn/dusk) and more so when wet, it's a result of the tint on the glass"
"It's shifting longer wavelengths, the shorter the wavelength the less energy it has. The droplets slow down some of the reflected infrared, (longer wavelength) taking some of the energy, which causes the once infrared to enter the visible red spectrum.

My concern is AZ. It seems like every week a landscaping truck dumps gravel. Everywhere.

"I ordered dogpoop hamburgers and they TASTE LIKE SHIT!  
I'm appalled the shit I ordered tastes like shit!  
Who do I sue?"
it was a great 2000s
"It hasn't been a problem for me on either car in the Tempe area.  I had a chip filled on the 85 windscreen a while back, but that was on the highway.  I can't even begin to imagine how landscaping trucks would be able to dump gravel on more than one person's roof before they get arrested which is probably why it's never happened.   Roof damage is no more common on a Tesla than on any other car."
"Yeah, quite the yesterday"
"Yes, but most other roofs aren't glass..  Considering how often windshields are damaged,  a glass roof brings me. Some concern."
"Well, anxiety is something you have to tackle on your own, irrational fears aren't easy to get past and logical reason doesn't help.  But if you simply weren't aware, it's just windshield glass on the roof, roofs don't get damaged often for any reason, and hundreds of thousand Tesla owners, as well as millions of Mercedes owners and decades of driving can help you push past the concern.  Tesla didn't invent the glass roof, it's gotten pretty common from a lot of manufacturers so there's absolutely no rational need to worry about it."
Anywhere else in the US I would be fine. but the SW seems to be nothing but rocks and gravel on the freeways.  Its surreal. 
"Check your roof for dents, objects falling on your roof hard enough to break glass will also dent the thin steel of your roof, and definitely chip the paint so you can easily see if you have a justified anxiety.  

Also, call your local mercedes, bmw, vw, porsche, and audi dealerships to see how bad often their cars are serviced with this imagined problem, they'd be able to tell you with a lot more more experience than Tesla.  

I can tell you from 7 years and multiple Teslas experience in your back yard that hundreds of thousands of miles have resulted in no chips, and hundreds of thousands of mercedes miles have none of the same, and a little bit less of Porsche targa all glass roof driving still no chips, maybe a million miles of steel roof driving has resulted in no paint chips on the roof either, and it's easier to chip paint than it is to break safety glass.

We don't have a lot of planes dropping things onto cars here in the SW, I know it's anxiety and it's not logical, but the best I can do is try to help you reason it away yourself."
"What's your project time to break even with the Tesla?

I'm assuming you made the call base on running the math, not just emotion."
I want to be at the level of success where I can just buy a Tesla when my car breaks... 
How much is the Semi?
Is the 253 simply an incremental number?
I heard people complain Elon didn‚Äôt release the weight of the truck mentioning only it can haul 80 tons. He didn‚Äôt separate cargo from cab weight in that figure. Are you concerned by that or is that not a real concern? 
"My dad is always having problems with his Freightliner, though usually surrounding the sleeper cab conversion. I really wish the Semi would be available sooner, that's probably the only thing keeping my dad from getting one. Price is competitive. He just doesn't know if he'll still be driving by the time he can get it."
"I havent done any extensive research on the semi but I did see the 2 models, one for 300miles and one for 500miles, how quickly do they charge?"

What feedback have you gotten from Tesla regarding your application?  Sorry to read about your truck.  
"I thought ""tesla semi reservation"" meant you were partially reserved for something, but then I read the title."
How much do you think Tesla breakdowns are gonna cost you?
cant wait until you get yours and tell us all how it works out. plus seeing those mods you have in mind. :D
Is this for the reservation you made shortly after the unveiling? It must be because the deposit went up soon after. I would have thought your reservation number would be much lower.

But you are getting one for use in that area?
U think a $12k breakdown is bad on that diesel wait til something breaks on that Tesla whoo-wee! also the backlog on parts for repair. 
Did you factor in the repairs time if someone crashes into you or that the initial trucks will have lots of problems? You may want to keep a backup truck until they resolve all those issues.  
WTF DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING????

Serious Question. Has there been any data released detailing Tesla vehicles in sub zero temperatures?  It's my understanding that they use lithium polymer batteries which have pretty significant capacity reduction at temperatures as high as 0¬∞ let alone at temperatures significantly before that.  Basically any lithium based battery has very poor performance in low temperature settings as the electro-chemistry reactions literally halt at those temperatures.  I work on high altitude and exo-atmospheric electrical designs and we still use some nickel cadmium and thermal batteries for exactly this reason.  I'm a huge Tesla fan but would worry that the design would not work well in very low temperature due to physics.
"Absolutely mental you people are willing to give money to Tesla like this when they've already proven they cannot deliver preorders. (Model 3) But whatever, it's your money. "

"Teslas aren't very reliable, FYI

Truck should pay for itself in 10-12 months.
"Well it‚Äôs actually cheaper to buy a Tesla.

Soon you‚Äôll be saying you want to be at the level of success where you can afford to not buy a Tesla haha"
"The level of success would be the equivalent of moving into a Model 3 for someone who runs a Taxi company or works as a driver for Uber/Lyft. 

The Semi Truck, along with maintenance and fuel is a business cost.

Semi trucks have a pretty high duty factor compared with commuter cars. The Tesla Semi should have a vastly lower operational cost for fuel and maintenance compared to the traditional diesel one.

The high duty cycle lets you make the most out of the lower fuel and maintenance costs, making it so theoretically the ROI should be under 2 (1 maybe!) years for adding a semi to the fleet with an electric drive-train rather than diesel."

"$200,000CAN roughly"
I think so
With EO for Elon's Order?
No I‚Äôm not concerned.  It turns out the weight is about the same as an ice truck
Are you sure about that 80 ton figure? Standard semis are limited to 80k lbs (40 Tons). 
"Elon actually said that the Semi is a Class 8 truck. That means that the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of the truck is 80,000 lb. That means that the weight of the Semi plus its trailer(s) plus the cargo cannot exceed 80,000 lb without special permitting. Assuming that the Semi weighs what a diesel powered tractor weighs and it's pulling a standard 53 ft long trailer, then the maximum cargo weight is around 47,000 lb."
"Do you mean still be driving in the sense that autopilot will be done by then? That‚Äôs an interesting point. The semi is a long way out, and supposedly auto drive is coming reasonably soon. Clearly the truck will be here before autonomous driving, but by how long?

If the semi is finally available in 2-3 years, then autonomous driving becomes popular in 5-10 years, that could mean the Tesla Semis only ever actually get driven for a very few years before the entire occupation for truck drivers is gone. "
"The truck is capable of being charged to a range of like 400 miles in 30 minutes using the new Megachargers.

And give it 2 mores years when we will start seeing the semi in hands of customers we can probably think that tesla will double or triple the amount of Service centers because way more model 3s will be coming, and the model Y. "
Probably Gigafactory 1. Fremont is reportedly too busy with Model 3 and there are no other buildings being able to produce the Semi

I can‚Äôt see that many more initial problems than a normal truck

It‚Äôs also just adding not replacing any trucks"

Edit: and it‚Äôs fully refundable too"
Cannot deliver? What's with the 10k Model 3s driving around?
That‚Äôs not going to happen for a very very long time.  
What the worst problem will be? Uneven gaps between the panels? ;)
"However not their motors.

It‚Äôs all the rest of the car that has issues.

And the Tesla Semi shares proven parts from other conventional trucks to help mitigate this issue.

You‚Äôll find the same parts on my Kenworth as on the Tesla"
"With that logic, your $12k breakdown would only take ~2 weeks to break even. Doesn‚Äôt sound that bad. "
Here I am fantasizing about just driving a Semi to and from my office. In that scenario I suppose it‚Äôll take more than 10-12 months to pay for itself.
Can you explain how you arrive at that?  I‚Äôm interested. 
Not bad at all ! Did you include any type of infrastructure you need to charge the truck? Or perhaps you don't need it?
"Wtf, I should be a truck driver."
How did you pay the wire transfer? Me and a couple buddies want to establish a transport company based around sustainability but that wire transfer is a killer as it requires us to seek outside funding.
Oh god I hope so!

Modern diesels are also more prone to having issues than they used to be at much earlier mileage. Their systems are markedly more complex than the million mile+ behemoths of old.
"I don't know anything about Teslas, but why would the maintenance cost be lower? Seems like the opposite would be true - fewer people that know how to fix them, and less common parts. "

Best of luck on disrupting the trucking industry! Great to see entrepreneurs taking risks to reap greater rewards by embracing cutting edge tech!
What is the exact weight?
So like what is keeping me from just buying this instead of a car? Of course regular diesel semis have terrible gas mileage but if I want a moving sleeper cab I wonder why wouldn't I just buy this electric semi if gasoline is no longer the issue? Does it cost significantly more to charge it up?
Does megacharger infrastructure worry you?
That‚Äôs amazing! You‚Äôd think because of the batteries that it would weigh tons more but they must have some sort of magic going on. Good on Tesla. Be sure to let us know how it is when you get it. 
Nah. That breaks the physicists. 
Not in Canada. 88k gross on a standard tandem trailer. 140k gross for the heavy haulers. Op is based in Canada. He has a few other trucks for the heavy haul/specialty moves. I assume the tesla would be for the more regular freight moves.
Could be I‚Äôm not to versed in that but I think you might be right. 
I believe he meant that his dad is retiring soon.
lol
"~~Where do you get more than 3 dollars a mile? what are you hauling? and that's your profit? damn you're good.~~
ok, I think I found you. IDK how much those special jobs are paying. Anyways, do you think a Tesla will work as fine as the truck you have now? "
"I suspect for your specific use, there needs to be some significant design changes made.  Hope it works out and you can get a truck very soon.  Suggest to be a field test customer.  If you've participated other OEM field tests, you will get your hands on a truck much sooner. "
"They kinda know that in this day and age, any info given to one customer turns into worldwide news, so they're probably a bit wary, especially considering even the production plant is not defined (or at least not public info)"

"> Because a breakdown in a Tesla Semi may not cost $12000. It will also be covered by warranty for some time.


We have no idea what a breakdown on a Tesla Semi will cost. Out of warranty and repairs not covered by warranty can be stupidly expensive, since Tesla has a monopoly on parts and service. 

In the logistics world the cost of the repair is just a part of the cost of not being able to be on the road. Time is money and if your truck is just sitting there it means it's costing you money. With Tesla being Tesla repairs and spare parts leave a lot to be desired so how many weeks/months will these semis be sitting around waiting on parts and repair?   "
"Not to mention less to actually put a Tesla Semi out of commission.  

One Model 3 standard motor per rear wheel (4 total) and can lose 2 motors and still operate - by which I mean still function AND still outperform a diesel tractor.  Allows you to schedule when to pull it out for the motor swap, likely even something a Tesla Semi Ranger will be able to do while the thing is charging, or doing a delivery/pickup."
Pretty sure in their conference they said lifetime warranty 
That is one of the dumbest things I have ever heard. No offense.
"Oh okay! That makes sense. Sorry, got a bit worried! "
"Just to spare Daswooshie46 from googling:

https://www.youtube.com/user/bjornnyland

One of his recent videos was recorded in Northern Norway @ around -36¬∞C (so also close to -40¬∞F).  He slept in the car.  In the morning, his tires were stiff (and unround) and the battery wasn't capable of delivering (or receiving) much current -- but the car worked.  He just had to drive slowly for a while until things had warmed up a bit.

If the car had been plugged in, it could easily have kept the battery warm so the tires would have been the only problem.

Would you leave a semi tractor outside in the cold in such a place without plugging it in?"
So you're giving them an interest free loan? That's not a very smart financial move. And $5000 is a lot of money to most Americans.
"A laughably small percentage of the amount promised and the amount  targeted. [Currently the weekly production of Model 3s is below 1000.](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/) But yeah, everything's fine if you keep those fanboy blinders on."

Good luck fixing the Tesla semi when it breaks down. My S has been in the shop for 10 and they haven't diagnosed it yet.
Not if you live in the sleeper!
"Truck costs $200,000.

No I didn‚Äôt include that.  But that‚Äôs 1-2 months max

"I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being downvoted, you‚Äôre correct"
I was talking to a diesel mechanic not too long ago and he told me that with the new diesels there are 50+ new things that can break and if one of them does it will limit your truck to 35mph. So you can limp to a shop.
"Less of a complexity issue. More of an emmissions standard issue. Heavy diesels havent changed drastically from 20 years ago, but the push to reduce emmisions has put alot of gadgets on the engines that aren't reliable. EGR and DPF being the biggest garbage"
"Far fewer moving parts = less to go wrong, less parts to lubricate, less parts to replace proactively.
Eg:,regenerative braking instead of disks/drums etc means your pads last eons, and the disks is geological time frames..."
"Most of the maintenance is with the drive train. In general, electric drive trains require less maintenance than drive trains that use combustion. There are fewer moving parts and less extreme temperatures.

If you are talking about things like AC units and what not, you are right. It's cheaper to maintain a Civic than, say a Peugeot 208."
I‚Äôm just tired of breakdowns and pissed off more than anything haha
"I think they said around 22,000lbs"
Not really but I‚Äôm local
Diesel engines and transmissions weigh tons too
Wow. That‚Äôs some big weight!
Yeah it's 40 tons total weight. So how much of that can be cargo is still unknown.
"My one move two weeks ago paid $7000/mile gross.

"I‚Äôll talk to them.

I‚Äôve talked to my rig up guys and they said they can do all the changes aftermarket."

"At the very least, it's not going to be a mass produced vehicle like the model 3 at first.  They'll have a longer time / space to build up a reserve of parts a lot easier in theory.  Doesn't mean they will do that though."
"Motor specific breakdowns sure, but breakdowns on a semi also include, but not limited to, wheel seals, suspensions, air lines, etc etc. Many of these things can be repaired by your everyday roadside mechanic. "
">  Tesla has a monopoly on parts and service

That's only because the S and X are both incredibly low volume cars that the aftermarket isn't interested in because there's no profit. 

Once the 3 is being pumped out at hundreds of thousands of units a year, the aftermarket is going to spring right into action. LKQ will start re-manufacturing parts just like they do for most brands now. Other manufacturers will copy suspension and brake parts and you'll be able to get time at places like Autozone.

This aftermarket support will compete somewhat with Tesla so OEM parts prices should stay within reason (kind of like what Mercedes parts cost now). I've seen Model S brake calipers go for $1,000 each and that's highway robbery if it isn't a 6 pot Brembo. 

"
">	We have no idea what a breakdown on a Tesla Semi will cost. Out of warranty and repairs not covered by warranty can be stupidly expensive, since Tesla has a monopoly on parts and service.

Indeed. Repair costs can be astronomical. I‚Äôd have a very hard time owning a Tesla out of warranty, at least at this point. The total repair costs on my 2013 P85 have to be downright staggering. "
"I know we don't know the cost of repair. I was merely speculating based on less moving parts in the truck compared to a Gas powered one and things like the warranty that will at lease cover it for some period of time as mentioned in a reply to me.

The person I replied to assumed OP meant the Tesla will never break down at all and that is why he put the down payment on it when his Semi needed the $12k in repairs."
No. 1 Million Miles.
I was more joking about Elon suggesting that during the unveiling 
Sarcasm is lost on some people.
Trust me I‚Äôm not the first person to get excited about a Tesla order and post it online.  Haha
"Dude get a life. OP knows his financials better than you. Plus, if he doesn't invest 100% of his money having 5000 in his bank account or Tesla's bank account makes little difference."
"Sure, a production ramp is proof of an inability to deliver, I guess they will just go out of business next week if you want to keep those troll blinders on."
"Outdated CR statistic and ""big"" problems with small things like door handles... Nothing that really matters in a semi.

"
"WAY obsolete.

BTW my late 14 has been great.  Other than a few panel rattles which were easily fixed with isolator tape, and some outside noise fixed by Dynamat+Dynaliner, it's been almost perfect."

Won't it take a while for that kind of ubiquity to form for Tesla trucks?  How will you make due on the cutting edge before it shapes up?

Not being rhetorically by the way; I honestly am curious. "
"If you're making that much profit, I'm curious - why did it take today's repair to push you over the edge instead of reserving on day 1?"
[deleted]
"10 what? Minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months?"
How exactly did it break down?
"I'm kind of thinking the semi doesn't have a sleeper, which would be a shame.  It looks like there was some spare space there in the intro event, but they showed cabinets behind the driver, rather than a full sleeper compartment.  Since they say the focus is on medium haul rather than long haul, I'm thinking they're using that space for batteries or something and didn't want to put a sleeper in there."
"If I lived in my Semi and re-directed all my rent toward my car loan, it'd take me like 15 years to break even.

That said, I could buy one of those shipping container homes and drive to work in the semi. Wait, just how much range does that thing get without a trailer?!"
"You could do this with a Model S/X in camper mode, too :)"
"That's kind of my plan if I can transition into a cnc field technician. It could be the perfect platform if self driving becomes fully autonomous on highways, even if only outside of major cities. With a box on the back for living in, plus storage space for tools, it would make a fantastic mobile home and office."
"Okay, but shouldn't you calculate the delta in costs between making that profit with your current diesel truck (counting cost and downtime for repairs) vs. the Tesla Semi? Presumably, you are making $20-$25k per month with the diesel truck so the Tesla is just additional cost unless it is provably cheaper to operate.

And how are you going to charge it?"
So did they give you an indication of the costs of installing/running a megacharger?
"This sub is among the bunch that think full auto-pilot semis will be putting truckers out of work within 5 years lol, they don‚Äôt like when people get a little more realistic"
I can tell you from firsthand experience this is very true. My damn Hino was in the shop once a week minimum at 300k miles. So glad I don't drive for a living anymore.
That‚Äôs why emissions deletes are so common
"This is how Tesla takes over the world!

""Do you like being inconvenienced? Fuck no! Buy Tesla!"""
I‚Äôm kind of confused by this logic. What makes you think the Tesla will break down any less? Wear and tear is still wear and tear. Newer tech + higher price point = higher repair costs once any warranty is gone. 
I'm sure plenty of others are too!
"Tired of breakdowns, but orders a Tesla, [one of the car manufacturers with most break downs and problems?](https://www.whatcar.com/news/reliability-survey/)"
Hopefully your semi will be more reliable than my new model s (air suspension quit because of water in the system and left me stuck in the snow).
Where will you charge in an ice road? Is capacity enough to get there and back or can your destination install a charger? 
That's pretty good. Pretty close to a lot of trucks when topped off. How heavy are your empty trailers on average?
For what range?
"To you directly? I've never seen numbers for this

E: thanks for all the insight you bring to these discussions! "
10 Ton? Could be some rounding in there...
"Not to mention the large volume of fluids required compared to the Tesla just needing a glycol coolant.  ICE needs ATF, Diesel, coolant, and motor oil."
Not nearly as much as a 1MWh battery.
"Yeah I‚Äôve hauled loads up to 255,000lbs here"
"According to OP's recent 22k lbs statement, that leaves 58k lbs for cargo. "
"The real question is......
What kind of bumper are you going with?
Full on cow catcher or just a bush bar?"
Best of luck!
So lots of delays expected? 
"I wonder how long it would take the average long-range trucker to eat through that?

Edit: this is why I love reddit."
"Plus if I keep the $5000 it‚Äôs taxed at 30%

If I reserve a Tesla it‚Äôs considered growth and not taxed.  This is a write off that I could get back if it doesn‚Äôt work."
"Yes being unable to deliver is proof they cannot deliver...what more proof that they cannot deliver could you ask for beyond them actually not delivering? It's not only an issue with the Model 3 they've proven they can't supply parts too.  Want me to pull up stories about Model S and X owners waiting in excess of six months to get new parts or their cars fixed? 

Are you denying you're a fanboy there Mr. tesla123456? I never said they're going out of business I just said they've proven they're unable to deliver on their promises and giving them money after this track record is asinine. Not even Apple fanboys are this blinded by Apple products. "
Some truckers make bank. The tradeoff is that you don't have much time for family as you're on the road your whole life.
$270k per 1 truck in a year
"I looked at his profile, this guy hauls material for the oil industry in Canada. Makes perfect sense now."
"Probably take longer to get work done on the Tesla specific components but most of the truck is made using standard trucking industry parts.

All trucks use the same parts.

Parts on my 1969 are the same as my 2006"
"This is one question I have had about the Semi.  In the US, truck and car service centers are separate.  This is based on practical considerations.  Wonder if Tesla is planning on building out a semi sales and repair infrastructure."
Oh I reserved this on day 1.  I‚Äôm just saying I can‚Äôt wait to get it
"The part was $3,500.  Labour was $9500.

">The state wide power-outages of 2025 and 2030 are going to spell empty grocery store shelves across the state. Because the food trucks can't deliver.

The largest power outages in US history were in 1965 and 2003, covered a half dozen states, and lasted 13 hours and 48 hours respectively. Where are you getting this fantasy outage lasting *weeks* where everyone is apparently just sitting around waiting to starve to death? "
"It all depends on what it is. 12k may not be that ridiculous based on labor and part costs.

Remember if you're stuck on the side of the road you need $250k tow truck and a high skill operator. A normal flat bed for a car is ~ $60-70k. Then you're paying for emergency mechanic services and parts shipped ASAP. 

I bet his truck will be back on the road in a day or two max.  "
"Just a transmission (mine's an Allison b500) can run over 10k installed. That's only a transmission, no engine. Although I'm sure manual trans is probably cheaper. And a rebuild on a Detroit diesel series 60 is between 8 and 15k depending on if you put reman or original Detroit brand parts. "
Might want to chill on the propaganda and learn something about working on vehicles.
If you still have major power outages as a country by 25/30 then you deserve them.
Haha stupidest shit I've ever read.
Uh... I guess you don't realize that the pump which pumps diesel into the trucks is electric.
"Ive got some real world experience here, ive had some trucks have some pretty expensive failures in only 5 years on the job. The first sticker shock came with a turbo the size of a basketball going bad, $5000. We got lucky and it didn't grenade, that would have required possibly another $5000 worth of labor to dismantle, clean, inspect and reassemble the 12 feet of intake and intercooler piping. 5 hours of labor at $60/hr. im a private fleet mechanic and super cheap, most shops are around $150/hr. 

A little background for the next one, the fleet hauls freight at 100,000 pounds, that needs horsepower, a lot of it. 425hp and 1526lb/ft of torque going through 2 axles, that's a ton of force. A rear end carrier decides to turn into glitter flakes and needed replacement. The 800lb, $6400 ""differential"" takes 6 hours of labor to replace, including cleaning, checking the housing for and repairing damage, setting and adjusting bearings and outright fighting with it to get it to fit without crushing your own skull. Theres only enough room for one person to work on the job and working as fast as i can to turn a profit, repairs are still very expensive and time consuming. 

 Even general maintenance is costly, 10 or more gallons of oil in an engine, 12 gallons of coolant, 5 gallons of transmission oil ($185), 7 gallons of gear oil per rear end ($165 each) a new DPF filter element is $3k of high temp ceramic in stainless steel, the list goes on. "

So on the high end thats 156k miles per year. So 6-7 years if they're maxing out the drives. If we use the lower end then it's closer to 10 years"
Drivers can do about 160k miles a year if they do long haul. Atleast a couple of years of warranty 
"The average long range trucker may take a while. Team drivers where they drop off a trailer, pick one up and change drivers to keep the tractor moving will get there much sooner.

I worked for a bakery in Oakland many decades ago. They loaded a set of doubles in Oakland, dropped one trailer in Reno, picked up an empty, changed drivers. Without shutting off the tractor went on to Fresno, dropped the second trailer with product, picked up a second empty, changed drivers. Again without shutting down they headed back to Oakland where we had half an hour for tractor maintenance while they loaded both trailers. About 250,000 Mi per year. Maintenance was regularly 400,000 Mi per motor; 800,000 transmission; 1.6M Mi rear end."

Will you immediately be able to take all the same jobs you currently are? "
"Adding to u/SEILogistics, you could cludge a fix together, but modern ICE engines are fine tuned for maximum efficiency. Big truck diesels are highly efficient for a diesel cycle. Heavy diesel mechanics require years of training, some are 4 year degrees. That makes their time worth over $100/hr cost to the customer, possibly up to/over $200/hr.

"I suspect a 240v charger will take more than eight hours to charge a 1MW battery. I get 40amp or nearly 10KW out of my 240v charger so that would take 80 hours to charge 80%.

Let's say you bump that to a massive 200amp feed just for the truck (FYI, I was quoted around $10k minimum to upgrade my household service feed to 400amp so I could charge two Tesla cars at the same time.). You get 160amp usable off that feed or 38.4KW. At that rate, you will need 20 hours to push 80% capacity into that 1MW battery.

I won't be surprised if infrastructure chargers are bigger and cost $20k - $40k to install."

"If this guy is really an ice road trucker, probably more like 2000 miles. It's about 1100 miles just from Yellowknife to Calgary.

"Any semi, Tesla or ICE will have to haul the same trailer which will add to the tare weigh, so yea...

22k is towards the high side, but still within specs for a diesel tractor though.  You also have to factor in the FULL weight of the tractor at max fluids, since you don't want to hit the scales after fueling up and be overweight.  At 7.5lbs/gal of typical diesel, and dual 150gal side tanks, that adds another ~2,200lbs to the tare of the tractor."

The point was that in your (ridiculous) scenario diesel trucks can't be filled because there is no electricity for the gas pump either... not that you'd use generators to charge electric trucks.
You forgot solar options for the roofs of the buildings they're running to/from. Or a big wind turbine.
"Well they might not be able to supply full power, but some PVs or a diesel generator would be able to provide some limited truck services that could be rationed. However, the larger solution is to just have trucks refuel in other areas. The Tesla trucks have a range of 300 miles, with the long range ones going 500. This is enough to charge outside an area without power, bring goods in, and leave before running out of charge."

There will 100% be a complete failure. No vehicle has a perfect history and that's especially true with new models."
"Hah! This is super cool, so they took advantage of how small and inexpensive an electric motor is? Or?"
"Yes, which is why they built in the ""Thermonuclear resistant windshield"" and have 4 motors, one per rear wheel.  A Tractor with a cracked windshield is not allowed to drive - having one thick and very resilient lowers this issue to near zero.  Having up to 50% motor failure and still being able to operate the semi while outperforming a diesel is likewise a difference between consumer and commercial."

Might also have a commercial battery recycling program to reduce this further. Actually it would be stupid of them not to considering these semis will aim to be on the road for a long long time."
"Jeff Dahn might have fixed yet.  Or if he hasn't yet, he might have before the Tesla semis are in production.

"I‚Äôm not the dude you asked, but I‚Äôll chime in. I work as a mechanic for one of the largest fleets in the US( not swift). Once you apply and land an interview, which you will, they‚Äôll hire you on and send you to an in house training program. The program only helps you obtain your Class A, so I can‚Äôt speak for Hazmat or Doubles etc. The course itself is about 6 weeks, no cost if you pass and depending on where you‚Äôll be trained, an employee of the company acts as a third party licenser. 

From there you‚Äôll go out with a trainer, they try to pair you to your same demographic(mid 20s male, non smoker, college grad or not etc) because you‚Äôll be with this person nearly 24 hours a day for the foreseeable future. With the trainer, you‚Äôll split drive time and they‚Äôll teach you the ins and outs of it all. Learning to back in to tight alleyways, dealing with asshole drivers and random DOT inspections by the local authorities. 

Once the trainer has full faith and confidence that you‚Äôre not a liability on the road, they‚Äôll let the fleet manager know and you‚Äôll be off on your own. The cool thing about my company is that we sell trucks at only 350k miles to keep our maintenance costs low, so the fleet is constantly replenished with new models. These new models are mostly automatic but some still come stick and the beauty of it is that even as a new driver they‚Äôll take your wishes into consideration. If you want a specific colored automatic Kenworth with a factory inverter to run a mini fridge, they‚Äôll do their damndest to get you that. 

In the US, and I may be slightly off on the numbers, you‚Äôre only allowed to work 14 hours a day with 11 being drive time. The other 3 may be for unloading trailers or idle time waiting on dispatch. You have a mandatory 34 hour rest every couple days which you‚Äôll take wherever you‚Äôre at, home or not. Then for ever 10 days on the road it‚Äôs 2 days home time, though that may be company specific. 

As for pay, it differs by company...obviously. The newest solo drivers in my company average 1500/week on dedicated accounts and a little bit less doing over the road. Doing OTR, you have to really plan your loads and hustle or you‚Äôll lose out on home time or money or both. 

OTOH my step dad drives local for a grocery chain, has been for 30 years. He‚Äôs home every night, weekends off and makes well into the six figures. Those kind of jobs require a minimum 5 years experience in all the elements though. 

It‚Äôs a good living, I never went hungry growing up and after dealing with drivers every day it‚Äôs readily apparent they don‚Äôt either. You just have to be content with not being at home. 

Long winded I know, but i thought I‚Äôd try to answer as well as I could.

"I genuinely disagree. I think we might be 20-30 years from all driving being automated, but that‚Äôs not the bar for ‚Äúbig impact‚Äù. 

I think we‚Äôre less than a decade from a large portion of highway semi truck driving being automated. This kind of driving is the easiest to automate, represents a large amount of the miles driven, and has some serious economic benefits for the trucking companies and their customers. Even 20% of semi truck driving being automated changes the game massively. "

"A generator could pump gas if you had one... good luck getting that during a power outage. And after pumping out the reservoir how are you going to get more gas when the refinery can't run? You didn't think this through at all.

Idk what you are talking about in the second paragraph, but solar panels are the obvious solution, not underground batteries... batteries don't produce power only store it."
"Would never generate enough power to be worth it. They need to point at the sun to work the best, not just straight up into the sky"
"> It's a real pickle, and Musk doesn't have a plan to address it.

It seems though Tesla is actually addressing the problem, which is state wide power outages, ie. Australia ;), even if not your particular scenario!"
"Tesla semi will have a battery on the order of 1 MWh. A modern wind turbine is rated around 5 MW, so if it's windy, it could fully charge 5 trucks per hour. The equivalent area of solar panels is about 35,000 square meters, whereas a typical warehouse is maybe 5000 square meters. If a truck arrives at 30% and takes an hour to unload, the warehouse could have it topped off before it leaves.

And then of course there are batteries. It's a lot of infrastructure that doesn't exist yet, but it's certainly feasible."
"One of the smart solutions I mentioned below is a Solar Farm Megacharger, it can island during grid outages and continue to charge trucks even if the grid is down for days or weeks.

However if the grid is down for weeks and there is no sun light we are screwed, probably in more ways than one.
"
"The biggest turbines currently available are 9.5MW from Vestas. So, get two.

Or get 5, 3MW turbines. Those are extremely common. 5 would be a really small field though. 

If you have good wind resources, might as well put in a couple dozen and power the town too. The existing diesel generators can be used for backup, slashing fuel costs enough to pay back the install costs with money to spare."

They actually keep themselves warm. 
That's the biggest concern - nothing like getting stuck in the middle of nowhere with a dead truck
"The larger the battery, the less surface area it has compared to volume, and therefore the less % of your battery energy you need to use to keep it warm."
Li-ion will shut down at low temps so they must heat themselves before they drop too low. If you're driving they should stay warm enough from discharge but if you're parked you will probably loose a lot of charge from the battery keeping itself warm (unless it's charging while you're parked).
"I think Batteries work better in the cold.

Also the trucks themselves should be as heavy as a fully fueled Diesel truck, if not heavier. And this is all the time heavy, not lighter as you burn fuel. "
"True... True.  But I think once the dam breaks, there will be no going back. Won't be too long before trucks like Tesla's will be the rule, not the exception. "

If it's an emergency, a Tesla semi can power the average home for 40 days on a full battery, so even a stopped single digit % truck waiting for rescue still has days or weeks of power if it's only powering the lights and heater.

Even a p100d can power a house for a week or so, driving at speed - especially with 80000 pounds - takes way more energy than staying warm."
"And not even ""stuck until someone gives me some fuel"" stuck.

"~~There's no way for it to actually have infinite range~~ (Perhaps if you added many times the truck weight in load, then unloaded when you're done going downhill) , as there are no 100% efficient regenerative brake systems, and no 100% efficient electric engines (though they are pretty close to 100%).

[Here's a video on a Tesla by mkbhd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O5PhuW927w&t=1s), he shows the Wh/mi indicator going uphill and downhill, and he averages around 700 Wh/mi going uphill, while -130 Wh/mi downhill.

"You could always unhook the load and leave it at the side of the road, and then even a few % of battery should be enough to get you to civilization."
"Is that 30% deficiency due to the cabin heater, or is it truly a cold-weather battery issue? "
[deleted]
"My 2012 MKZ Hybrid does it, very common. "
"Fun fact: this doesn't actually work with most DC motors, because the way they are wired does not allow for it. For instance, brushed DC motors use commutators which effectively robs you of the ability to use them in reverse. 

Tesla's actually use AC motors, specifically AC induction motors. Though you could use DC brushless for the same effect, those have a lower possible torque as they are limited by using permanent magnets. "
"I don‚Äôt even use cabin heat and still lose 25% range in my chevy volt. There‚Äôs also a computer setting where the engine is required to run below 15F. The problem is two fold: batteries are most efficient within a certain temperature range, and it requires energy to keep the car‚Äôs systems within the optimal range. It‚Äôs possible for a battery to be sold cold that its effectively dead until warmed.

http://gm-volt.com/forum/showthread.php?6695-Why-battery-performance-degrades-in-cold-weather-Chemistry-101#/topics/6695"
"Both.  The Tesla app will now show you the ""lost"" percentage of a frozen battery as a blue line on the battery bar. "
"It's truly a cold weather effect. Cold temperatures are both good and bad for batteries: they mean that the batteries will take far longer to drain on their own (self discharging), however they also are far less efficient at actually turning the chemical reaction into electricity. 

Lithium batteries are also notoriously sensitive. You can't charge them if they're below freezing temperature, as it will permanently damage them by plating lithium metal onto the anode. "
"Even so, I don't think (We don't have accurate data to work with yet, but still) it'll happen, as the Tesla semi has an alleged max load of 80000 lb or 36 t and I think it's weight would likely be around 20000 lb.

Honestly I wouldn't hold my breath for this semi, but we might see it in the future."
"I thought that the very nature of the function of an electric motor allowed for it. 

TIL"
How do they regenerate VARs? Can you actually create VARs off an inverter?
"U.S. Federal maximum for Gross Vehicle Weight is 80,000lb and set by the Department of Transportation. Therefore it's a useful figure for calculating the utility of a class 8 semi. That's all to say that it's not necessarily a Tesla maximum it's a federal law."
"You are right that an electric motor really wants to also be a generator. But often, the ways that we wire them up (to be cheap and easy to use) inherently prevent us from actually harvesting that energy. "
"I'm not sure I know what you're talking about. Are you talking about Volts-Amps Reactive?

If so, that's not totally an electric motor thing. Rather, it's how a power distribution system deals with inductive loads. In a way, the VAR load doesn't really exist, rather it's a measurement of how effectively power is being transmitted from the source to the load. 

The less VAR the better, because in a way you are measuring inefficiency. That is why you can improve how efficient your device is by actually adding capacitors, because though they technically consume power, they allow the power to flow optimally, which improves the overall efficiency. 

If you were talking about back-EMF, that is something that all electric motors deal with, and it's what causes VAR on a power grid. Back-EMF can be sometimes harvested, depending on the motor style, but sometimes the only thing is does is limit how fast the load runs or create a noisy power signal. 

""Universal Motors"" are an example of that. They rectify the power to DC when it enters, and that step is not really practically reversible. Thus the power can not be harvested. 

On the other hand, a synchronous AC induction motor (such as a fan you'd plug into the wall), could theoretically feed power back into the grid. If it is spun slightly faster than its design speed, rather than taking energy from the grid, the grid will be absorbing energy from it. For instance if it is running in a window and a breeze blows extra air through it. 

That is the model by which Tesla's regenerative braking works, since their motor is also an AC induction motor. Early electric cars used a brushed DC motor, similar to the Universal Motor, and had no way of absorbing the back-EMF and thus no way of regenerating that energy. 

Sorry for the long post. There's way more information in this than I can figure out how to write. "
"""Violators will be towed"" is usually effective. 

That aside, thats a really cool charging station. "
Minnesota has a new bill making it a tickatable offense to park at ANY electric car charging spot without charging.
"If Tesla really wants to protect those spots, they just have to have little parking bars that move out of the way when a unparked tesla is detected nearby/the owner pushes a button, and then block the space when theres no tesla there. 

They could also put a camera there and if there are 5 cars detected but only 4 Teslas register, automatically call the tow truck."
"Tesla should set up car spray painting booths. Park at one and get a free design spray painted on your car. If you didn't want a cool design, you could turn off the feature by plugging in the supercharger. "
"No signage will stop people. Look how many handicap tickets get written, and they‚Äôre really expensive in most places. Dicks will always be dicks. 


The only thing that physically would stop people from doing it is some kind of barrier that can only be moved from a Tesla‚Äôs touchscreen or something like that. Lot of logistical problems with that though. "
Teslas have plenty of torque. You just need a winch and a hook.
"I know it's not the right thing, but it makes me want to see EV's using gas pumps as personal parking like ""Uh, is this not a reasonable place to park?"""
"By the time I had to sell mine I had mostly stopped using public charging because that shit happened so often.  Fortunately for me I had charging at home and if I was heading somewhere distant, one of the nearby superchargers is in a pretty inconvenient spot.

I think one of two things needs to happen and neither is cheap:  run lines to the far sides of parking lots so chargers aren't also the best parking spots and/or make many/most spots into chargers."
"Get some business cards printed up that explain the issue and leave them on every vehicle you see blocking a supercharger.  Something like this, although maybe less aggressive:  https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0837/1249/products/yousuckatparking_1024x1024.JPG?v=1480115588"
Longer cables or better positioned chargers so you can double-park them.
"It's almost always luxury car owners. They most likely saw the sign and are just arrogant, entitled assholes who think things like that don't apply to them. In their mind, they deserve to use the closer parking spots."

"I may be a douche, but I‚Äôd park behind them granted you had ample room for other cars to pass by. If they cause trouble, say your charge ran out, or is close to running out and they are blocking the only way to charge it. I figure they know they are already in the wrong, but actually having to see they are in the wrong and it affects people rather than an empty parking space. "
"I would just park my car across the three of them with my cell number in the window. They can call me when they're done

"property manager in Canada here; we make all users register before they can charge. They enter a code associated with their name and credit card. If the vehicle lingers longer than two (2) hours, we charge them $70 an hour to park there.

People don't often make that mistake twice."
They could put a post there that only lowers when a Tesla is detected to be approaching. 
"Tesla doesn't own the property. The property owners have to be the ones to enforce the spots. My local Level 3 charger has all sorts of signs saying that the spaces are for EV charging only and others will be towed away, but when I called about an ICE blocking the charger I needed to use, they admitted that they have no authority to actually tow anybody away who's ICEing the spots. I would have to contact the merchant who owns the lot and see if they would be willing to have the car towed. Of course they aren't interested in pissing off a customer so nothing happens. "

"Make longer charging cables, so you can just block them in and still charge with the long cable."
Maybe they need to install bollards on supercharger spaces that lower automatically for a Tesla but won't let anything else in.
[deleted]
"The answer people don't like, make them less desirable spots. If they are near the top/far from the entrance people will take them less, while people charging will be willing to walk more."
"How about a windshield sticker that says ""Don't be an ICEhole"" - preferably one that takes a bit of work to get off.  No permanent damage, but just enough of a hassle to make them consider not doing it again."
"Leave a note on the windshield that says 

""Sorry for the damage. Maybe next time don't park like a twat"".

Don't do anything to the car, of course. Just leave the note on the windshield."
This is an easy problem to solve.  We should all pass laws that say whomever is first to call in a violator to be towed gets half of the towing fee.  People will set up their own cellular-connected cameras to watchdog that shit just to make the money.
They need to be explicit. It says Tesla‚Äôs can charge there for 60 minutes.  It doesn‚Äôt say no one else can park there. 
Ticket them and use proceeds to get us closer to mars
"If the charger could detach automatically with a timer or something, retract itself, and then the car could have a feature where it just moves out of the way and parks in an adjacent parking spot, that would be perfect."
"Be expensive, but bollards that only lower for a Tesla would do the trick."
What does ICEing mean?
"I don‚Äôt think it would be massively difficult, so here is my solution:
Have bollards around those bays. Then have automatic plate recognition cameras around those bays - when a Tesla pulls up the camera can read the registration plate then send that off to the DVSA api and find out if the registration plate is registered to a Tesla car. If it is, then the automatic bollard will lower. 
Seems kinda extreme, but I‚Äôd make the software for free. I don‚Äôt even own a Tesla - It‚Äôs all about principle. "

I would think they could implement something like that. There could be an annoying alarm that would go off to discourage drivers to park there and to inform security to tow and or fine the vehicles. "
Extension cords and double park in front of them since they cant have you towed either. 
"Cameras linked to the DVLA database. If not Electric, fine harshly. If they can't fine that harshly, legislate. The UK government does it best. Everywhere else, tow."
Where was this photo taken?
"Tesla could install a barricade in front of the parking space that only drops down for Tesla vehicles, if money was not a factor."
"Ah, but rich people can park *anywhere*."
I always give ICERs a dirty look when I‚Äôm supercharging and they pull into the charging spot next to me. I hope the embarrassment will make them pick another spot.
Launch them into space.
Bet this is Westfield in London. Always like this. 
Maybe put a gate that will only open for a tesla car? 
[deleted]
Why not send a software update to teslas that will have an operating code so when the pump connects it only charges if the key is valid. And each Tesla can have a unique one so another car couldn‚Äôt program it in. 
"""Violators will be towed"""
"I have an idea. Tesla should Sell charger extension cables. When you see this happening, park behind the violator, blocking them in, and use the extension cable to plug in your car."
If the cords were longer I would block the person in and plug into the charger that way.
Make the charging cables long enough that you can double park them in and still charge.
"Put two-way wireless communication systems in the cars and superchargers. When a car is parked in the stall and doesn't respond to the communication handshake, photo and ticket the plate of the ICE. Perhaps play an audible warning."
Park in front of them
"This is Valet holding spots so they can get/force Tesla owners to pay them to charge in that location.

Lame, but I've seen it happen in busy parking lots that have chargers."
"Since it's for Tesla's only, just put electric Gates on them to only let Tesla's in."
Those are fucking cunts
Nothing a key can't fix.
"Mercedes and BMW, no surprise."
Rich people don't care about your stupid signs and regulations.  That's how they got rich.  Doing what serves themselves not what serves to community. 
They could put tolls in front of the chargers so only Tesla‚Äôs can park there. They could use the cars key or maybe the car will give a signal to the toll when their near.
"looks like the rich pricks are just jealous that they don't get special treatment in society anymore. there is a class above them now, the tesla drivers."
"Maybe they could build dedicated locations for charging at convenient locations- major intersections, freeway off ramps, etc- where electric car owners recharge their vehicles. Maybe they could add amenities so that while the vehicles recharge the owners could use the restroom, get snacks, make calls. 

I haven‚Äôt done a complete business plan, but it looks feasible. It also seems like segregating the facilities required for a minority of drivers would be better than demanding the majority cater to them and their niche transportation mode. "
Maybe needs a massive public drive to improve public reading skill.  ;)
"Pee on the driver side door handle, after coming in contact with it, the prey will fear the area later on."
This is Tesla we're talking about. They could create a bollard that only lowered for Tesla vehicles via Bluetooth or similar.
"A large, clear sign that designates the area for charge cars. That way drivers dont park, see the sign, and proceed to ignore it our of convenience."
"It may also be a good idea, since electric cars are still relatively new, having charge stations a designated, distinguishable color. It may not be an immediate fix, but as time goes on and it becomes common knowledge, it might show to be a very smart marketing practice. Having reserved parking for a car type, especially in large progressive cities? I'd buy an electric car just for that."
"Put on a joke ""Violators' vehicle will be violated."""
"People will take any loophole they can find.  If it doesn't explicitly say EV **ONLY** or state a penalty, it will be much less effective."
Folding bollards on every bay that automatically fold down when there's a supercharging unlocked car approaching.
All that has to be done is locate the charging stations far from the entrance. Only people who need to charge will park way out there. 
Tesla should put up retractable barriers that automatically retract when a Tesla approaches.
Pull in chargers so you can back in front of these selfish people and trap them while you charge.
Park behind
[deleted]
I thought I read a tweet somewhere that tesla starts charging your credit card every 5 minutes past the time your car is fully charged. 
"If this was happening near me I'd consider making some YouTube content documenting the stupid people like the ""Stop a douchebag"" channel, maybe even with similar big stickers. (If someone does this please let me know, I'd watch the shit out of that channel)"
"Simple gates that connect wirelessly ONLY to teslas.

edit: or maybe via app, as well."
They should make the cables long enough to reach further. Then just park in front blocking them in. I'm sure they won't want to get blocked in ever again lol

This problem really deserves more attention.  Thoughts and prayers.  Stay strong.
Electronic bollards that lower for Teslas
What's ICEing?
I don't see why a photo (like this) can't be used as evidence and a fine issued to the owner of the vehicle.  Post an obscene fine like $1000 and start enforcing. 
"I think an automated gate or bollard that only Tesla drivers can unlock would fix it. 

Something like this or bigger? 

https://www.advancedroadsigns.com.au/Automatic-Parking-LockParking-p/tm-pl.htm"
Perhaps they could set up some sort of simple barrier which only opens up with Tesla car keys or something like that
"""Call Button"" that sends a summoning text to the owner when charged "
Put a little NFC chip near the charger and in your key fob which unfolds a barrier allowing you to park there.
"Do extra long cables supercharging cables, just block the irresposibles with you Tesla until full charge."
Put a fence in front of them that only opens with a button inside the car
"Install pylons at the front and put sensors in the teslas that cause the pylons to lower into the ground when the tesla is in range? 

Or something more practical with the same effect."
This would be super easy to solve with bollards that retract when a Tesla gets there.  The car already knows if the spot is in use so just put an option on the screen to select a spot and unlock it. Boom bollard retracts. 
"I wonder if it is feasible to use overhead rail driven chargers. That way any parking spot along the row is potentially an EV charging spot, as long as 1 space is free."
"Too expensive and liability would be too high, but retractable tire spikes would be nice. "
"Why did I understand this as immigration police arresting illegal immigrants that are charging their Teslas, causing a bunch of abandoned electric cars at charging ports?"
Just block them in and charge up. I believe it's called [musking](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.urbandictionary.com/define.php%3fterm=musking&amp=true).
Make the cords longer so you can park behind them.
How about a really long charge cable and you just park behind them?
Park behind them and stretch the cord out. It will reach and they can get out on your schedule
Just work up some good flem spit and spit it right on the drivers door handle.
"Finally, our enhance prayers have been answered."
I drive a Bolt and get iced all the time. I think the problem is that the e-spots are always way up front in the best spots. I wish they‚Äôd put the spots way out so they wouldn‚Äôt be so tempting. 
Just make the cables so long that you can park in front of the ICE car and still charge. Added bonus: you end up blocking them in. 
A bollard or a tire damage device at the front of each spot that lowers or disables only when a Tesla is about to pull in. 
"This place is clearly for charging your Tesla, why the fuck would so many people park in these spaces"
"increase charging cable length

park in front of them and charge away
"
"I think they read it as ""luxery car parking"""
"Build the parking area with the power grid in the floor. Every parking spot could then have access ""if needed"" to the grid via a short plug from you're car to the plug in the floor. This would remove the issue of using parking spots that are reserved. Wireless charging for vehicle anytime soon?"
Could they be programmed to disconnect and park themselves in non-supercharger parking once they're at capacity?
"A magnetic sensor (like at stop lights) that recognizes a car has parked.  Then, if said vehicle, doesn't activate charging, within a specified time, set off an alarm (not too load but noticeable) and then contacts authorities about an illegally parked vehicle."
"Like maybe a pole that comes out of the ground when a Tesla isn‚Äôt parked, and then when a tesla pulls up, it could emit a signal or something.  "
Because these parking spots are probably privately owned and the law does not forbid parking ICE in there.  But the government should definitely make it a fine-able offense and deduct points from their ‚Äúgood people‚Äù account.
an accidental spray across the bonnet from a brake fluid bottle will let them know that someone is pissed off...literally. Combined with 2 screws wedged into the tire nipple(s) to flatten 2 tyres should inconvenience them enough to make them think twice in future.
"A camera that looks at cars that park and tell if they are a Tesla or not , if not it launches a rocket into thier ass"
Put gates in front of each station that can only be opened when a Tesla pulls up
"Only expensive German cars.
Where is this? üòÅ"
Car lift in each bay that lifts the car off computer vision recognises that it's not a Tesla and can only be lowered if they pay a $100 parking fee. You'd probably have to give many warnings that parking there would incur a large charge.
This is legal stop complaining.
"Why not just key the cars? I'd also punch the tires out, but that's just me."
This is the definition of first world problems.
Put a little barrier which can only be operated from inside a Tesla vehicle. Ez pz!
I would start by getting in touch with whoever is in charge. There's a chance they simply don't know about the problem. 
"Landmines, that automatically detect if the car isn‚Äôt Tesla"
"Tesla can install a spike strip that can communicate with the car fob or phone. If it detects a Tesla car nearby, the spikes go down."
Suck the gas out
"RFID Spike strips. If mirrors can unfold as you approach the car, then spike strips can too."
How long is the cord? Just park right in front of them and plug in. Make them sit there.
"German car with custom plates. I‚Äôm not into stereotypes and profiling, but do these drivers come in any other versions than dick-bags and assholes?"
"A tow company would love the cash.  All they need to do is contact a local tow company and have their number posted for people to call...If its not a Tesla, its ass gets towed."
"In the US, would it be legal to call a tow company to tow one of these cars away?"
Mostly Mercedes owners. Figures....
Douchebag's
Some type of chip in each Tesla that would automatically retract some tire spikes that normally protect the parking spot. 
[removed]
They need to add tire spikes that can only be deactivated by a Tesla when they pull up to the spot. 
"This is called ""charging drama"", and it's why Americans bought more Prius Primes [than any pure-plug-in except the Model 3](https://insideevs.com/monthly-plug-in-sales-scorecard/) last month."
"In fairness, that's a useless sign. A useless *tiny* sign.

It tells you that electric cars can charge for 60 minutes.
Nowhere does it tell you that non-electric cars cannot park there. 
It's a parking space in a crowded car park, with nothing to say you can't park there - of course people will park there.

And yes, there are big 'Tesla' neon signs, but you realise that 95% of *real people* have never of Tesla?

I'm not saying people knowingly parking in EV-only spaces isn't a thing, but given the sign doesn't say they can't park there, I'd give this lot the benefit of the doubt."
"I'm all for electric and Tesla, but to be fair a lot of places don't have enough parking. So last resort is to park in an electric only parking space. Gas cars don't get special parking and electric cars shouldn't either, they just need it. Shouldn't be a gas car owners fault if the garage has no more room

Although if there is parking available it is their fault and this isn't right, but this picture tells me that is not the case from the info given to me. "
Problem solved: http://a.co/9PtBNIh
They should make them not work if you are within 50mi of your home.
"Call a tow truck, i guarantee that a tow company wont mond scooping up 5 or 6 lexaury cars. "
Welcome to the real auto world tesla owners. 
"This problem is endemic, not systemic. It's really not a big deal, except at the very minority of SC locations. "
[deleted]
"You can wait, or find another station or port"
"As a non tesla owner, it pisses me off when these are vacant. What gives you the right, minus government subsidies?"
A sensor in the floor which uses an induction loop or similar to detect if there is a car above with an engine and sounds an annoying beep if the wrong type of car is detected - a local supermarket used something like this to check disabled parking (not sure how)
Suck the charge back out of the battery after 60 minutes. 
They are a tech savvy company so the solution is clear.  Create a smart gate that communicates with the Tesla and will only open to allow Tesla cars to park in designated spaces. 
The car should move itself to a non charging parking spot when it‚Äôs done if the owner does not do it themselves 
"buisness owner needs to get a towing company to take action. 

but i dont see any signage about violators being towed at owners expense there. "
Why not just program the cars to wake up and move to a nearby designated parking space if no key is detected within a 50 foot radius when the charge is complete?
The number plates on two of those cars say ‚ÄúG0 CRY‚Äù and ‚ÄúN3VER‚Äù.. blimey
But is it illegal
"Well it's generally proven that being polite works better to persuade people, so some kind of signage or flyer that says 'please help us ensure the death of German diesel cars and not park in the wonderful spots reserved for Tesla. Thank you kind citizen'"
">what could they do about it

probably solvable by self-driving tech. just have cars that are fully charged automatically vacate spots and drive to a designated parking lot. it could be a few miles away if you want to out-asshole an asshole."
All Tesla owners get a boot to use at their discretion.
Tesla owners need Jeep buddies with winches or tow straps.
"Spikes.

Like the ""Do Not Reverse"" spikes in pay parking garages. Put em right at the front of the space. Disconnect from the charger, and the spikes release and you can unpark. Never connected to the charger? Well, swipe your credit card, cause you're being charged $20 an hour to park now."
"Leave a note, use your imagination what to put on the note for the next time you see that same car there."
"Not a Tesla owner but I own a plug-in hybrid and charge in a parking garage. Whenever I see a car that isn't charging I leave a note letting them know they're assholes and notify the parking attendant who writes a ticket. A Model X used to park and not charge, after the third note and first ticket she got the hint and now she plugs in."
I guess you‚Äôve never noticed in your life that the majority of people who own those type of cars are entitled and arrogant pricks. 
Call the tow company's number usually every parking lot has a sign with tow information.
Bring your best tire knife to slash every tire parked in an EV spot that shouldn't be there. Bet they'll stop after they have to replace $2k in tires. 
"Weight sensors underneath the charging area.

5min without charging makes steel bars come up and wont be lowered without 100¬£ payment.

Should be enough to deter idiots."
"Pay a commission on citations written to the drivers of conventionally fueled vehicles parked there.  How about a $500 parking ticket that pays $100 to whoever reports the blocked space?

Either that or one of those retractable steel posts that only opens for Tesla's cars."
Tire spikes that retract using some kind of sensor only fitted to a Tesla 
Let down all the tyres or slash them if you have a knife
"Fine them a bit less than what is fined for parking in handicap, as parking in a charger could really ruin a person's day and could severely mess up their schedule if they *NEED* to charge there."
Good
I like how that BMWs number plate says N3VER! 
"Yeah, but... It‚Äôs a Mercedes, so... yeah"
"I don‚Äôt own an electric vehicle YET. But, I say you TESLA owners should collectively buy those prank warning tickets with a tow and place them on any charging station offenders. This might send out a message out. It could, possibly, work. "
"If Tesla is only leasing those spots from a private lot/business, nobody will really give a shit. Tesla needs the lot more that the lot needs Tesla."
Tire shreaders that only retract upon detecting a super secret Tesla sound
Get more BMW buyers to switch to Tesla.
You should just remove their wiper blades and set them on top of the hood
If I had a Model x with tow package I‚Äôd yank the inconsiderate a-hole right out!  
Is there any way for them to identify a tesla vehicle? Some loud auditory shaming if a non-tesla pulls in would probably do the trick.
Slide a tire tack strip to slowly let the air out after they drive away

"Unfortunately in the UK it's not legal for private landowners to tow or clamp. Only the council/police can do that. Private landowners (car park operators, not private persons) can only issue fines. A private person is kinda SOL if someone parks on their property."
They could ad a thing that lowers only when a Tesla approaches
"Well this could be automated. If a vehicle is standing there and the charger isn‚Äòt plugged in, send a text message to the tow truck company."
"Its a stupid sign, it does not actually say the spot is only for charging.

I have the same problem at my supermarket where there are reserved stalls for people like me who shop on-line and pick-up.  There are signs that identify where you are supposed to park to pick up, but they don't actually say ""Reserved"" on them so people park there guilt free.

What is needed is a ""Reserved 24hrs"" on there.
"
"Looks similar to the one at the Washington Square Mall parking garage, here in Oregon."
"I'd get some beer, four hydraulic tire jacks, and a few buddies. Just roll out the Mercedes and leave it across/in front of the BMW. Technically the car was not moved off the property, not towed, not clamped. It is just illegally parked now."
"> ""Violators will be towed"" is usually effective.

That begs the question...why *doesn't* Tesla do that? At least in the US.

I'm wondering if things like mall-based supercharger locations aren't, in fact, EV-only spots...
"
"Require that they swipe their visa to use the charging station.

After 75 minutes you slap them with a $20 per 30 minute fee."
Spikes that will puncture tires unless it's a Tesla 
"It's not the least bit surprising that the ICE cars are BMW and Mercedes. 

Remember this study from 2013 that concluded that people who drive fancy cars are the most likely to obey traffic laws and/or show basic courtesy to pedestrians:

https://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/the-rich-drive-differently-a-study-suggests/"
Surprised California doesn't have this yet. (Many people still park in charging spots even with the tow away sign because they dont want to walk another 50 ft or so). 
I did not know this. I don't even drive an electric car but it makes my blood boil when I see non-electric cars parking in those spots. 
I left a note the other day on a ICE car that was blocking the parking spot. Guess what the guy left and the note was thrown on the floor. Wonder if I can have tesla send in the tow truck to get those folks removed. They obviously do it on purpose and not because they don‚Äôt know they shouldn‚Äôt be parking there. 
"Serious question: what happens when you‚Äôre fully charged?
In Hamburg (Germany) you can stay for 2h in a charging spot, no matter if you‚Äôre done charging earlier or not finished after 2h."
The fuck are people doing parking in CHARGING SPOTS without CHARGING? Especially when their car doesn‚Äôt even charge. Fiends!
Ohio here. I see every car EXCEPT an electric always parked at charging stations.
Maryland has had this for a while.
"Although this is kind of terrible when most chargers can be unplugged because they're not locked in.

Someone had unplugged from my J1227 adapter 15 minutes after I had left, and I got a nasty note on my windshield when I came back saying that the charger spots are for charging. My adapter was still plugged in."
This is the best solution. Keeps other EV owners from treating chargers as reserved parking spaces. It also helps to put the chargers farther from the doors. Making them less desirable.
That doesn‚Äôt solve the problem tho. 
Is that still valid on private property? looks like it‚Äôs inside some commercial building‚Äôs parking garage.
Even better would be the tire spikes they use for one way entrances. Tesla owners would be able to lower them.
[deleted]
"Or just put an insane parking cost to the charger spots. EVs for free, of course.

Enforce it by blocking combustion cars until they pay."
"When looking at the Tesla NAV, specifically at a SuperCharger, you can see how many chargers are in use, but you can't see how many are ICE'd, how many are out-of-order or how many Teslas are waiting in line.

Tesla probably knows how many are out-of-order, showing that should be easy to add, and they probably can guess how many are waiting because they have the GPS locations of every Tesla... they know how many Teslas are sitting at that location, they know how many are currently charging, they know which ones are low on charge and which ones are not.

With all of this info, they could probably logically predict how many chargers are ICE'd. But there are also, probably, a bunch of unhappy Tesla owners sitting there waiting to charger because of the ICE'd chargers that would be more than happy to inform Tesla of the **actual ICE'd count**.

Tesla should add an ICE'd button to the SuperCharger's NAV status popup that would allow a Tesla owner to report how many chargers are currently being ICE'd.

The ICE'd count could then be used to dispatch tow trucks in areas where it is against the law to ICE an EV charger. But at the least, it could be displayed on the SuperCharger's status popup so that Tesla owners that are **not yet at that charger** could reroute to a different SuperCharger, assuming remaining charge permits.

Just a thought."
What about you park your car and a bollard pops up locking your car in. To release it you either need to charge it or pay ¬£10 to the charger as well as the normal car parking fee. No one would dare to put their car in then. 
Brilliant idea. Baseball bat would work wonders too. 
until the supercharger fails to connect and sprays your tesla.
Make it a huge Tesla logo.
Free custom Tesla paint job!?!? I'm now considering ICEing these myself.
"Surprisingly, in many locations, just a traffic cone or movable metal barrier is enough. If someone has to get out of their car to move it, they‚Äôll just drive to the next space instead. "
Retractable bollards activated by the Tesla would be pretty sweet.

"In some countries (too lazy to source) fines are given as a percentage of your income. I wish the US would do this because as a general rule I see a hell of a lot more ""nice cars"" in handicap spots illegally than rust buckets."
Most dicks don't realize they are dicks. They justify their actions. I'll only be a minute. Oh they won't mind. What's the harm. You know what I'm talking about. This is why things typically suck. Everyone is the exception to the rule. Why not? It's not hurting anyone.
this guy parks
Probably not if there battery is about to die. Idk though I‚Äôm to poor to buy a Tesla. 
Reasonable? You‚Äôre on the sidewalk!
"> run lines to the far sides of parking lots so chargers aren't also the best parking spots

At least in the US, Tesla has been doing this as the default install for the last 2 years or so for new installations.  Since Tesla pays for the install anyway, it puts the chargers on the distant spots to try and minimize lazy driver ICEing."
Why did you have to sell it ? :(
"My friend bought an old type writer and made a bunch of business cards that say ""you park like a cunt"". It's simple yet effective "
"You can buy these premade on Etsy. The same seller also has a cool ""EV charging etiquette survival pack"" that includes a bunch of useful signs (OK to unplug, please don't unplug, notes to leave on other cars, etc).

https://www.etsy.com/listing/291549389/iceblocked-charger-notices-25-pack?ref=shop_home_active_10"
"Unless dicks collect them like badges of honor....

But have them printed on teally thin paper with some really good adhesive on the back so they peel off in a million pieces 
"My friend bought an old type writer and made a bunch of business cards that say ""you park like a cunt"". It's simple yet effective "
Wouldn't longer cable be an issue with all that high amperage going through it?
"Yeah I dig the double park idea, it‚Äôs the perfect tit for tat"
They aren't even the nearest spots. You have to pass about 100 spots between the entrance and the chargers as they're tucked away in a corner. 
"I drive one of those. People will assume I‚Äôm a douche anyway, so it‚Äôs a free pass to be an even bigger one. That way, nobody is disappointed. "
You think they care about the officialty of the sign?
"I've done that before, not on a supercharger but on another type that had a long enough cable to reach across the cars and plug mine in."
Hope you don't get towed!
...how would that stop people who have no intention of charging their car from parking there? 
What about non-tesla electric cars?
"But they are pissing off a customer, you.  "
Tesla paid for those 20 stalls. Who is it that is only paying for 4?
I bet they‚Äôd work about as well as the Model S door handles.
"Or it locks non electric cars in.  They can't get their car out for 24 hours, it takes up a spot that long but they won't do it again. "
"That seems a fair tradeoff to me, but often the problem is that such spots are usually more expensive to get electricity to."
"Agreed, also how full is that parking lot?  If there are no other free spots I wouldn't feel morally wrong to take a charging spot.  Wanting a free top up isn't like a disability."
I like it. Remind me Elaine tells Seifield that she did something with stuff in his bathroom...
The emotional damage.
"Awesome idea but no law needed, just smart towing companies that enact that policy."
"This should be higher up. Everyone is pissed off (understandably), but after all, these are just augmented parking spaces. If you don't need the charging feature, don't use the charging feature. But nowhere does it say that they can't be used as parking spaces.

Furthermore, there's also the question of where the spots are coming from. If Tesla builds a new parking space for Teslas, it can easily limit it to Teslas only. But if it's regular parking spots being converted into Tesla-only spots, I can definitely understand why people are annoyed about it: they now have less parking options than before. If a certain percentage of spots in all kinds of parking garages we're to be marked BMW-only, there would be a shitstorm."
Yea but none of those are Tesla‚Äôs
"They're not expensive.  Under 3k to install an electronic, retractable one."
When someone with an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) parks in an electric vehicle charging bay.
"Cooler solution:  Access point broadcasting an SSID that is known to all Teslas, similar to what the service centers have.  Communication with the car to authenticate and verify it either has unlimited supercharging, available credit, or a card on file. Then on-screen prompts guide the driver (or the car itself if autopilot-equipped) to the bay with the highest available output and retract the barrier. "
"The problem is that in a lot of parking areas, you WILL be fined if you are parked outside of a parking spot, so is it really worth it in the end?"
"Unfortunately, that won't work at a super charger. Way too much current. "
"I like the SuperChargers that have non-Tesla spaces on the other side of the charger. That gives you two shots at the charger. If the real spot is ICE'd but the opposite spot is open, you can back into the opposite spot and the cord will still reach your car. Unfortunately, most SuperChargers that I've been to are at the edge of a parking lot and there are no spots on the opposite side of the charger."
How did you get there so fast? *#dadjoke*
You're there right now? Wow.
Tesla is also a luxury brand and the cheapest new Tesla right now is far more expensive than the cheapest new Mercedes or BMW.

"Westfield car park, London "
That it is.
"This place is right near a tube station in London, a lot of people who park here use it as somewhere to keep their car all day while they do other things in the city."
This is already the case: Tesla charger only charge Tesla cars. The issue here is other cars (non EV) park the Tesla charging spot so no Tesla car can get closer to charger to charge.
"You can't make the supercharger cables much longer, never mind the 4 meters longer it'd need to be to reach around a car. Too much power to extend it."
apparently all rich people are evil? who do you think is driving the teslas?
Not sure how that'd work in a multi storey car park. 
Those aren't teslas in the bays... 
How do you propose they charge the non tesla cars parked here? 
When someone with an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) parks in a charging bay.
If only.  The supercharger cords require the car to literally be right next to the charger
Cable isn't long enough. The power that goes through superchargers puts a pretty short limit on the cable length.
These ones are actually well placed. You'd have to pass hundreds of other spots up before arriving there. 
"Perhaps, but is it legal to park at a gas pump? These chargers are the only way some people can 'fuel' up to get on with their day."
I was thithe same thing. This is used slot for car rental lots. 
Not long enough for that. It's long enough to reach the charge port of a car that reversed in and no longer.
Deutschbags.
Not possible in the UK. 
If its labeled only ev then yes but this sign  doesn't say that also handicap can park there no issues 
But the Teslas have no keys ;-;
"No, it's called asshole drivers.  I don't park a Tesla in front of the gas pump when I stop at a gas station to shop in the store."
This place is one of the largest car parks in London. Thousands and thousands of spaces. 
"Max is 1500 lbs, works on little cars only."
Hmm.. maximum capacity 1500lbs?  I guess we'd need a few of them.
"> problem

This is a great solution.  "
That'd suck for anyone without a driveway who can't charge at home. And how would that help ICEing? 
"Consider my case, we have a son 50 miles south, daughter 70 miles East. By far the fastest for us is to visit son in the morning, Supercharge 5 miles from our house for an hour and head to daughter. Our home charger is 30 amps which is great most of the time. 

Supercharging is to save time, not money, should be the policy."
It is a big deal because under no circumstance should this be happening. 
The fact that we pay tens of thousands for the privilege of using them and contributing towards the cost of building the infrastructure? What would give someone else the right to stop people who pay to use a facility from being able to do so?
They aren't electric vehicles
How would that solve a Merc/BMW in a Tesla charging bay?
That doesn't help when non electrics block the bay off like this... 
Model Xs have a tow and enough torque themselves. 
The car would still have to be in neutral to tow.
I don't think it can ever be doxxing if it's just a photograph of something that's in plain sight in public. Doxxing would be trying to take those plates and figure out who owns it and then sharing that information.
So what? Stupidity should be painful.
Well maybe you should not be parking in a place that you shouldn‚Äôt be in the first place. 
You can not get any any useful information from a plate unless you are law enforcement.

"Well ""Violators will be fined"" then. "
So if you had someone park you in in your driveway you can't have them towed off your property?
"Install a sign saying ""Car Donation Parking, non-electric cars left in this space will be donated to the local fire department for vehicle fire training."" Then just occasionally light one on fire and call the fire department so they can train."
"Just pop a tire, they probably wont park there again. lol. /s (kind of)"
" So in the UK, parking is not effectively enforced and people park wherever they want? "
"Just block them in, not like you can get towed."
"""Tires will be slashed"""
Just hang up a bunch of cameras and have an automated ticketing system for anyone overstaying more than 15min or so. 
"can you just use a jack to move their car into the middle of the street? here that seemed to get the message across when someone repeatedly blocked my driveway.
"
How do you expect Tesla to do something about it then
Sounds like the perfect storm for some white-collar vigilante justice
That photo looks like it was taken in Hong Kong. 
"""Violators will have their Tesla auto-piloted to the nearest parking spot"""
What if you would just put the sign there? Should get a lot of people to reconsider parking there
"If property owners cannot tow or clamp, how can they enforce payment of the fines?"
It's the powerful driveway fence/gate lobby at work!  Gotta protect their business!
They can tow them out of the way.
How about tire spikes at the entrance of the parking spot that only retract for a Tesla?
so much for come see the violence inherent in the system.
So does that mean I could just park blocking these guys in?
Trespassers will be prosecuted?
"That's a funny definition of ""private property"" then."
That sign seem like a pretty good candidate for a windshield sized sticker. 
What is ICEing?
"The solution is to park the Tesla in front of the offender.  Now they can't leave, and the Tesla can't be towed either."
Gate in front of spot that you can raise from car screen ?
"Slashy slash slash, Swyper gonna swype"
Park right behind these guys? Perpendicular of course. Bonus points if you can block three of them at the same time and still reach the car with the charger!
"If that's the case, could the tesla not park right behind the offender, and plug in?"
Violator‚Äôs car will be launched into space

>(b) If posted in accordance with subdivision (d) or (e), the owner or person in lawful possession of a privately owned or operated offstreet parking facility, after notifying the police or sheriff‚Äôs department, may cause the removal of a vehicle from a stall or space designated pursuant to subdivision (a) in the facility to the nearest public garage if the vehicle is not connected for electric charging purposes.

>(c) If posted in accordance with subdivision (d), the local authority owning or operating an offstreet parking facility, after notifying the police or sheriff‚Äôs department, may cause the removal of a vehicle from a stall or space designated pursuant to subdivision (a) in the facility to the nearest garage, as defined in Section 340, that is owned, leased, or approved for use by a public agency if the vehicle is not connected for electric charging purposes.

>(d) The posting required for an offstreet parking facility owned or operated either privately or by a local authority shall consist of a sign not less than 17 by 22 inches in size with lettering not less than one inch in height that clearly and conspicuously states the following: ‚ÄúUnauthorized vehicles not connected for electric charging purposes will be towed away at owner‚Äôs expense.

"It is harder than you might expect to get anti-icing laws passed. Depends on the state and the county but many times there has to be a sign AND paint to indicate that parking in the spot could carry a fine. 

Many parking lots are shared by various tenets/retail stores. Stores don‚Äôt want customers getting ticketed. Another issue is whether or not the EV charging spots count towards the number of handicap spots required. "
"It‚Äôs fairly new, working it‚Äôs way through the system and looking for sponsors.

https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=House&f=HF2751&ssn=0&y=2018"
"It‚Äôs only a bill now, not a law, but the way it is written it says ‚Äúyou may not stop or park within a specificly designated electric vehicle charging spot unless it is an electric card, and it is authorized to do so by the signage posted by the property owner‚Äù
So as I understand it, it would leave it up to the business owner to decide what kind of parking is allowed and post it on the sign.

If the sign says ‚ÄúReserved for Electric Vehicle charging only‚Äù then they would be in violation of the law if they were done charging."
"People tend to not pay attention. Also if a parking lot is full and they need a spot, they will assume that they can just park there and since they themselves have never seen an EV or know anyone with one that it won't matter if they park there."
"If we‚Äôre not careful, it will happen so often that we might develop an acronyms for it..."
Sometimes there isn't any other parking spots available
agreed. I prefer it when chargers don‚Äôt get ‚Äúprime‚Äù parking spots. It‚Äôs counter intuitive. 
What will?
"Yes, it specifies that it‚Äôs a violation as long as the owner of the property has signs indicated the spots are limited to electric car charging.
Obviously the owners could have you towed too... which is probably a steeper penalty than any parking ticket."
"Place them so anybody can enter the parking spot, the spikes just tear the tires up on exit."
"Only Teslas can use a supercharger. The plugs there do a digital handshake to ensure that there's a Tesla account on the other side and then determines if the car needs to pay or not. In the future other brands may be able to use a supercharger, but not currently. There is a converter plug you can buy, but it would only work on the home charging cables."
Or tire spikes
I was of the understanding this was in the Uk?  So you'd be speaking about a Rounders Bat (girls game)?  or perhaps a Cricket Bat?
"Destroying private property is a completely normal reaction when there's no parking. Ya know, if you're a psychopath."

"Yeah, I had been glad about the supercharger network mostly looking like that.  Made road trips pretty easy since it was pretty rare for anyone to park in one of them (except for when fucking pickups with trailers park across the entire supercharger site, the shits).  It was the day-to-day with ChargePoint or evNRG or whatever and their ""let's just get them out there"" approach that really had that problem."

Haha did you get to scowl at the ICEr when they returned?

Other types of charge stations need a different solution. Tesla chargers don't charge other cars

Except everyone ignores fines that are not council issued too.
Pecuniary penalties mean little to people driving 100k+ cars. They just consider it an expensive parking fee. 
"Correct. You have to get an eviction notice from the courts to do it legally. Only other way it can be moved is if the vehicle has to be legally 'abandoned' or a hazard (leaking fuel, etc).

It's in response to rogue landowners clamping/towing vehicles and charging extortionate amounts to release them and not doing so promptly, so only councils are allowed to do it now."
I'm not sure he's right.  How would private land owners be able to levy a fine to someone parked in the driveway?  
I would like to subscribe to your newsletter.
"In managed car parks it usually is, they're very quick to issue fines for improper parking, and if someone parks on double-yellow lines or on a dropped kerb then the police/council are usually good about fining them - but if someone parks on your driveway in a otherwise legal manner it's extremely difficult to do anything about it."
It is actually more strictly enforced since car parks just scan your number plate as you enter and once you are even a minute over the allotted time the computer automatically sends a fine in a letter to your home address.
"That's how it works. One of the big car parks near me for example is free for up to 4 hours. It's got a big screen that shows your number plate to you as you drive in and looks for your plate as you drive out.

You can get problems with double-dipping though. On two occasions I've contested (and won) fines where their system didn't see me leave, and when I visited the same place later on the same day it thought I was there the whole time and tried to fine me.

It's free car parks that have this problem. Ones that are paid are usually just pay-on-exit with a ticket and you can't leave until you've paid however much you owe anyway."
It was taken at the Westfield Centre in London.
"""Privately owned property"" would be a better thing to call it."
Can we have a TLDR please?
"Yea, I was about to say, we do have laws against that here"
"I did not see the word ticket in there. By issuing a ticket, it can, perhaps, affect auto insurance rates for that ticketed person if this is on their driving record. And maybe this would act as more of a deterrent over a tow away sign. "
"In Florida, though I don't think it is enforced:

> Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) Rules
A person may not stop, stand, or park a vehicle that is not capable of using EVSE in a parking space designated for plug-in electric vehicles. To allow for consistency for consumers and the industry, the Florida Bureau of Standards must adopt additional rules to provide definitions, methods of sale, labeling requirements, and price-posting requirements for EVSE.

Yes I think so too. They are mad that they don't get the attention Tesla gets after spending way more on their Mercedes. Jealousy.
Pretty sure I basically just spelled that out. 
"They could not get towed anyway, it's private land."
"How can those people not realize that it's a Tesla charging space, they are litterally on a red painted floor in front of a red and white supercharger, by a red panel. No, have have no respect for others or even have some form of courtesy. I highly doubt an official that doesn't include a towing warning would even change this picture."
I'm also curious about any reactions you saw.
"I didn't know that. Figured it would work like a gas station, where all cars can use any gas station."
I would charge into the cracker barrel and start making waves. But I don't mind embarrassing myself...
"I agree, here in the states non-Tesla charging is almost non-existent "
"Musk is willing to share the supercharger network, but only if a manufacturer is willing to pay the cost of the fraction of the network their cars are using which will pay to quickly expand the network and meet the new demand.  Nobody has approached Tesla to discuss this because legacy manufacturers aren't willing to invest enough in EV's or give in and use the Tesla charging standard.  They can, but they don't."
"Denying use of an EV charging station using a vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine.

EVSE DoS via ICEV.

Or just ICEing for short."
"They do in many cities that have specific ordinances that ban this behavior.  Ann Arbor, MI, US is one example local to me."
"Doesn't stop people from parking in front of them when shopping in gas station stores, even though it's even illegal in some states."
"Ah I should have looked at that link closer, that makes sense."
Correct. Some of the cost of it goes towards the network. 
"No, it's not.  It's common practice for some to try and safety-shame unnecessarily, but it's not common practice to censor."
There's not much information you could find about a person just based on their registration plate.

Which means someone committed criminal mischief...
My body shop just fixed a brand new Porsche that was keyed front to back on both sides for parking at a charging station. 
Can bricks be laid around the offending vehicle entombing it in a mausoleum of justice? 
Levy larger fines?
I would hope that Tesla paid for the court fees as a deterrent much like NewEgg fights frivolous patent cases as a deterrent to being inundated with patent cases. 
Wow. In the US you simply call a tow truck and they remove the vehicle from your property. The less legal option (due to risk of damage) is attaching it to a pickup with a tow strap and dragging it out of the way in 4Lo.
wtf thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard.  they can literally block you in from leaving your own home and theres really nothing you can do about it..
"That has to be the stupidest ‚Äúlaw‚Äù I‚Äôve heard. Like others have said, in the U.S, you can easily get this car towed and rightfully so. This car has no right to be parked in a place it shouldn‚Äôt be. 

You have a photo of the car with license plate which is good, perhaps just call Tesla and see what they do about it. "
"That explains why traveller communities and their caravans are such a thing, then."
"> hazard (leaking fuel, etc)

So, if someone is parked in your driveway, just grab a hammer and screwdriver and punch a hole in their oil filter?"
Can the court move fast 27/7? What do people do if someone decides to park on the exit ramp of a busy private parking garage and wanders off?
What about using wheel dollies and moving it into the road rendering it someone else's problem?
Why even have laws then? Just park in the middle of the street. 
Damn so if someone parked in my driveway can I just claim it‚Äôs abandoned and claim ownership of the vehicle? If I can‚Äôt have it towed sounds like it‚Äôs mine. In the us they say possession is 9 tenths of the law. 
"The reasons cited are precisely why signs warning you will get towed are so effective. Most people only need to ""learn the hard way"" one time and never want to experience that again.  

Its funny when one car does it.  Then a bunch of people follow their lead.  Then you watch the tow company have a field day with each and every one of them.  Then you see them come back to no car and whine and complain about being victimized.

Silly brits."
What the fuck. 
"Know how to ""test"" for a vehicle leaking fuel?  Hmmmm? Nudge , Nudge, wink, wink, say no more, say no more."
in that case i'd disassemble the car. 
Maybe he means the rate the tow company charges? Why would the property owner be getting a kick back from the tow company?
"If you have the right to ban someone from your property, you can issue any terms you want.  So you could write a ticket and tell the person they are banned until they pay it.

If you have a publicly accessible business, you might not be able to ban someone from entering.  It going to depend on local law."
They can't. To be able to levy a fine there's all sorts of regulations you have to meet including proper signage and registration. Private landowners in this case also includes things like car parks where they also can't tow/clamp. If someone parks in your driveway you're pretty much SOL.
"And your blog. Do you have a blog? Silly question, everyone has a blog. What's your blog? And how many fires does it contain?"
I can't just park at my neighbours house everyday can I?. Why does anyone even bother buying a house with garage if I can keep it at this guy's house?
"I know that charger! The worst thing about it is having to pay to park there... I'd never go to that shopping center for any other reason, its stupidly big.
Weird that the tesla chargers are kind of away from the middle of the car park right in one corner. it must have been jam packed for non teslas to go park there."
Heathens be everywhere!
"Nothing more than a semantic difference in this case.  If the cops won't tow it while parked in the wrong place, they don't get to bitch when the car is keyed."
"Landowner can, if they put up the correct signs, tow cars who are blocking access to charging stations."
People don't care about tickets in the US as much as getting a car towed.  Getting a car towed costs way more and is a major inconvenience.  People will risk getting tickets way more often than risk getting their cars towed.
"> Do they not pay attention to handicap signs or maternity spots either?

Maternity signs get disregarded, a lot. Handicapped not so much, since those tend to come with actual consequences. Like...the vehicle not being there when you return to it.
"
Handicap and maternity signs are far more common in everyday life than EV signs. Many people are just unaware of EVs
And charge points are on the same level as disabled parking? 
Paying $20 per hour that the car has been parked will retract the spikes. 
"I know, but I was replying to a comment that was along the lines of ""But what about the other EVs that can charge using a Tesla adapter?"" Looks like they deleted it."

Yeah it very quickly went from one extreme to the other. Some of the tricks people have done is to deliberately put some oil under the car and call the police to claim its a hazard.
"As I understand from reddit, the US has a lot stronger laws around protecting one's property."
In my city in Canada you can tow as long as the right kind of notice is posted (which everyone posts).
We always think the US is so mental. Then I look at the UK threads. Cringe.

Tesla unfortunately can't do anything other than ask the site owner to address it, I don't know of a single case where that actually resulted in action except in the cases where staff members were blocking them rather than members of the public."
">  in the U.S, you can easily get this car towed and rightfully so.

Haha, no. Tesla would have to do it.  So you would have to contact tesla and hope they are willing to call a tow truck.

Also, try towing someone who blocks a driveway in the US.  Its not always easy.  It depends entirely on the local police if they will tow it away or not.  You can't call a tow truck because most people don't have proper signage and the car is still on a public roadway.

Where I am, if someone blocks it, I have to hope the towing company is shady and takes it.  Otherwise I have to call police and they will never respond.  They will ignore it for 48 hours and only then tow.  I would have to drag the car partially in the way of traffic to get police to act."
"No, even with liberal towing laws you still won't find people willing to tow them.  The caravans are often worth nothing but expensive to dispose of.  So if you tow one, it's never claimed and the towing company has to spend money to dispose of it after holding it in their valuable lot space for weeks. "
"I was thinking fuel line. Much more dangerous, and easier to ""discover"""
"If they can make a case that it's dangerous to leave the car there then the police may be able to authorise moving it, but if its presence isn't an actual danger (but rather just very inconvenient) then they can't do much about it in the immediate term. I've never heard of anything like this happening though."
"Technically you'd be committing an offence (although whether or not the person whose car you moved actually pushes for it is another question), and you'd have zero protection if you accidentally damaged it while moving it. If you put it in a position where it was still parked illegally you'd then be on the hook for that."
"That's public land, not private. In that situation your car would be towed."
"I‚Äôd ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù spill some gasoline under the car and ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù drop a match. Hey, it‚Äôs not your fault that the other guy parked on top of a fire!"
"Don't think about it too hard.  ""Private landowners can only issue fines"" makes absolutely no sense (no cents either, private individuals have no authority to enforce a fine), and kickbacks from tow companies negates his claim that you can't tow from private land.  


He's misinformed."
If you go to the Tesla store in the store and flash your keyfob at them they'll give you a voucher for an hours free parking. Doesn't help if situations like the above mean you have to wait though.
Thank you.
"Better to leave it to the govt. to be a bad guy. Landowner doesn't want to be a bad guy to paying customers, Tesla doesn't want to be a bad guy and sour the attitude toward the company and/or electric vehicles."
">Maternity signs get disregarded, a lot

"Well yes they are designated for a specific use. Other examples are valet parking, reserved parking, compact car only parking, faculty parking, etc. It's not abnormal."
Probably cheaper than public parking in some places lol
The GM/Ford industrial complex?
"Would it even be that expensive? Could be as simple as a plastic barrier that folds down.

Half the problem is the physiological effort of violating the space. I'm sure these assholes were able to justify it to themselves somewhere, ""Oh I've got the kids with me and the other spaces are too far to walk"" etc etc"
"This would be relatively cheap, actually. You could hide an RFID chip under the bumper, and have some sort of gate system. It would still cost money, but not much"

"It's how the British write what Americans call ""tsk"". If someone is doing something inappropriate in public (cutting in line, for example), you ""tsk tsk"" or ""tut-tut"".

It may be interesting to note that these are actually meant to represent the same sound, which is called a [dental click](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_clicks). The sound is made by putting the tip of your tongue against the back of your teeth, and then pulling it away while sucking in lightly."

No support from me here. Just stating that this happens. People who vandalize others property are never in the right. The person who vandalized the car was caught on camera and paid for the repairs. 
I support that. If everyone was keying the assholes there would be less assholing in our society.

"That is where it become predatory and needs to be stopped.  They get to stick it behind the fence and charge more.  Can't afford it?  Well they get to charge you $50 or $100 per day until you can.  Lots of poor people lose their cars this way.  I get ""teaching a lesson"" but that is just wrong."
"Well, is turn about fair play then? Can you just park in front of them blocking them in? "
Clamping in general is stupid.  Towing on the other hand...
What about a little automatic gate and Tesla can push the pin to Tesla owners or use a sensor on the car that‚Äôll automatically activate it? 
"Now your lawmakers actually sound just like ours.  

We could regulate and cap the fees they're allowed to charge and the length of time to release it to owner.  We could enforce it with strict and heavy fines.  So instead of 5 people in tow trucks all day and nobody in the office to release the cars, they make sure to balance it out to avoid negating all the gains they've made.

Nah, lets just ban towing cars off your property."
"Easy solution in our city, we just heavily regulated the rates and practices of towing companies. "
"Tesla would have to do it only if Tesla owns the building lot or has rights to it. Otherwise whoever owns it would have to call the towing company.  I have people blocking my garage all the time in the city by parking in front of it. Since I only own one of the units, I can‚Äôt call and neither can the association. We have to call he cops. And hope they come at all, let alone quickly enough. However the fine is like 350$. So it usually teaches them a lesson. 

At one point one of the other unit owners on DL used a snow plow to ram the other asshole car who‚Äôs been blocking out garages regularly for months and was a complete asshole about it.  "
Good reason to get a Model X with towing package. 
"Interesting. In the US (or at least Cali) it is reversed. You have no method of giving someone a fine (although the tow company can charge for for a tow and storage fee to the owner).  If you don‚Äôt follow clearly posted instructions they are free to tow you. If they tow without good cause you can sue them or potentially file charges for theft in the extreme. I don‚Äôt think you can ever clamp a car, that is for the city only. The idea being you can remove unwanted property from your property but can‚Äôt ‚Äúclaim‚Äù it.

Block a driveway in a busy pay garage and you car will be gone in minutes.  Block someone‚Äôs house driveway and you probably have a while even if they are actively trying as they won‚Äôt have a tow company already patrolling. "
"> If they can make a case that it's dangerous to leave the car there then the police may be able to authorise moving it, but if its presence isn't an actual danger (but rather just very inconvenient) then they can't do much about it in the immediate term. I've never heard of anything like this happening though.

So what about in situations like if they are parked in such a way as to be blocking a sidewalk, preventing people from being able to use it, especially people in wheelchairs?

Here in the US (in San Francisco, a major pedestrian-friendly city), I can call 311 and have them towed ASAP, often in 2 hours or less. And they get a hefty ticket as well."
"If I was a homeowner in England, especially anywhere suburban or more dense, I'd have multiple sets with this law. You don't have to damage someone's vehicle, just park it where the police have to deal with it.  "
"Alright, so park at the entrance to the parking lot then?"
"No, I'm correct. Private Landowners includes things like car park operators. An *individual* can't issue fines, but in the picture above the context is a car park. So the owner of the car park can only issue a fine so long as they meet the requirements regarding signage and registration.

If someone parks in your drive then there's not much you can do about it. But car parks can indeed issue fines within certain rules and find out who owns a vehicle in order to issue those fines without going through the courts."
"No in the UK all you need to do is register with the DVLA (comply with some regs and stuff too) and you will have access to their database, you input the car reg number and it gives you the name and address of the owner who you then send a fine to.

Towing and clamping is not allowed on private land."

Exactly. This car is parked where it shouldn't be so let's solve the problem by making it unable to leave!
"I spent some time reading about the X, especially the tow package, which I really like the idea of.

"Who determines if instructions are ""clearly"" posted??"
"If it obstructs a throughway, footpath or road then the council will move it. You're only stuck in situations where it's legally and safely parked but somewhere that it's unwanted."
"It's not really an issue, it's *incredibly* rare to have someone park on your private property.

What does happen on occasion though is people who live near airports or train stations may find that on-street parking is taken up by people who want to avoid paying for parking. [They tend to be quite 'vocal' about it.](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/cars-street-daubed-white-paint-11791023)"
They'd have an interesting time dealing with that yes. But I'd be amazed if you could find a single instance of that ever happening. 
"So the car park owner sends documentation to the police and they issue a fine on the owners behalf?

The owner receives money in excess of the cost to tow?"
"If someone parks on your private property could you fence it in and not let them take it away when they came back for it? They would have to trespass to do so.

-

This is why the UK sucks. It's literally less free."
"You can send a scary letter talking about a fine, but you have no way to force the vehicle owner to pay.

Thats why if you ever get one of those letters about not correctly paying for parking on private land, just ignore it, and after sending 3 or 4 follow up letters, the company usually gives up."
"Sad isn't it. That said I'm not sure it's entirely non-vindictive. 

One of my local supermarkets has two Type-2 chargers. Both charges are in the least convenient location in the parking area. 

Each time I drive down, they've been ICEd. I like to take a driver over now just to check it out. The last time I saw a genuine HEV was an outlander. 

The human race is a fucking disgrace at times. "
"Seems a little harsh. 

Edit: it wasn't too harsh. "
"I was wondering what what the plural was, thanks. "
"Hahaha it does!

Lucas should design an electric drivetrain...
Natural 20 and you level the whole garage.
How are the schools save if video games are still allowed?
That would be why
It's far less likely to damage the vehicle. 
The tow company will hold the car until the owner pays for the tow (and storage if they take a while). If you were in the wrong calling in the tow that person needs to seek damages from you. Given they know where your property is they know who to go after. 
"Also depending on city and state you may need a cop to approve the tow. It also depends on if they block it on the street or in your driveway.  In the street they are impacting you but technically city property.  I believe I need to call city services for them to tow in that case, at least in my city. "
Tow the car to some public parking lot and tell the owner you would only tell them where their car is if they pay you for the towing fee...
The law. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_violation
"Interesting, thanks."
"The one that got wrapped in cling-wrap was inspired!  No damage, but no doubt really annoying to the driver."
"The car park owner makes a request to the DVLA (Driving and Vehicles Licence Authority) for the details of the vehicle owner, and they then send the fine directly without involving the police or the courts. They have to be a member of certain schemes to be allowed to do this.

There's certain strict rules that car park owners have to meet to be allowed to do this (including very clear signage about what the rules are, who to contact), and there's multiple levels of appeals processes to protect vehicle owners against abuse of the system."
"If you have a fence/gate in the way then they are trespassing to get there. But I keep saying that this almost never happens.

We do have free-to-use healthcare though. Nobody here goes bankrupt over healthcare bills. I'd rather have that than school shootings and being stuck with the bill afterwards."
"It is enforceable, they go to small claims court.

But just to be clear, make up any excuse and they will cancel it, but if you ignore it they will take you to court as 9/10 times people who ignore won't show up."

"dear god, no"
Why do you want me to design an electric drivetrain?  I'm not even sure what a drive train is.
"If supercharger cords were as long as wall chargers, sure.  I came to get a charge, I'm getting a charge.

But they're not.  You're just parking your car, when you came to charge."
"So the tow company can keep a $100k+ car ransom over a 200$ bill? That seems quite out of proportion.
What kind of proof do tow companies usually ask for that you are actually the owner of the property?"
"Sounds reasonable. While I am not 100% sure (never had to deal with it) here you would call the police and they would first try and contact the owner to move the car. If that doesn't work, the law basically says that you need to keep the cost reasonably low. So, if you're not blocked in (say, you come home and can't get into your driveway), you'll have to park on the street. If you're blocked in you'll have to have somewhere to go, and somewhere should better not be in walking distance."
That sounds a lot like stealing a car and selling it back to the original owner to me. 
"Yeah, I mean: who determines if the law has been applied correctly? For example, if the lines are faded, is it my fault for parking in the wrong area??"
Wikipedia is the law. Hear it in Dredd Karl Urban voice.
Well if I ever go to England I'll never pay to park as it's pointless. 
"They send an invoice, not a fine. They pretend it's a fine (Parking Charge Notice) but it's not."
"It's possible to have both. But you should never give up necessary freedoms.

-

Have you renewed your TV license lately?"
Seems like you've got a pair of boiled eggs down there mate.
You came to charge but you can't. Might as well get revenge
"Yes, they can. You shouldn't leave your $100k+ car randomly on someone else's property. As for what kind of proof, it would most likely depend on what sort of vehicle and what sort of property. If someone parks in the driveway of my home (something that has never happened in 35 years) then I could probably just show the tow driver my license with my address.

If they abandoned their car on the street in front of my house, it is different. Then only the city can tow it."
So the car owner can block access to a $500k private property by parking illegally?
"Makes sense. US law tends to error in the direction of the person who made the mistake suffering.  All of this said the time to get a two for a private driveway is probably going to be a while. 

Now a privately owned parking lot where you park and don‚Äôt pay? Near instant. They will have made a deal with a particular tow firm.  They are free to make that deal with the most expensive they can find (although there are likely laws that limit tow pricing in a region). "
In that case of someone wanted to press charges it would come down to the court.
"If the lines are faded you‚Äôre not at fault. However you won‚Äôt be able to argue much at the moment. You‚Äôll have to pay the fees to the tow company to get your car. Then you can sue them if you want to try to get your money back 

Tow truck drivers are a dangerous lot. They give 0 fucks and are probably threatened on a daily basis so they tend to be armed more often than not. And the dispatchers at the tow places give just as many ducks about you or anything else for that matter. So you‚Äôre better off just paying so you don‚Äôt incur storage fees. And deal with it later. 

However, I haven‚Äôt come across any signs on 22 years between that were too faded to be legible.  

Edit; spelling"
And you will be fined (even if you rent a car the rental company gets the letter and forwards it to you).
"Most car parks in England are either free (for a period of time, with ANPR enforcement) or pay-on-exit."
"Mine renews automatically, but there's nothing stopping me from not paying it if I don't actually watch broadcast TV or use iPlayer. You can even make a declaration online : http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/telling-us-you-dont-need-a-tv-licence"
"That doesn't always work so well at superchargers where that's often just a stop to charge, not your destination.  If you're completely out of range and stuck there because of them, then fuck it I guess.  I did it at a hotel I booked specifically for the chargers just to find both iced out.  I parked across the front of both cars and plugged in."
"Interesting point. I think if he manages to park his car in a way that the property becomes inaccessible, police will have the car moved pretty quickly - but I can‚Äôt imagine how he would do that?"
"Very similar here. Especially in Hamburg, it's becoming a problem (they call the fenced in lot the major towing company uses the ""car prison"") However it's starting to improve as people start to boycott businesses that make a deal with them. 
I think it's difficult. Where I live, there is a big cinema / bowling alley entertainment center. They do have a car park, but they charge for it so people first try to park for free, so blocking on street parking and the local super market. So the super market now has a deal with a towing company.
I think it would make sense to be able to force the entertainment people to include free parking in their prices - especially as their parking is half empty most of the time - but that doesn't seem to be an option."
"Charges would probably first need to pass a Cops sniff test. For charges it would need to be pretty bad. Now for a civil suit to get damages, a jury (or more likely a small claims judge). "
Did you just say that effectively I should shut up and pay otherwise I may even be killed?
And if you don't pay it? What's the incentive to pay it.
"And you can't perform bondage in the privacy of your own home, right? That's illegal now, isn't it?"
No no. Shut up and let him tow your car. People try to argue with them when about being towed. Etc. no no. They only respond like that because idiots try to use force to prevent their car from being towed (same with repo). 
"eventually, a debt collection company will show up and take your stuff."
The credit card you used at the rental firm will charge your card for the value of all the fines.
"No? What you might be thinking of was the new laws around hard BDSM porn *made and sold* in the UK. It banned things like strangulation and simulated non-consensual porn.

Can you play poker for cash with your friends in each state of the US? We can do that here. We could each make very long lists of things you can do in each country that you can't do in the other. But the US is a mess right now in terms of a social safety net. At least here if you had a chronic illness you don't have to worry about the cost of treatment, or worry about paying a deductible to see a doctor.

But now we're getting all political and off topic ;)"
"Yeah, well. I suppose the problem is that this guy has too much power, if you're meant to ""shut up and let him tow your car"", doesn't he? I prefer the UK law (that we debate here), where nobody has that power without police or court approval."
A company in England will come and take my stuff in the USA?
And I can trespass on your property and leave my car and you can't do a thing about it.
"I agree to some degree. But this power prevents people from blocking a lot of places in the city and parking on private property ‚Äúmost‚Äù of the time. So I‚Äôll take this law over the UK none any day. 
Me, nor anyone in my family had any issues with towing in 22 years I lived in Chicago. Most people I know do not either. 

They can only tow if you don‚Äôt follow the colicky rules listed on huge signs. Typically residents have special stickers on their windows so they can safely park there and non residents will be towed. 

I prefer it that way so we don‚Äôt have people parking in my spot for days so they could Uber from a party and  pick up their car when they feel like it while I have to be looking for a parking space on the street blocks away from home. 

Edit: spelling (phone) and formatting a bit. "
"Yes, there is such a thing as overseas debt collection."
"A company in England will sell the debt to a company in the USA, and they will come and take your stuff. "
"On the other hand, I can leave my car on the side of the road when it breaks down to get help without worrying that the idiot landowner will fence it in and hold it ransom. 
Laws are there to make society work. Europe is very densely populated compared with the US. When I lived in England, I loved the fact that I could just hike across the farms. 
Now of course the farmer is less free, because he can‚Äôt shoot me when I walk across his land, but I am more free because I can enjoy a cross country walk without worrying to be shot. "
"In terms of street parking, the UK's system is (usually) coupled with parking wardens (run by the local authorities). The guy who Ubered off the party will have to pay ¬£60 fine. If he does not pay, it would go to debt collectors and he will have his credit damaged. Anyway, I think we're just talking extremes here, incidents of parked cars blocking others for too long are very rare in the UK as well (even without towing)."
Agreed :)

That's a slightly altered Ge(Gamma)made to look like an F and is Cyrillic
"Ugh, I think the first episode where they attack negan's base(?) is where I quit, the ''battle'' was so unbelievably bad It was the final straw for me, quit mid episode. When a 10+million viewer show can't choreograph proper gun fights and provide great looking special effects it's a ''go fuck yourself'' from me. The world needs to be real for the characters to be real as well imo. "

I don‚Äôt think they were going for actual Cyrillic - just replacements that looked like English letters. That‚Äôs really the only way to maximize the reach of that joke.
"It‚Äôs [Faux Cyrillic.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faux_Cyrillic) That said I think it would have been cooler to spell it correctly, since Facebook‚Äôs color and font would have made the joke pretty obvious."

Great phrase, I‚Äôm stealing that."
What does it say on the side? You can partially see the lines

I think I just saw this car on the Facebook page... 
"There is an amazing Mexican/Italian restaurant in Elk Grove, not far from the big Apple campus. That's all I have to add to this conversation. "
Is that over by the Peet's coffee and leatherby's?  That's sharp 
"Holy shit that's slick AF. I'd never buy it as a single scratch would drive me insane though. 
"
This is so badass.
Elk Groves coming through on r/Tesla
Let‚Äôs hope those glasses he‚Äôs getting are going to help him keep that baby in tact longer. 
"So it looks like it's obvious for the rest of you guys, but how is it legal to drive a car with no visible license plates? I understand it's still pretty easy to identify, but still..."
"Me: I really like this, but I wish it had more color.

<shows the wife> 

Wife: I don't understand that statement. 


Me: It's like when we go to that Banana store.


Wife: I get it, but shutup "
Is the Model 3 really that rare?
"I was in elk grove today with my Model 3, thought this would be a picture of my car. Wrong color :p"
I bet its the owner of Nothing Bundt Cakes
This is basically what I want. 
This look great and suits the 3 to me. I am not too much a fan of matte wraps and black outs on the S though. 
And they have good taste in shoes ‚ù£Ô∏èüôåüèª
"They should let people decale plates on, so you don't lose the aerodynamics."
For someone reason it looks really plain. 
Is it expensive to coat a car like this? 
I found a purple one in town near Seattle. I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes until I was close enough to make out all the details.
[saw one near me](https://i.imgur.com/tTGLbeL.jpg)
I‚Äôve never liked the mode 3.... until now.

"My lord, is that legal?"
Such a beautiful car
H o t
Is this the original paint?
That's sexy.
That is gorgeous.
I don't even have words for how beautiful that is.
I nutted
"Way to make a car look cheap. Good job, guys! "
I‚Äôd rather ride a city bus in San Francisco than drive a Tesla in Elk Grove. 
"It says ‚ÄúDOUGLAS‚Äù subtitled ‚ÄúCustom Clothier‚Äù 
The logo is a large letter R. with a button taking place of the period. "
"I assume this is not Elk Grove MI then.  Hometown of Ash Williams, Deadite Slayer."
"I was here just this past weekend! Elk Grove, CA  part of sacramento county"
Lol what‚Äôs it called? I might visit sometime
"Amazing it‚Äôs still in business, maybe.  "
Agreed. That place is awesome
There's an apple campus there? Not just retail but a corporate office?
the peets you can only see in the winter when the leaves aren‚Äôt covering the sign?
Yup. Surprised I came across it
My guess would be that this is a wrap. 
Good thing you can peel it off and re-wrap that panel for pretty inexpensively.
"if you ceramic coat it, that becomes less of an issue"
A large number of states also don‚Äôt require front license plates at all. 
[deleted]
It's not. My friend has one and my mom has one. My dad has a second reservation for whoever in the family wants to buy it. I'm used to seeing them so I don't even respond anymore. Expecting down votes!
"Lol. If I saw this one as well as yours, I would‚Äôve taken every chance possible to snap a pic. 

The karma industry is serious business. "
How do you like it? 
"It can be. I am getting mine done whenever I get mine. Depending on the wrap, it could be 3-6 thousand. The more expensive ones are chrome. "
Just go to the hardware store and get a few cans of spray paint. It's super easy!
No. It's likely a wrap.
That car is cool as fuck. The hell are you on.
I agree. It looks ridiculous.
I too agree. Same car straight from factory looks much better in my opinion. 
San Francisco: where only the homeless are not technically millionaires!  But they get rounded up and put on a bus to Anaheim anyhow!
R Douglas is a well known tailor in Sacramento. Fairly high end.
">large letter R

Team Rocket is buying Tesla cars! "
Is it supposed to be like that or did some one do a wrap over existing paint/sticker.

It‚Äôs Elk Grove ca 
"I figure ""no plates"" would give it away, but does IL normally allow recently purchased cars to drive without plates?  Cali is the only state I've heard of that does that."
Todo Un Poco
"To be honest I'm not entirely sure what they do there but it is 4 huge buildings.

Yes!  I've lived in Elk Grove a year and a half and just now realized we had a Peet's about a month ago!
"I've yet to see one in Elk Grove, cool!  What's the writing on the driver side door?  Business info?"
‚ÄúCeramic‚Äù coatings do not prevent scratches (basically longer lasting alternative to wax). You may be thinking of a paint protection film. 
afaik you can't ceramic a matte wrap. closest thing u could do is wrap a matte Xpel Stealth wrap but that's prob be pretty freakin' expensive.
I don't think it has anything to do with supercars. I believe it's based on plates not being required for a certain time period after a car is newly purchased.
"In California you have 6 months from date of purchase to mount the plates.  You do need a paper ""plate"" that goes in the front Window and is too tiny to be of any use to anyone. "
"Hmm, does the model 3 count as a supercar? I thought it was supposed to be the affordable-er one lol. Thanks for the answer."
The car is absolutely amazing! Puts a smile on my face every time I get in it :)
"Matte black in so sick, I really want to do that with my S along with a chrome delete "
 It looks like a rattle can paint job. 
A car tailor?
".... *ding!* üåü

(I read that in the 'flying away, defeated' voices) "
"Ha, wondered how many Elk Groves there are. I'm in IL as well."
"Seriously--a chain link fence holding in elk that have antler spans as long as a compact car. There's also a walking trail inside the preserve, so there's parking areas. There are no feeding signs, but everybody goes and feeds them. Even when there's calves everywhere. People let their babies and little kids feed them, so they can pet them. Completely ignoring the bull that could trample them in a second. "

"In 2005, my best friend sold his San Francisco three bedroom normal sized home with an ocean view of the Pacific for a massive 5000 sq. home in Elk Grove. 

The deal was done before I could talk him out of it. 

Today that SF home would be worth four times what he paid for it, while he lost money on his Elk Grove home. I love my friend, but that‚Äôs one of the dumbest moves I‚Äôve ever seen.   So stupid. "
"Tesla seems to have no problem giving them to you with no plates in IL, and I've had good luck with other brands by simply requesting they not install the plate.  Same experience with Tesla in CA and IL."
"CA won't be doing it anymore in a few months AFAIK, if they haven't stopped it already.  "
That's the spot. Great food and service. 
I love this place. Was working out there for about 4 months last year and went every single week!
i freak out whenever i see a tesla out here. we need more. a gentleman comes through my drive through in a blue model s every once in a while and it‚Äôs a pleasant surprise every time. 
I posted it in one of the other comments 
"From the ceramic pro site:

>This new glass shield prevents minor scratches to your clearcoat and acts as a sacrificial layer. This preserves the original factory paint."
"Pretty sure you can coat a matte wrap, nothing is physically stopping you. It'll end up looking kind of like a Satin paint job."
"And even then, most cops aren't gonna bother. I haven't had front plates on my car since I bought it, been about 4 years now. Enforcement comes in waves; I used to work at a service center in Rocklin and every spring for about a month we'd have 2-3 people per day coming in with fix-it tickets, and then nothing the whole rest of the year."
Has nothing to do with that.  Newly purchased cars don't get a plate.  You drive like that for up to like 60 days until you get plates in the mail.
Are there any panel fitment issues?
Maybe it‚Äôs their car? They could use it to drop off orders.
A cat tailor. 
There's one in California too lol
"Well shit also from IL
Edit: Well I guess we maxed out at three"
"I'm not even in IL, I've just been there haha

I had the same question."
There are dozens of us!
"Don't remind him.  Regrets are a son of a bitch.  

I was looking in silicon valley (palo alto, mountain view) in 2011 for my first house.  It was knee deep in recession still. There were some deals for $400,000 range.  I ended up buying a house for $120,000 cash in Florida instead.

Sure, I sold that house last year for $250,000 which was cool and all.  I used that to buy a house in Rocklin for $500,000 that is exactly what the sellers bought it for 10 years ago.  Although they didn't do shit for maintenance, where as I completely revamped the Florida house before selling.

Those houses in the valley however... $1M+ regardless of condition."
What drive through if you don't mind me asking?  
 they are talking about swirlies from a rag.
would love to see some high-res pics side by side as I'm weighing this now. I know like 3M says specifically not to wax it. I have to dig more I guess
"Just about the only time I've heard about a crack down was when a municipality would add red light cameras, since those take the photos from the front."
"Hmmm. Minor one where the front passenger side door takes a little more force to close than expected, I think that‚Äôs due to a panel misalignment. I‚Äôm going to have the SC check it out next week"
I‚Äôm just really confused because idk what a car tailor is
"> [cat tailor](https://i.imgur.com/Q7NKsjy.png)

"Yeah, I googled it, that's apparently where it is."
"Westpark Roseville here, man. *fistbump"
i work at taco joint in the area. they‚Äôre developing the area into a small community but it‚Äôs next to a winco and there‚Äôs a theater down the street
"Well, I think they also mean that scratches won't be as noticeable as long as they aren't deep enough to reach the paint/wrap"
"Yeah, I couldn't figure out how to word it right, but after the ""enforcement comes in waves"" I had ""usually when red light cameras get installed"", but deleted it before posting."
Doesn't sound too bad. I wonder how the model 3 fares in colder climates like negative 20-30C
"Lot of locals here, they just come out of the wood work when something interesting is spotted at the rocklin store"
"I do know one guy who got a ticket just this year in the 91 Express Lanes by the CHP.  But I think it was more of a case they pulled him over thinking he didn't have his transponder (he did and it was on the window), so they felt the need to ticket him for something since they'd pulled him over."
"I don‚Äôt know unfortunately, the coldest it‚Äôs been in the sac area is 0C. Regen braking gets limited pretty heavily below 5C"
"Do you know does the 3 have a battery heater? I would expect so, but unsure."
"I think it does, but I‚Äôm not sure. I don‚Äôt preheat my car because I‚Äôm cheap and wanna save the electricity so I don‚Äôt really know how effective preheating is :p"
:D How much does power cost around there?
"Oh probably around 10-12 cents/kwh. 

All in all though I can not recommend this car enough. My favorite part is showing it off to friends/coworkers, it‚Äôs a blast. "
"I would buy one, but 18 month wait is a bit steep :P also no info on rust protection as roads are heavily salted around here."
Not on PG&E eh?  Lucky bastard.
"Yeah, quite a bit of the model 3 panels are steel. I believe the doors are aluminum but the outer body panels are steel.

I was a day 1 line waiter in 2016 so I know how you feel with the wait haha"
"Worth the wait though, I bet :D

How's the range for you?"
"Better than advertised. I got 178wh/mi on my 8 mile commute(zero elevation change), which would put my total range in the high 300s. Maybe 370 or 380 miles. 

My vampire drain is no where near as bad as some people have it. Approximately 2 miles/day loss"
"Damn, that's good. What kind of speed are you doing on your commute?"
"35-45 mph. The motor is most efficient at 22 mph if I remember correctly, but even autopilot‚Äôing at 70mph I get about 230wh/mi which is the 330 miles that the nhtsa got on their testing "
Amazing.
