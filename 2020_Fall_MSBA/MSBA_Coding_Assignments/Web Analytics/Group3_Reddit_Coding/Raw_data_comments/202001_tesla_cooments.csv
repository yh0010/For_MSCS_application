good job Elon!
The only billionaire I’m actually happy to hear about
He will be the first trillion USD person
"(not accounting for inflation)

**EDIT** For those not wishing to read articles... OP's article and the CNN article both state this clause. 

The past values for Ford and GM shares would be higher if adjusted for inflation, of course. The 1999 pinnacle for Ford shares would be worth $117.8 billion in today's dollars. And GM's top valuation, reached in 2017, wouldn't be much greater although its shares did reach $61.3 billion in 1999, worth $94.8 billion today.

"I expect a new company to be started because of this. Hopefully, something that takes carbon out of the air or make it profitable to recycle around the world."
"It's funny to think most people think that Tesla is a car company. They are a battery company, an supercharger station company, a factory building company, an AI software company, and btw, they happen to produce cars. People are going to wake up very soon and realize that Tesla is bigger than Sony, Panasonic, Volkswagen, Daimler, GM, BP, Total, Uber all together."
Chump change compared to what he will earn from FSD or starlink. Elon will probably be a trillionare in 2030.
Thanks to Elon and the team many people got richer too.
Most valuable “American” car company. But remember Tesla isn’t a car company.
"Elon, please install solar powered desalination plants along the coast lines of Australia.."
More money to make cat girls. I like what I’m reading
Electric self driving cars exist. I feel like this should be dominating conversation everywhere but it isn't.

Big middle finger to Ford. How the tables have turned!
It’s not just a car company
That's because they are a tech company who happens to make cars not a car company.
Good.  Hardest workin' man in show business.
"I bought at $236 back in May and just sold most of it at $482.  (Yay  me!)..   It felt oversold back then, and it was by far the best-selling car in Scandinavia, supplanting Mercedes and BMW, so it smelled like a winner.   But it can't go up this fast indefinitely.   I expect more volatility and a decline, at least in the short term.   Long term I'm thinking it may hit the 550's within a year if the chaos Gods continue to smile in Elon's direction."
The fuckin man.
I feel self conscious just buying food week to week :)

Good for him hard work pays off usually
Remember when everyone said Tesla would fail in the past few years OMEGALUL
Do you think he planned that?
Ever? Sure if you ignore inflation :D :D :D
Someone with expertise please tell: is it too late to buy Tesla shares?
Damn I can’t wait to get a Tesla.
Can we get to 6.9? Very epic
I'm really happy for Elon :)
TRES COMAS BRO
"""Richer."" He's worth $2.1 Billion more but until he liquidates that money its a moot point."
Yay

And people were saying this companies where going under not to long ago
Smoke weed errday
Happy for the lad.
damn the goverment money laundering funds...
Not surprising to anyone with brain cells.
I'm sorry Ford.
This progression I do welcome.
tesla is more than a car company
420 puts ASAP.
It’s not just a car company. They provide the world with 50% of batteries too.

Oh ya
"An awkward feeling creeps in when beginning to feel bad for traditional auto and their lengthy opposition to embracing electric and sustainable models, more for the many employees, less so for X percent of soulless used sales staff."
"Always hate these Tittle's.

Stock doesn't represent how much money somebody made. It's just value. Elon didn't get 2.1 billion dollars. His company at this moment is valued more but that can change tomorrow. It can get more or it can get less. We all know what stock and value really means. Has nothing to do with somebody getting richer by anything in that same margin. Please stop the click bait bullshit and just only put the last part in the title. Nobody got richer unless they sold all their pre owned stock right now."
We all going to ignore this guys username?
"The most valuable, but not the most profitable. If you can turn profit, then it’s all useless."
Stock market bubble from the Fed pumping new money into the system. It's all gonna come crashing down soon. Almost certainly by the end of the year.
Awesome
"Can we have like a cheap electric car for poor people, I mean, normal people not rich AF? Thanks Elon!"
He better invest in CatGirls now
"Super happy for Elon and I'm glad Tesla is succeeding, but that statement is just crazy to me. 2.1 billion, in one week. That would take me over 25,000 years to earn. 2,500 lifetimes. There is no reason anyone should have that much money. He is one of the few people I trust it with though."
Imagine cheering on a billionaire. You cultists are completely ass backwards.
"*more valuable

He doesn't literally have $2.1 billion more dollars on his bank account(s). He's worth that much more."
Cool. I work a fulltime job and still can't pay for everything. Fuck off with this bullshit.
r/hailcorprate
That's great. I'm sure he'll enjoy jacking off to those numbers while the people doing the actual work slave away and other people starve in the streets.

Who cares about rich people. Every tesla I see is driven by an ASSHOLE.
How long until his wealth trickles down to me?
"Elon, can you pay off my student loans?  I just want to be a doctor but I feel like I will end up an indentured servant to Fedloan and Nelnet."
I bought TSLA for $14 a share the day it went on sale. I own 100 shares. Should I sell???? I don’t exactly need the money now but I can’t bear to lose it either
"Imo the company is overvalued, it went from a completely undervalued, laughed at company to a hype stock. I’m a big Tesla fan myself (I have bought stock of it at around 230$ in my simulator account, not 18 yet...) but the valuation of the company is borderline ridiculous."
Fuck him
I’m still hung up on the fact that he dated Grimes. And apparently they tried to get Azalea Banks to have a 3-way.

"There aren't even a million Tesla vehicles on the road, so HOW THE FUCK DOES THIS WORK?

Y'all need to stop giving a billionaire zero interest loans is what's at hand here."
So is he gonna spend it on global climate change initiatives? Or just hoard it like all the other asshole billionaires.
Wow. Reddit’s reaction of Musk vs Bezos. Even though there are plenty of examples of both involving in similar anti-consumer and exploitative behaviours.
"This is such a joke. 

They provided 50k cars while Ford produced 98k trucks. Edit: in Q1 of 2019

Call it what it is, the valuation is that of a TECH company, not an automobile company."
This is disgusting.
"I don’t get this, I don’t know a single person who drives a Tesla , hell , I don’t think I have ever seen one."
"Is that the money he kept for the roadster orders or the cybertruck orders. 

Or the money set aside for those 1 million+ driverless taxis"
Not only that but the board has approved him to smoke as much weed as he wants
I'm gonna stop listening to myself that it's to late.
I still don't get the company or why it's even worth $170 let alone 4000.
Seriously what happened? Last time I checked tesla stocks plummeted
I think it’s laughable that other companies are still releasing ICE cars. Perhaps there’s some argument to be made about long-range trucks/vans/SUV’s. But little city-car compacts that will never be driven outside of East-Atlanta? Why are companies still making compact cars with four-bangers?!
Any chance you have a link to this?
"Nah, Sony has a Tesla killer on deck.

Edit: This is a joke."
"This.  I have been being downvoted to oblivion on posts (mostly about VW) where I point out that its great they are ""talking"" about making 1,000,000 EVs, but the bottom line they don't, right now, have any viable mass production EV available to people who want to buy in the United States.  Meanwhile they are still developing new ICE tech instead of going all in, which they need to do if they want to actually have anything close."
Even beat tech companies. You’re absolutely right.
"The big car brands does not want to introduce new cars at CES. In that regard, CES didn't really show anything."
Sony is as close as a lot of ICE car companies to mass producing EV cars now.  That made me lol
"I dont think he cares about the money, if he did a car & space company is worst things to start"
I doubt he’s going to sell any shares anytime soon
I have seen him look at a rocket and let me tell you no one has ever looked at my rocket like that.
He's been silly rich for so long it hardly matters at this stage
I wish I was a little bit taller
"I know, it would be great, my net worth would finally be $2.1 billion dollars"
I just want $3 million.  I could retire and just live off that until I die.  God I just want to sit down in peace and not worry any more.  I'm so damn tired of being diligent all the time.
I wish I was $2.10 richer
I only need 2 million and I could just maintain my current lifestyle debt free.
I just wish I had a Tesla
I wish my parents loved me
It will be a 2.1 billion percent increase for me
you would hedonically adapt quite faster.
I wish I had three wishes.
Hell id take anything richer lol.
I wish I was $2.1 million richer.
maybe next week man!
I wish I was $2.10 richer ...
I wish I had 1/1000th of that as my net worth
"Id take 2100 richer. Id be able to fix my car, pay back old debt, and buy a pillow. Or just a 2100 pillow.

Why are nice pillows so expensive t.t"
"I wish I had 1,000$ that would solve all my problems and stop me crying myself to sleep every night. Billions is nothing for them but hundreds and thousands is everything to us normal folk...."
"Based on my understanding of how stocks works, Elon isn't really richer from this, because to spend that money he would lose control of Tesla, which he obviously would not want to do."
"On a different note, I really hope he continues dumping money into space stuff. Like, I need him to be dumping money into space stuff. I don't necessarily think I'll ever get off this planet personally, but how fucking hopeful I would be thinking that my progeny might get to grow up on a different planet. Fuck waiting for a government to decide science is real, again. Let the rich people make it common sense and user friendly."
Sad but mostly pathetic
He‘s kinda an asshole tho

Asteroid mining is my bet for what will push him over the threshold."
Not if they ever pass that wealth tax.
Bezos
"Yeah, no"
"He probably won't. Musk invests in a lot of high risk, low return concepts. Rockets and electric cars were never a wise investment, he made them work because he thought they were important. Tesla came close to failure multiple times and only really gained its footing recently."
"Well...to be fair GM and Ford has affordable cars and also high end expensive cars.

The only way to own a Tesla is to be well off. There is no Ford Focus of the Tesla world so if modern day Tesla is even coming close, that’s amazing."

Par for the course for any reporting on the stock market. It’s almost impossible to find any news about stocks that’s worth a damn beyond the prices reported.
"""right in the article"" you ain't even read it lmao, it literally says not accounting for inflation. they know if you whipped out the ye ol calculator technically ford was worth more back in 99."
"So, inflation adjusted, F is worth 28% of what they were back in 1999?  They've declined 3.6% per year?  At this rate they'll be gone 8 years."
"Tesla was a fully functioning car company before musk, it wasnt from nothing."
Yeah elon with his south african emerald mine parents came from nothing
"I think what Tesla/Elon Musk has done is amazing. But let’s not rewrite history. One of his keys to success has been gov subsidies thatTesla didn’t need.

Musk was already a billionaire when he subsidized the Model S on the back of taxpayers via a government loan. A loan which Tesla paid back as soon as reviews of the Model S came out.  Socialize the losses. Privatize the gains."
Cyber westfalia?
"They are *for now* as it’s their main profits.

But they are on track to be an energy company that has a hobby of making cars."

"I agree, they’re an energy company."
Well they sell cars so
Everyone's missing the mark with your comment and assuming you're talking about solar and stuff. That's not it. They're a tech company that sells cars and energy products. They're more like Alphabet than Ford
"Plenty of automakers make things that aren't cars.  The vast majority of revenue comes from selling cars.  Thus, car company."
"Some people made a similar remark on twitter and grimes, who is a feminist and a millionaire, answered that she doesn't need any man's money and she is self founded."
"This will be the biggest mistake of his life. Bezos' ex-wife's cashout was already insane. This one will be multiples of that. Then imagine a possible crazy person with billions in cash, a broken heart and a grudge. Fun times."
"The problem with carbon capture is those companies are turning it into fuel. So it's not carbon capture and keep, it's just carbon neutral. Better than burning coal or gas of course, but we need a carbon tax on the highest polluters so then we can capture carbon dioxide and NOT burn it, making it a net positive for the planet."

"This is like saying Ford is a car company.tbey are also a website, a mobile app, and a mobility company. How is that any different? Tesla also doesn't make all the parts of their cars just like other automotive companies."
Tesla is going to turn into conglomerate.
Give a company enough money and time and they will integrate vertically. But it has always been a car company.
"Their batteries are made by Panasonic. Supercharger network alternatives exist in Europe, and can be built up in States as soon as there's a real need for it. They are pretty bad at building factories, and even worse at employing people in them. Their AI is not terribly impressive, certainly not to the point of making drone taxies anything more than a pipe dream any time soon. Mobileye/Intel have a much more sound development model and plenty of partners and resources to implement it. Their grid energy storage solutions are interesting, but their solar is underwhelming, especially with Walmart scandals. Their cars are still very impressive, but the first movers advantage is nit going to last more than a few years longer, thanks to dieselgate.

Their bizarre valuation is due solely to investors' trust in Musk staying disruptive and motivational. If the guy has a stroke, the stock will topple."
SpaceX goes public when? My investment accounts are ready /u/ElonMuskOfficial
Ask mark Speigel how much money he’s made. Lol
Until the Mach e comes out and destroys Tesla’s share of the market. Fords not going anywhere.
True. They also sell tshirts.

nope....liquidity
"""recessions"" don't hit the same they used to. I do agree something is coming as the fed is dried up but the odds it's as bad as previous ones is unlikely."
"He doesn't have that much money. The stock value makes his ownership stake worth that much. In the meantime all revenue goes back into the company to employ people and produce green tech. Bezos actually realizes his wealth and sells billions in stock, musk does very little of that"
By what evidence  do you trust him with.
"Do you comprehend the difference between unsellable stock value increase, and actual wealth/goods/cash? Cringes me out that you have ""investor"" written next to your name but don't understand something so basic."

"Yes, we all know that already"
"Some people are better looking. Some people are faster or stronger. And yes, some people work less hard, yet are more productive (Elon works incredibly hard though). But we can't all be equal.

If the wealth was redistributed, the price of everyday living would go up more than you think anyway."
"> Fuck Elon Musk

We need more Elon Musks in the world, so yep I hope he gets to have many more kids. He's doing more for the planet than anyone else at the moment."
More like a rising tide lifts all boats.
Got a Bezos example?
"Im pretty sure thats what horse people said when cars started to come around
Jelly much?"
Depends. Are you going to do any thing? Or do you want a fat cheque just mailed to ya?
"you realize that they didn't just back up a semi truck with two billion in cash right? It's all stock options. Judging by his past, most if not all of this is going to go right back into Tesla / SpaceX / Boring / Neuralink"
"As someone who worked for years at a large auto company, this view is what will cripple the long time incumbents."
"People, or more specifically investors, are valuing Tesla as more than just an automotive company. They are also a software, self-driving tech, and machine vision camera company. They are a battery chemistry and manufacturing company producing directly or in partnership more than half of the world’s lithium ion battery production. They are a consumer- and utility-scale battery storage company, the third largest US solar panel production company, and a solar rooftop leasing company. They are an insurance company. A material science company. A heavy-duty truck company. It’s the largest fast-charging EV station network in the world. And the only car company posting steady double-digit growth. 

It’s a whole different animal than its direct competitors in the automotive sector because of this diversification and vertical integration, plus it doesn’t have decades of legacy costs associated with retirees and plants. 

Finally, it’s the whole question of whether legacy automakers can successfully transition to EVs, and so far that’s not a foregone conclusion. The Porsche Taycan has the poorest efficiency of any EV on the market and only achieved 201 miles EPA when Porsche was promising 300. The Mercedes ID3 is rolling off the assembly line without software and they’re going to have to manually install that whenever it’s done on tens of thousands of cars. The E-Tron is a great car but generally mediocre on range for one’s dollar. Mazda is purposefully detuning their debut EV so that it doesn’t seem too peppy compared to their Mazda 3s. The Ford Mustang Mach-E looks pretty solid, but going toe to toe with the Model Y is going to be tough with Tesla’s demonstrated lead on efficiency and accelerating economies of scale. Add on the legacy automakers’ EV’s general lack of focus on self-driving and software-driven tuning with OTA updates, and their wholly absent fast charging network and consumers are voting with their wallets by choosing Tesla.

It’s not like the legacy automakers won’t be able to make good EVs, it’s just not the simple task everyone seems to think it would be. The narrative was that as soon as the legacy automakers decided to make an EV, Tesla was done, and that’s just not the case. 

Finally, for investors looking for a safe bet to get into the EV, battery, and autonomy spaces, Tesla is a far better bet as a pure EV, BEV, and autonomy play than GM, Ford, et al."
"While your point is true, I don't see why it matters."
"Don't be jealous. If anyone deserves to be a billionaire, he does. Think what good he can do with that money. He even said he'd hate to retire to a luxury tropical island because he wants to use his brain and do good for the world."
Where do you live ? Montana? 😂
I live in a country 'run' by a government that is actively hostile to anything that's not burning raw coal and yet I still see Teslas here.
Space x was the main problem with that though
Probably thinking if we are this big when he smokes a little lets have him smoke a shit ton. Tesla becomes more valuable and the board becomes his supplier
Board acting like Elon's mom out here lmao.
Joke or no?
Up 168% since june
Bolivia had a coup now their lithium is elons
"> Why are companies still making compact cars with four-bangers?!

Because they're cheap and most people need cheap."
"They don't have the resources for R&D, changing their factory tooling, and establishing supply chains."
"ICE cars are still going to be the norm for the next (probably?) decade, and we need them to be. Infrastructure for EVs are still not at the point where a mass turnover can be handled. Not saying we won’t get there but people already complain how superchargers are busy..."
100% it’s cost. They can make shitty ice cars cheaper and have much larger profit margins to boot. Eventually battery prices will drop and it’ll be cheaper to make electric cars. You see Tesla making high end luxury cars because the luxury car market has much higher profit margins although teslas margins aren’t anywhere near bmw’s. Tesla has done everything to cut cost imaginable and they are still expensive compared to the average market price. Even when battery prices drop to a point to make them competitive with gas cars the older manufactures will have to change their business models to try and compete with teslas prices. IMO Tesla is at least 10 years ahead of the competition right now and the gap is growing.
Until electric cars are cheaper than ICE cars people will continue to have a huge reason to not go electric
It’s because legacy car makers have to be profitable and the cheapest cars can’t be 50k.
My little city-car compact with a turbo 4 happens to live at an apartment with no way to charge at school. Most of the country once you leave a metropolitan area doesn’t work for EVs. That’s why manufacturers still sell gas powered cars like hotcakes compared to electrics
"They have to spend billions in CapEx, get rid of thousands of jobs, and stop paying dividends to get it done.

Try selling that to your shareholders.... most of whom only hold the stock because of the dividend payouts.

It's way easier to start an EV auto company from scratch than it is to transform an ICE one into an EV one."
Ask Kodak why they kept making film and cameras after they invented the digital camera.
Because millions of people need a car that can go further than 200 miles and can’t afford 50k.
"> I think it’s laughable that other companies are still releasing ICE cars.

There's this thing called inertia, and it applies to everything.

Yes, ICE is in the past, but it takes time for anything to change."
"I feel like I say this all the time but, there is still a huge market for ICE cars for even people who WANT a electric car. If you street park in a city, an electric car is a complete hassle."
This is the most /r/teslamotors post ever
">Why are companies still making compact cars with four-bangers?! 

1.  Because people are still buying lots of compact cars with four-bangers.

2.  Because most companies have to be profitable.  Tesla is quite unique in that regard."
"Cost. Electric cars are still significantly more expensive than ICE cars and savings in fuel don’t cover the difference, especially if you only do city driving. 

Then if you go often out of the city you hit the range issue with many of the affordable models.

I just bought a new ICE car in November and while I strongly considered electric cars and plug-in hybrids, it still was going to cost me 5k+ more to own an electric car over 5 years, not considering the electricity cost, and increased insurance premiums for an electric car.

Until the total ownership cost is on par or at least nearly on par with electric cars, ICE vehicles will continue to sell well. And as long as people will buy them, companies will make them.

It’s a hard sell when they sell a Chevy Bolt for $45k CAD before government rebates ($31k after) when you can get a bigger and more comfortable car with a gas engine for like $17k CAD. I’ll never save 10k+ in fuel and maintenance during the ownership."
"Because most of legacy auto is still trying to delay the electric transition as long as possible. They should be scrambling for tech and supply chains. Desperately. But they aren't doing that, instead, they try to soothe their investors with crappy EVs that barely anyone's gonna buy (étrons, if you will), and all of their actually serious efforts to deliver a great car are still ICE-based. That's how you get Prius-like hybrid smugmobiles, or i3-like tiny ""city cars"" (pronounced like City Wok), to establish an image that EVs aren't there yet, that yes, they are the future, but that's still the future, just wait, and oh, by the way, buy that ICE car in the meantime, please.

No idea why they're banking so hard on Tesla failing, but it's not gonna happen, that's getting more painfully obvious each day. Especially since lately we're even seeing some tech companies join Tesla. Amazon pushing Rivian, Sony straight up making its own car, Apple being rumored for years now. EVs provide the perfect opening for the tech industry to expand into the automotive market and completely take it over (especially if legacy automakers keep rejecting the idea of an electric transition) and these are the biggest companies in the world. With that, the transition is going to be inevitable even in the unlikely scenario that Tesla fails (which it won't, no use hoping for that).

2020-2021 are going to be transformative years for the industry. If Rivian succeeds and more companies start getting into making cars, specifically EVs, all the far-fetched hopes of the legacy automakers are gonna die. Suddenly, they're gonna be years behind. In fact, they're already years behind, but now they can still deny how crucial this is for their future, provided they even have one."
"Because believe it or not, but not everyone lives in east atlanta?

Also, batteries are far from the only solution to the transportation problem, I have no idea why everyone thinks they are."
Sorry still learning but what does ICE car mean?
Because most people are still buying ICE cars and it suits their needs more than BEV. Hybrids make a lot more sense than BEV from an economical standpoint. More people are attracted to a 700 mile range Corolla hybrid than a Model 3.
"Even when they do try to do an EV, they can be a joke. My wife loves her Mini and was thrilled that they were releasing an EV version this year. She was literally about to press the button on ordering one when she realized the range is only 114 miles! They even advertise it as a second car. She regularly does 100 miles in a day for her job, so that range makes it unworkable for her. I am trying to talk her into a model 3 (I drive a 2016 Model S, and love it!)"
"Because the charging infrastructure is garbage in many areas of the country. Not everyone lives in a city and not all cities have many charging options. We need to develop the grid and continue to make electric cars more affordable. Until there is a large revolution in how the US generates its power and distributes it, electric cars are going to struggle to become the main stream. I dream that we can convert from fossil fuel sources to modern nuclear energy and other environmentally neutral alternatives, but big oil is going to keep that at bay as long as they can. Another thing that truly bothers me is the monopoly Tesla has on their supercharging network. That is not helping promote widespread adoption of EVs. Tesla is in a position where they can develop superchargers far faster than what most municipalities are willing to do. If they truly want to be the good guys in this equation they should let everyone use it."
"See this is where I see electric fitting. I have a couple of other concerns but range is my biggest. I love my truck and the utility it provides me. I need the range and I even have Jerry Cans so that I can get way back in the hollar once I get to the property. However, as soon as a secondary market gets solidly established most people should move to electric. Will it be Tesla? I don't know but people should naturally move over."
Just because a company may be misaligned with overall economy scale trends doesn’t mean it’s mistaken in continuing to do its thing. Their entire apparatus is built around one thing.
"The main problem is that not everyone can just buy one, even if they had the money. The infrastructure just isn't here yet.

I have to drive 25km to the nearest supercharger, and 3km to the nearest petrol station. It's not that large of a problem for me, but for the next person, who has to drive 30km, and the one after that, who has to drive 40. So on, and so forth."
Because not every small car is dedicated to East Atlanta?
Because people buy them.
The other companies still release them because people still buy them.
Development pipelines are long and expensive. If a company is gonna make something new model it's bit gonna be overnight
Because they are not as delusional as you are.
"Um... Tesla's power is in their software, less the fact that the car is electric.  I understand that it allows certain functionality but if an ICE maker would have capitalized on tech I would have bought that instead of an electric car anyday. Probably still would. Electric still has a long way go to for most drivers (10-15 years). 

Consumers (as a majority) don't switch because one day something may be better, you switch when it actually is and 90% of consumers cannot function with only electric. There's no way I wouldn't have a gas car for trips and such at this time. I have at LEAST two more gas purchases before turning my 2nd car to electric."
"The demand isn’t there. Say what you will about how crazy popular the Model 3 is, but if you’ve ever talked to non-tech savvy people they go out of their way to shit all over electric vehicles.

Most of them won’t touch an EV with a ten foot pole."
Until the infrastructure is put in place where people can go charge easily there will be ICE cars.  People travel across state lines everyday. Mapping your route so you can get to a charge station isn’t ideal.
Lol what a dumbass way to think
"So answer me this: do you have any idea what it takes to bridge the gap between what they've done for generations and setting up an entirely new production dynamics, largely new supply chain, new R&D, refitting all production facilities, then scaling up along with quality assurance, failure modes analysis, hell everything you can think of that is involved in fundamentally changing an entire business of a multibillion-dollar, multi-million unit global manufacturer?

But yeah, chortle about them not doing it in a year when Wall Street bullshit hypes Tesla stock as they ride everything into exaggerated proportions. The most popular cars in the US are SUVs, the rogue-size not the Murano size, for reference. Also, have you seen an average American, especially in Atlanta? How is their ass going to fit inside a compact little car? Yes, the Tesla model is the future, but it takes a lot of time to transition to it."
"Frankly putting a  percent of your engineers and marketing for ice cars is a great move, but they should not be putting research into ice and should have layed off most of their ice engine scientists.

As for why companies are still making them, chargers still aren't as universal as petrol stations, especially in rural areas, and forget about outside usa/Europe. 

Now i know the point you are making and I'm going to be downvoted in the tesla sub, but like while buying ice cars in California/urban areas is a no brainer, people without garage charging, in rural areas aren't completely sold on electric RIGHT NOW. Obviously in 5years i think all of the usa will be covered to the extent where buying electric will be a no brainer but 3rd world doesnt have a genius billionaire driving change forward. So that will take time, especially considering majority of the cars sold here are in the range of 5k usd-10k usd. Infact cars started having abs and air bags as standard just 3-4 years ago. Earlier these cars used to get 0 safety rating."
"Hint: it isn’t easy to make ev’s profitably. Elon Musk not only figured it out, but he’s going to put everyone out of business. Remember just because Elon can do it doesn’t mean it’s easy. It’s like asking NASA why they don’t build rockets that land themselves."
"Larger cars are not feasible for most European countries. We don’t have the same luxury of space and Americans do, as a result, our roads and parking spaces are narrower. Perhaps other companies are thinking more about the global market when releasing compact cars."
EAV needs to commit to mopeds or golf carts like peachtree city
"On top of every other reason that's been mentioned, most power grids can't handle the 5:00 pull from people getting off work and plugging their cars in. There's still a lot of things that we don't have solutions to yet."
Because people buy them?
"Because of cost.

Those smaller compacts are affordable for most of America, a price point EVs haven’t be able to break yet."
Gizmodo had an article saying GMC is bring the Hummer back...as an electric off road pickup truck. I think thats great and can't help feeling it's like the stepfather moved into the house and fucked with the old man's garage. It's beautiful.
"This is a foolish sentiment. The Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla are some of the best selling cars in the country, and they're much much cheaper and much more practical than most electric cars.

the technology simply isn't there for the mass market 20 to $25,000 midsize sedan yet. Not everyone has $50,000 to spend on a car like the average model 3 owner does."
Battery’s just don’t hold the same capacity in cold climates. ICE will remain until batteries can store more energy or they fix that issue.
"Dude I literally just bought a 2019 compact with turbo 4....... it’s all about what’s practical for the consumers, if I lived and worked in the same area and only drove maybe  a couple thousand miles a year I’m sure an EV would be great but since January 2019 when I bought the car I’ve put 27,163 miles on it......

Now let’s look at the range and charge time.... for practicality purposes we will say I drove 350 miles between charges and I completely charged the car anytime i hit the super charge station:

27,163/350=77 charges * 75 min full charge time= 97 hours worth of charging in a year....... I spend too much time in my car as it is and that’s driving, now I would have to spend an additional 4 days in the car just sitting there? No thanks....


Once they come a little further and it’s not a chore for someone like me to own one I would be all about it but right now I’ll keep my compact 4 banger thanks"
"Cheap electrics don't have enough range. The most reasonable 300mi range Tesla costs $30k. After you're free supercharging expires it costs $8 0  ( actually 15 see edit) to ""fill up"" and takes an hour at least.

Low ground clearance and no reliability history.

These are the reasons why I got a used crosstrek (subaru compact 4 banger) after my jeep died.

I wanted a Tesla tbh...

[EDIT] $80 is grossly overstating. In SD it's about 15c per kwh making it $15 to ""fill up"""
"Infrastructure needs to be built up too. With current charging times, you need WAY more public charging spots. Not everyone has a house with their personal plug."
Do we even have enough lithium for that?
Because there is not the infrastructure to refill them. Nor are current offerings equal when it comes to cost or range.
"Considering the amount of trucks that Ford, gm, ram, Toyota, and Nissan sell, I think they are doing just fine.

As a truck owner the cost of gas is so stupid cheap, why would I pay more for an electric truck if they offered it? Not saying we shouldn't be moving towards it but I don't think the big companies are worried right now."
"In addition to other reasons people already stated. 

Apartments. 

A lot of people can’t charge their cars at home, which is a big reason why electrics are cheap and convenient. 

Going to a station to charge for 15-30 minutes is a pain and the gas savings gets severely diminished."
Because compact cars with four bangers can be made cheaply and some cheaply which for a lot of people is their primary concern when buying a car.
Yeah... those idiots!!!!! Anyone got a 3 block long extension cord?
Because the majority of America does not have the money to set up capabilities for charging a vehicle every day.  Most people don’t have garages or power set up for this or they live in apartments or rentals. Something like a Tesla is still a rich mans ride.
"Funny you say that, actually.  I recently bought an ICE compact hatchback that I drive around east Atlanta.

The simple fact of the matter is that unless you own a house, owning an electric car is a pain in the ass right now.  I can fill up my tank in a minute flat.  I don't have time to drive to a charger and wait around, and I certainly can't install one at a property I don't own.

Once the charging infrastructure is ubiquitous, I think the ICE will die.  I hope that we, and I, are in a position such that my next vehicle is an electric."
I love the future of Full Electric vehicles but yea I go on many many roadtrips around the US and a couple times into Canada and one time even Northern Canada. Getting a Tesla right now wouldnt be worth it for me. Stopping for 30-60 minutes to charge is appealing to take time to relax and eat but it isn’t practical. Been keeping my eye on Tesla and the EV Charging network and I hope in the near future It will be practical for me to get one. Cause Tesla cars are fucking amazing.
"The honest answer is they can't compete so they try to dismiss EVS.

Problem is, every time a person test drives an EV, they lose a customer."
It's laughable that you think the infrastructure exists so switch to 100% electric vehicles next year.
"Because it's still not an affordable solution for most, and as such the infrastructure across many countries and areas are completely unviable for using an electric car day to day.

Plus for long haul work ice are still more efficent. Having to carry the full weight of your energy source the entire distance is rather inefficeny (and why we won't have electric planes any time soon)"
"I am sure you could find one but I attended CES this year. Eyes on, hands on, and thorough questioning of each vendors offerings."
"Can't tell if this is sarcasm but whatever

The Sony car was nothing but a concept. It was meant to showcase to potential partners that Sony is ready to get into the auto industry by selling them the parts for cars, not making cars themselves"
lol
"Not being sold :P

Just a demonstrator for the other tech they produce such as screens and more."
OOh just wait till the Nintendo u-dieTesla reveal next week!
They have an electric car decked with Sony electronics. That doesn’t mean it is ready to compete.
"Clearly you didn’t actually read the article, bc it stated they aren’t getting into the car market"
"Let’s pretend that despite what everyone else is saying about them not actually making cars, you’re actually right.

Remember when Tesla was learning how to best produce electric cars and had all kinds of defects and production bottle necks? Remember how Rivian has taken 6 years since showing it’s concept car and still doesn’t have a product on market?

Sony still has to go through all that.
So, assuming the car behaves just like it’s advertised to be (which early concepts almost never do) yeah, maybe there will be some competition in 10 years or so from Sony. Assuming they have a good price point and their car doesn’t cost 100k or something.

Even when this happens, it’s not a Tesla killer, it’s a Tesla matcher. Nothing mentioned by Sony seems to be any better than Tesla specs.

Mark my words, by the time Sony comes out with its first model, Tesla and many traditional car companies will have already released several new models."
Is it actually Sony or are just the guts Sony?

No but he can spend more of his money because he can leverage this increased value against the odds of losing that other money.

"You mean the republican new energy vehicle loan which was to help boost fuel efficiency and improve air quality? yeah what a horrible program. 

Also you can’t call a loan a subsidy since it has to be paid back plus interest. 

Where is the criticism of other manufacturers which got a loan like ford who sooo obviously used it as a handout instead of any real effort to make new energy vehicles.

Lets compare

Tesla got around $480 million loan and it helped make the Model S which won car of the decade and sold around 260k since 2012 worldwide.

Ford got $5.6 billion and they made what? Ford focus electric?! That car didn’t win anything and only sold 10k since 2012.

If you divide loan against number of cars made in that program that is $1,846 per model S and $560,000 per Ford Focus Electric."

"They do make the batteries. What they don't make (yet?) is the cells. Panasonic makes the cells, then Tesla makes the battery (wiring, packaging, cooling and the software to manage the thing).
The definition of battery is ""two or more cells put together"".

It's sold a whopping 130 (not a typo: one hundred and thirty) cars in the US. Nobody right now is even close to Tesla from seven years ago.

"Most people need affordable cars, but relatively few need affordable new cars."
"No, that's quite wrong. It's more that automakers have a combined multi-trillion ICE supply chain that is *extremely* difficult to transition into a full EV stack. Doing so would put hundreds if not thousands of suppliers the world over out of business. Tesla has none of those issues and they are led by the man who started and oversees SpaceX, which is the most valuable rocket company on the planet.

The cars being cheap to consumers is a consequence, an excuse; not the actual reason."
[deleted]
">  and establishing supply chains.

This is the big one. If you're going to sell ten million cars you're going to need *seventy billion* batteries... that supply chain will easily take 10-20 years to establish.

Gigafactory was announced over 6 years ago and billions of dollars later still only produces enough for what, a half million cars?

The world needs 50+ gigafactory-scale battery plants just to make the switch, and so far (outside of Tesla) there are only plans to build a few.

The moat remains."
They are still making them because people are still buying them.
"Hyundai released the Kona with an BEV option. They showed that you can design a car for ICE and then rip that gassy boy out and slap in a shit ton of Duracells and have a functional automobile.   So minimal R&D and factory retooling. 

Although seeing some of the responses here, I guess there would have to be a HUGE change to the supply chain to get the requisite number of batteries."
"It's also because tesla has to fight for every sale and every car is a risk, electric is growing but still not massive so it forces tesla to innovate, they don't have anything to fall back on if sales dip so they have to adapt and this means they are always on the cutting edge and always leading its what makes them so attractive.

It also helps tesla seem to open themselves up to upgrades and keeping cars running longer, my Hope is when battery tech gets better they offer the abilty to upgrade to that new tech even after you have the car, so you can just roll your stock model 3 in and swap out for the upgrade for a fee, it keeps people who might have just gotten a different car in the tesla and keeps Money coming in, it's how you can add in the full self driving later, it let's people get the car cheaper today and upgrade tommorow when they can afford it,"
"Imagine having to pay dividends while funding R&D and firing 10k employees for which you'll have to pay pensions or compensation packages.

"Don’t most/all of them already have one or two electric vehicles? But they suck? So instead of furthering development for that battery, they choose to invest engineering and time into the wrong sector: internal combustion horsepower."
"This is exactly it. The old car companies are burdened with old liabilities, and don't stand a chance against the new tech companies"
This is just silly.
"And I'll buy one.

"They all laughed at him as well.  They knew what he was doing, they just didn’t give a shit when they really should of.  Flashbacks of blockbuster not paying attention to a little company called Netflix."
Not to mention the infrastructure for charging. I don’t think we’ll see mass adoption until it gets to the point of at least 1 charger per 4 pumps
"They have the resources. The Model S is ten years old by now. They can back engineer pony cars and pick up in less than a year but this is out of reach? Nah. 

Changing over would mean a total rework of the supply chain and that will piss off many, many rich people heavily invested in these industries. Think kf how much less steel is used in the powertrain alone. To switch is to cut into the profits of established companies and rich dudes and shift it elsewhere. 

They're dragging ass on purpose, research the GM EV1 fiasco and try to tell me they aren't trying to kill the EV"
"Also, they don‘t have the talent or the ability to attract talent."
Since when do volkswagen and toyota not have resources?
GM made $150 billion last year
They could afford it. Every company ever that has had to adapt and succeeded has done it. This is mk different. They just don't want to
"It took 7 years to build the bulk of our gas station network.

If someone wanted to spend the two billion required, we'd have a sc network that could handle every car on the road by the end of the year."
Probably more like 10-20 years. It will take that long for EV marketshare to hit 25% of all vehicles sold.
"If only we had fuel for electric vehicles pumped into every home and business in the nation.  There would be no excuses!

I propose we set up centralized power plants on some kind of “grid” of electric wires connecting most of the places where cars are parked at night and during the day.  

“Lack of infrastructure” is the most preposterous argument against EVs in 2020."
"There is a gas station on every corner.  Turn them all into ""super"" chargers."
Tesla is aiming for that in 2021
"Do you live in 2012? If so, welcome to 2020 where we have $37,000 electric cars with sports car performance."
"Most metropolitan areas don’t work either, because you’re not going to have reliable charging at home overnight.  This goes double for basically all major cities where you’re fighting for street parking.  EVs are for the people in the suburbs who live in apartments with dedicated parking lots and management amenable to installing chargers, or single family homes with a driveway."

Model 3 is the perfect fit for her.
"The grid needs upgrades for accommodating renewable sources, but it can handle BEVs just fine already.

Just a matter of getting the actual charge points standardized and deployed."
"Spoken like someone who doesn't have an EV.  Many areas of the country don't have electricity in the home?  Wtf are you talking about?  90%+ of charging is done at the home.  I think I've used a supercharger twice in the last year, and I have one less than a mile from my house."
"People that don't live in the city are more likely to have a garage/carport to park their car in while it charges.  It's literally that simple, just plug it in overnight and wake up to a ""full tank"".  The Tesla supercharger network exists because Tesla put in the work to build it.   It's not their problem other carmakers can't be half-assed to build their own.  Quit this bullshit about them ""not helping the widespread adoption of EVs"".   Without them none of this would have happened at all."
"That’s not the whole story. 90%++ of the US population lives in areas with potential for excellent charging, and the rural areas have easy access for home charging. Charging is only problematic for a small, small fraction of our *total* population."
"Tesla does offer to license their super charger network, no other manufacturer has been willing to take them up on it."
"This is ridiculous, there is electricity literally everywhere surrounding people really anytime they are near a structure. How hard is it to install 220v and a sub panel? A couple thousand dollars? Certainly an order of magnitude simpler than installing a gas pump.

I find the argument about super chargers ironic. Please direct your disdain for a lack of a universal charging standard to the rest of the automotive industry. My friend was an engineer at Tesla back when they were designing the charger. SAE, and the rest of the automotive industry completely stonewalled Tesla’s technology requests for specs on charging standards. “No one is asking for that” the response from the SAE said, when Tesla was requesting DC fast charging into the spec. The rest of the industry didn’t want to improve past a 4-hour charge time. The SAE charging standard took 10 years to finalize, looks like an undergraduate’s capstone project, and can be unplugged by a random stranger walking by your car."
"If you can afford a Tesla you can afford a home charger

In the Triad NC we have an abundance of superchargers. Literally every Sheetz gas station has them (Probably because they're right off major interstates)"
Sounds like you're full of it. $28 at most if doing 100kwh.
"> Stopping for 30-60 minutes to charge is appealing to take time to relax and eat, but it isn’t practical. 

At 320 miles of highway range in a Model S, this means you’ll stop to charge every five hours (assuming an *average* speed of 65-70 mph). How many hours of range would you prefer?

I hate driving more than ten hours in a day. After ten hours, I’m ready to lay down and put on a movie. As such, five hours of highway range seems perfect to me."
"I did a 2600km trip this time last year and stopping about every 2-3 hours for a stretch and toilet break (didn't have to refuel the car) was just about right, and highway service stations were conveniently located about this far apart.  There's no real reason you couldn't stop every couple of hours, plug your car in and go to the toilet.

I found out later that if I'd been driving a Tesla I could have done the same trip in about the same time because there were Superchargers conveniently located."
you're funny. what about the fact that you're paying out the ass for gas? i think it cost me like 100 bucks to drive from mass to virginia. i could've flown for less.
I only saw that wacky Avatar vehicle in online coverage. What else stood out to you?

"Exactly right. They have no plans to produce a car. I'd love to see them get into the space, but they are more interested in supplying components. That's still a win, but even if their offerings are easily integrated, it's not a complete product and getting *any* of those parts into production cars is still years away."

"Ford made significant investments in hybrid tech.  It also sells millions of cars per year. Tesla was a baby mfgr at the time. That said, Ford should have been allowed to fail.

"I don’t think they will be a software or robotaxi company. Software is not their product, it’s a tool they use to get to their goals. Robotaxi may be a subset of their car hobby."
Tesla started as a car company and that is still where they get the vast majority of their income. It's foolish to call them anything else
"Phones are computers, but they're not PCs. Apple is still primarily a PC company (where ""PC"" is ""personal computer"", not ""Windows"" in this case)."

Meanwhile they represent over half of the worlds Lithium ion battery production.
"Yes they do, but there’s going to be a lot of money to be made selling batteries in the coming years. If you have the best and most scaleable processes that are the best value, that means something. The company has more potential than cars."
I do agree. It’s the application of tech to manufacturing and energy. I absolutely love the combination. There’s this pace of innovation that the that manufacturing industry has been missing since the 60’s. What I love most about this is the application to aerospace.

"Cells are also considered batteries. They're called ""batteries"" because the earliest batteries were comprised of multiple cells, but these days the term ""battery"" means single cells. So it's still fair to say that Tesla doesn't make their own batteries. They make *battery packs*."
If ever. Why even bother with an IPO unless he just wants to dump his shares and do something else.
"Yeah but when will tesla come out with a ""corolla killer"" exactly, never"
It hasn’t even launched yet and you’re saying to “ get over it”. That’s rich. Ford hasn’t been in the electric game yet and they’re not jumping in light. They gave it the mustang name and they know the stakes. If you want to talk about learning from history and you’re talking cars then you’re talking learning from ford. That’s how it’s always been. Look at all the firsts over the years.If history has taught anything it’s not to write off ford before their model drops. Don’t you find it odd that the Tesla truck went up against a two wheel drive f150 with the smallest power plant available instead of four wheel drive f150 or an f250 or 350 or 450? Tesla only wanted a piece of the smallest two wheel drive model. Sad!
"The Mach e is not a hybrid. It’s an all electric mustang and it’s got a 300 mile range and a sticker of $45-$60,000. When it drops next year it’s going to take a big chunk of Tesla sales."

That's the opposite of greedy.

I'm sure you get some rotten billionaires, but he's not one of them. He even wants a backup of human life on Mars so we don't go extinct. And FWIW, Teslas give tons of joy to anyone who owns one. Please consider a test drive and you never know, your bitterness may subside!"

Where do you charge it for one?  You’re not running an extension cord out the window of a 10th story apartment to your vehicle parked on the street.
"No one is saying you can’t. But if you think that’s something that can come into fruition soon, you’re wrong. The shift to majority EV is going to involve cooperation between many many thousands of companies to make the transition from gas."
"This is so underappreciated. People really think that big OEMs, just because they are big, have an easy time scaling up production faster than tesla. They will have such a slow ramp while their ICE sales decline way faster due to battery manufacturing being a constraint."
True but they need to start making changes NOW. Adapt to survive.
"The supply chain is definitely the biggest inhibitor, but ineffective culture is what has really let Tesla in the door. 

The automotive industry has spent the last decade and a half dissuading Silicon Valley money and culture from getting into the automotive business. 

Applying a fail-early/fail-fast approach to cars was laughed at (and still is). But Tesla is moving SO much faster in the EV space than anyone else (against greater volume and less and less logistical nightmares). 

Even with Ford and GM throwing tons of money and bringing far more mature logistics to the party, the gap in batteries, software, and risk-acceptance for the sake of lowering cost (see Cybertruck) is so large.  Hard imagining they won’t reach a golden state level of financial and logistical stability in the EV space years before anyone else. 

Obviously, the insertion of Amazon (the greatest logistical company on the planet) is big. And auto makers will assuredly turn to Microsoft, Google, etc. for first party help in closing the gap in software. But, I’ll be curious to see how many meaningful investments/efforts we’ll see (of the continued variety) when the ROI and profit margins are mostly awful in this space. 

All that said, I really like Toyota’s approach. I will probably bet that they end up the overall EV-kings. The infrastructure, culture, supply chain, stability, etc. is too good. It will apply to EV, eventually. Elon just needs Tesla to be stable, not the largest. Space-X is the one where being the biggest matters."
"Yer I know a few people here in the UK that have model 3s and a model X and they love them but they dread issues because its a stupid wait time for parts, being called the apple of cars is cool but telsa don't want to be know for the part of apple that forces people to wait weeks for the most basic part, it's the one thing I worry about with the cyber trunk, you need parts in stock ready to go, not 1 week back order because if that's the case people won't buy them, if I'm using my cybertrunk and my main work horse in a farm or ranch or whatever and it goes down I'm gonna want it fixed fast, if I take it in and they say ""yer 3 weeks for the part"" I'm gonna sell it and a buy an f150 just because its common, its a working truck so tesla need the infrastructure to back that life style up."
"Great point.
But besides that it is the suppliers and vendors who is killing the innovation. No company is making entire (almost) car on its own except Tesla. This is huge for QC, updates and constant changes. Plus auto suppliers are practically married to car companies and upper management spouces. Hence having no need to innovate rather produced regular production. Tesla seen the hard rime in the start, but the sky are the limits for them and they are reaching it."
"I think this could be doable if everyone putted their efforts together in making EV's. But, at this moment and the way the industry is shaped (specially the auto industry), this is just not a reality. I think big companies will need to shift their mentality or be forced to, so they can meet the goal to transition for a sustainable future (including efforts for a more sustainable production of batteries - cobalt and lithium - threw funding new technologies and research-  such as Solid State Batteries)"
This makes me realize the amount of batteries the human race would constantly go through if every car on the road today was electric... It feels impossible to achieve.
Gigafactory is producing for cars AND powerwalls.
"This is so underappreciated. People really think that big OEMs, just because they are big, have an easy time scaling up production faster than tesla. They will have such a slow ramp while their ICE sales decline way faster due to battery manufacturing being a constraint."
"Not to forget batteries require lithium which is not that abundant. Batteries are already inflating Tesla price, imagine if all car needed them."
Elon said a few years ago that with three or four more Gigafactories he could power the world. From what I understand he’s only made one more. I hope someone has more info than I do about this. But it seems possible.

"I wish people would realize the absolute red herring that electric cars are as an environmental fix. Totally switching onto an entirely different system just requires way too many resources, material and intellectual, that would be much better spent on public transportation. Tesla has undoubtedly done an incredible amount of harm to the fight against climate change by making electric seem like a reasonable path."

Because they haven't released a comparative ev substitute for the same cost.
"I have driven the kona ev. Its great for an ""economy"" crossover. They have the same drivetrain for the 2020 soul ev.

Its their common platform and I foresee it being used in swaps for fwd drivetrains"
">'s also because tesla has to fight for every sale and every car is a risk, electric is growing but still not massive so it forces tesla to innovate, they don't have anything to fall back on if sales dip so they have to adapt and this means they are always on the cutting edge and always leading its what makes them so attractive.  
>  
>It also helps tesla seem to open themselves up to upgrades and keeping cars running longer, my Hope is when battery tech gets better they offer the abilty to upgrade to that new tech even after you have the car, so you can just roll your stock model 3 in and swap out for the upgrade for a fee, it keeps people who might have just gotten a different car in the tesla and keeps Money coming in, it's how you can add in the full self driving later, it let's people get the car cheaper today and upgrade tommorow when they can afford it,

I seriously doubt this - I think the wear and tear on the interior will make this cost prohibitive where the current batteries on the Model 3 with 75kwh pack are already expected to get 300,000+ miles (1500 discharge cycles) before 20% degradation (max charge range would be an approx EPA mileage of 248 dropped from 310)"
Why fire and hire 10000k people instead of re train existing people?
"Lol you are parroting ""disruption"". These are huge companies that can't turn on a dime but they can buy all the agile companies up if they wanted. Then, they can incorporate their innovation into their business plans."
"Yes, because going from a horse to a ICE car is a huge upgrade. While going from ICE cars to electric cars isnt really that much of an upgrade, I mean the only thing that EV offer is great acceleration, which you can easily get from a motorcycle, and cheap but inconvenient charging. There isnt that much of an incentive to switch ATM, the only charging station near me at all is at the mall, which is always packed."
Instead they spend 2.5 trillion on the American military over the past two years.
"Not only a massive supercharger network, but every house in the country and every apartment building would need electrical upgrades to handle charging a car(s). There are in excess of 120 million housing units in the US alone that would need an electrical upgrade. At just $1,000 each, which is likely conservative given how much infrastructure would have to be built out for apartments and such, it would cost in excess of $120 billion to just get everyone an upgraded plug so they could charge their car(s) at night. We have a long way to go before EVs will be the only thing we drive. Roll that out worldwide and you're talking in the trillions of dollars.

Electricians have a very bright future."
It's also infinitely easier to build a gas station somewhere as you don't need to first run heavy wiring over there and put in a multi million dollar transformer just to have enough power available for the multi million dollar charging stations.
"Except for people who live in apartments without ability to install charging ports, and work at businesses that don't have charging ports... It may not be the biggest hurdle but there are still infrastructure issues to consider"
"Your comment just shows ignorance of the entire topic.

You do realize that a large scale push to electric would destroy our energy grid right? And that energy grid also heats your house, and pumps the water to it.

Infrastructure isn't just the end points that you see"
"You realize that there are limits to the power grid right? You can't just increase the usage by high double digit percentages an not have significant impacts without significant upgrades.

If you make a pie chart of the entire usage of energy for transportation right now, a huge percentage of it will be gasoline for cars. If you cut that out, the grid has to come up with that shortcoming and somehow handle the increased load."
"Read up on the green paradox.

  


If we significantly reduce our oil consumption, oil companies aren't going to stop selling it. Instead, the falling oil prices will cause them to extract and sell more, which causes a higher total co2 output.

  


Essentially, we need the whole world to reduce fossil fuel consumption. Any other case would quicken global warming."
"Our energy grid isn't even close to being able to accommodate that. You know a car takes more energy than a house, right?  We'd have to, quite literally, triple the energy grid's capacity."
"This requires an incredible amount of work done to support all of that electrical demand. I don’t think people understand the load demand that would be needed to support this. Something around 2% of all registered cars are electric in the US. The US sold 17 million new vehicles in 2018, of those, around 360,000 were electric sales. To replace so many new sales with electric would require insane amounts of electric demand. Turning gas stations into super chargers also ignores the tens of millions more older cars that people can’t afford to upgrade. It’s gonna be a while for electric but thankfully we’re making good progress. ICE is still very profitable for manufactures and that’s why they’re still making them."
"so far i have only heard of the model Y and Cybertruck neither of which is going to be significantly cheaper.

Is there something else announced for under 20k at this point?"
You think Tesla is making anything off of that 37k car?
"In my country not many people can afford $37,000 car, performance or not."
With decent profit margins too
"Let's be real - only few percent of the richest people on the planet can afford to spend 37k on a new car.

As long as ICE cars are cheaper (to both build *and* maintain), they will sell well."
How many people can realistically afford a 37000 $ car?
The Tesla Model 3 at 37k is not gonna give you sports car performance. There's more to performance than a fast 0-60... Jesus you live in a bubble or some shit.
"A model that makes them hardly any profit, has barely any range, and is still twice as much as compact cars and 15 grand more than standard sedan base models. People need cheap. EV isn’t cheap yet even talking about gas savings."
"Norway is a far smaller country that had money to spend on infrastructure. The US is really, really big, and making all of that work for electric vehicles will take a long long time, maybe by 2050, but definitely not this decade"
"Dude you and Norway. Norway isn’t even as remotely close to large as the US. Stop using a small country as a comparison marker to one of the largest, most spread out countries on planet earth."
"You mean a tiny country with a small, concentrated population which has trillions in oil money from which they can draw to invest into infrastructure?

As it happens, most other countries are not in such a good position."
Lol. Which Union has a say in what new cars are manufactured?
Comparing a used model 3 to a new car isn’t really apples to apples. A used ICE would be even cheaper. Also a lightly used model 3 SR won’t have 200 mile range when you charge to 90%. And if you want to take TCO into account you have to talk about insurance. Insurance for my model 3 is twice that of another car. All my gas savings go to insurance.
">""How can I afford a gas car over a lightly used Model 3?""

simple, the cheapest used model 3 available in my region right now costs 52,230€

I have owned my car for 8 years now and including absolutely all costs including a broken transmission, new tires, fuel, insurances simply **everything** brings the total cost of owning this car to just below 32,000€

i couldnt even afford a base model for this and i would still have to charge the Tesla and still have maintenance on parts that wear over time.

The model 3 is not even close to competing with the TCO of compacts ICE´s which sell in the millions each year."
I’d like to see your figures. Have you seen what a used Tesla goes for these days? TCO of a reliable used ICE car is still much less expensive and far more convenient for most.
Not every person can charge everyday and range anxiety is real. I have a LR AWD and on a full 90% charge I get 260 miles now. I have to charge every three days or I run the risk of damaging the battery if something comes up and I have a longer then expected drive. Just the other day I needed to go somewhere and realized that my car didn’t have enough charge. I couldn’t just drive to a gas station and get all that range in 5 min. If I didn’t have an ICE car for backup I would have had to wait at home and charge 30 miles an hour or drive to a supercharger and hope there is an open stall and charge for 30 min minimum. What if I didn’t live five miles from a super charger what do i do then? Range and ability to replenish it quickly and conveniently is real. People always talk about stats where people only drive 50 miles a day. What if I live in an apartment can’t charge every night and haven’t charged in a few days go to work and after work unexpectedly I gave to go out with friends can I just quickly refill up?
"....Which is capex, not an income statement item."
More people can’t afford to pay a giant stack of cash for a model 3 that they can’t charge at their apartment
Do you live in a tiny European country where everyone has chargers and nobody ever has to road trip anywhere or are you just a moron?
"A Corolla Hybrid is more sensible to them. Also, BEVs don't save the planet by any complete measure."
What a shitty take.
Sounds more like you are talking about yourself. Step out of your bubble and experience the rest of the world.
but its also over 10k more expensive.
I mean california has blackouts regularly. Guess thats fine though
"No, no it can't."
"I think he’s talking about high-rise condos and apartments. But most of those people are riding subways and walking to work, so the argument holds as much water as a wiffle ball.  The people who live in downtown condos are doing so to be close to work, so they don’t have a long commute anyway. They can charge once a month at a public charger in the exact same way and frequency as they already use a gas station. Like a said, wiffle ball argument."
... So what if you live in an apartment?
[deleted]
"Yeah that works for people with homes not apartments and condos which most people who live in cities have. Until it becomes common place for apartments and condos to have chargers that’s just not an option for many people. Also, I’m sorry, I didn’t realize the solution was to create brand specific chargers accross the country. I guess ICE car makers should be doing that with gasoline as well. It just doesn’t make economical sense to do that. Tesla has struggled for so long to make a profit, and you think other succesful car makers are going to follow in those foot steps? If anything this argument makes it seem like electric cars may not be the solution for the future if the infrastructure is going to be that fragmented and difficult to establish."
"Okay, but many people don’t have access to home charging because they live in apartments and condos that do not have infrastructure on site. I live in one of the top 10 most populous cities in the US and none of the apartments around here have ev support. Additionally despite working for a large company there is no charging there either. I get that I can go drive to a charger in my free time just like I do for gas but the difference is having to sit there for 20 to 30 minutes versus 5 minutes. This is something I’d be willing to do for a 25k or less car but not for something as expensive as a Tesla. That being said if I could afford a Model 3 I’d probably own a house. The price point of good EVs is simply too high for many people to leave their preferred ICE cars behind especially at the cost of convenience."
In the US...
Power transmission infrastructure needs to be taken into account. It is not currently prepared for everyone to charge their car.
"Right and that supply of electricity is infinite? Buildings have an allowance on how much they are allowed to draw from the grid. Yes it's easy to add a couple of chargers, but if you want to support a city comprised of primarily electric cars that is a different story. If every company needs a different charger than that gets super difficult. I appreciate what Tesla has done to help get more mainstream EVs and to show to the world that EVs are very practical, but there is still a lot in the way. I'm not saying it's impossible I'm just saying it's not happening tomorrow."
You don't need a home charger.  A Tesla can plug into existing outlets in homes / garages.
"Not everybody can put up a charger, especially in Europe where there is not much space for individual ones and often you can't just put a cable across the street"
"You're right, my friend gave me the number and I didn't fact check until u called me out. I'll edit my post to prevent more misinformation."
"Yea and I agree with that but i go with another person so we just take turns nonstop* driving for sometimes over 24h at a time and instead of having 10-15 bathroom/snack resupply/fast food stops, stretching those for 30-60 minutes in the long run would just add too much time"
Im not saying it’s cheaper. I’m talking about the practicality of it. Sorry if I didnt make that clear
"Tech wise not much. 

Holistically though, everyone seems to be designing the AI using internal software teams. 

I fear great setbacks to the industry and progression of level 4 and 5 if we don’t start forming clear and consistent regulation from deep simulation and modeling of proposed systems. Let’s avoid a 737 Max type issue in self driving cars."
">How can people think I'm serious?

Because Sony had a compelling car with nice features. And because Sony is a massive and we'll known brand that is not just something out of Kickstarter. I'd love to see that car produced."
"Yup, TBH Its quiet a shame, It looked pretty nice, Don't know how it would drive.

But they would stand a better chance in the market than certain current ICE makers"

"Things aren’t going to get better in a few years. It’s going to take a lot longer. And his success with tesla is more helpful than you apparently think. Not only with his success with tesla but that success inspired competition, therefore other electric cars, there for a larger market of electric cars and less for gas. Revolutions aren’t immediate.

"Hmm...ok. I see how that could upset someone. However, from some people point of view unions have too much power and perhaps shelter those whom simply don't like to work? Perhaps Musk has found a happy median or is striving towards it. Union busting asshole is harsh. At the moment his company has barely been profitable in its lifetime. Once it's profitable I hope he's able to find the happy median his employees deserve, whilst not having a union to shelter lazy ass workers."
It’s damn near a personality cult.
I'm with the other guy. It might be true that billionaires shouldn't exist but the fact is that they do exist and the silver lining of that setup is that sometimes it ends up in the hands of people like Elon who put their lives and everything they own into changing the world for the better.
"Someone who creates thousands of jobs and drives the world forward in terms of technology and climate change deserves ""billions"" imo. I say ""billions"" because it's his stock value. He doesn't have billions in liquid cash."

"Why do people talk about charitable donations like it’s some genius way to save money?

If you earn $10 million and have an effective tax rate of 20% then you’d pay $2 million in tax. You’re left with $8 million. 

If you earn $10 million and donate $1 million then it means you only pay the tax on the $9 million which is $1.8 million. Leaving you with $7.2 million. 

So yeah you’re paying $200k less tax but you had to give away $1 million to do it."

I am pretty sure they would be left in space and used to manufacture space craft etc. It's pretty expensive to get that stuff up there. So why bring it down?
I based it on Tesla achieving $1T valuation so starting point was $89B

Soros seems pretty cool.
I'm pointing out what every article about this is saying. Ford decades ago was worth more than Tesla today when adjusted for inflation.
lol that doesn't mean you can just ignore inflation

His previous divorces didn't really cost him that much. I think he did it smartly the last times..
"I'm not so sure. Tesla is supply constrained. Packaging batteries is a manufacturing problem. It's not a problem involving lack of raw materials or expense of manufacturing. With more and bigger factories there's no reason why Tesla can't make cars at the same price point as a Corolla. At that point nobody will buy Corollas unless you really have no place where you can charge -- a substantial fraction of people to be sure, but less than half of the entire market. A Tesla is so much better than a Corolla that it's no contest. Tesla has a credible expansion plan to get there.

Even at present production rates, Tesla is affecting sedan sales. The sedan market is tanking. That's not because people don't want sedans. It's because people don't want ICE sedans. People want Tesla sedans.

So yes, Tesla can absolutely kill Corolla, and Camry, and Accord, and Civic, and all of those. The bull case for Tesla is that they will do exactly that."
Oh yeah let's compare a $100000 Ford truck with a $50000 Tesla truck. What you don't realize is that cars are obsolete. Ford's history with cars means squat. Would you be bragging about horse and buggy manufacturers going up against carmakers just because of their glorious history making horse carriages? Electric vehicles are so much better than ICE cars. The game's over. You just don't realize it yet.
Alright.
">When it drops next year it’s going to take a big chunk of Tesla sales.

Because of the Ford charging network and vastly superior performance?"
"I don’t think they are going to have a large impact on Tesla. Sure they are going to sell some but if I’m spending $45k on an electric car it has to have an infrastructure for charging in place like Tesla. If it’s not slick and easy to use I’m not buying. Yes things like electrify America /plug share exist but because they aren’t controlled by the auto maker they are not as easy to use and find. 

I know that today, the infrastructure to charge and drive across country  exists for Tesla. This is not the case with all other electrics and if these other charging infrastructures are not clear and as easy to use for a car enthusiast what does that say for average buyer. 

If I want electric that bad I’d rather have golf e for $13k used rather than a $45k Ford since neither one have a charging system in place that can even touch Tesla. 

I wanted a rivian but it comes down to price and the ability to drive longer distances when needed with as little hassle as possible.  I wish Rivian would have bought into Tesla’s charging and helped expand it."
"Yeah, maybe. I'm buying both gold and bitcoin. Doesn't change the fact that foreign banks are losing faith in the dollar."
"I think it's a fair claim. One of the goals of SpaceX is to make human life multiplanetary. He wants to do this because he says it is a certainty that human life will become extinct if we stay on this planet, but the odds become very small if we are living on multiple planets."

"If we needed to double global auto production in a couple years, ICE builders could do it. Steel is readily available and machine shops can scale quickly. But batteries? Not so much.

The legacy makers can build everything above the floor relatively quickly and easily, but they are ages behind on the critical part."
"It's not that I think it's easy but that they have had the resources to do it. The fact is the biggest part of the problem is that they are just starting now. It could have been a slow ramp up and they'd be ready if they'd given a shit. Instead they buried their heads in the sand, and atleast in GM's case acticely sabotaged their early EV development. I hope they get left behind."
"Step 1: start

Without that, you'll never get to scale."
"I know people will hate to hear this. 

ICE sales aren’t declining drastically and won’t decline until similarly priced and equipped EV vehicles are available. Most stats just show Tesla being the best selling EV. Well...no shit. Also, Tesla messing with the 3 series and A4 sales. 

Ex) Someone buying a 40k full size SUV can’t compromise and get a base model 3 for 40k"
Totally agree but ten year investments are a tough sell when executives are busy chasing quarterly profits.
No they dont. The late 2000's proved they were *too big to fail*. They will just get another bail out like the banks did.
"Toyota? Are you serious? 

They have been fighting EVs for decades and have squandered what could have been a huge opportunity to take the Prius to full EV.

Toyota is ludicrously conservative and slow. A 2019 Prius C has exactly the same drivetrain and entertainment system as the first 2011 models.

They can't make anything interesting any more. GT86: Subaru. Supra: BMW. If they can't make these simple variations on an ICE car, how do you expect them to make a real EV that is desirable and affordable?"
"Tesla is doing many things right. Two subtle ones are to create long-term mineral contacts for batteries, and to address any issues that stop people from buying electric, like creating a supercharger network when they were still a small company, etc.

Amazingly impressive overall."

The cyber truck isn't marketed as a farm truck , I'm assuming it's the same market the Honda Ridgeline was marketed towards the daily driver that sees some extracurricular activities once in a while."
What do you imagine the product mix is? Power walls have likely only made up 1-3% of total output.
"> lithium which is not that abundant.

This has been drastically overstated. Lithium appeared limited because the demand was limited. Since demand has increased, new deposits have been sought and found. 

There's an estimated 62 million tons of known lithium reserves. A car only uses about 100 pounds of lithium. Just based on the current known reserves, that's enough for 1.2 billion cars.

Even assuming zero recycling and no technology changes, that would cover the global supply of cars for 20 years. Lithium is an element, it's infinitely recyclable."
Source?
"Elon said it would require 100 gigafactories to encompass total global demand. With manufacturing efficiencies not shared with other companies, I think 50+ remains a safe estimate."
I don't think you've done enough research to have a competency on this subject. The experts do not share your conclusion.
Good thing literally nobody is suggesting an overnight switch to electric then.
I would assume most people would charge at night when there is a lull.
"Yeah, that's the main draw back with market economies. Short term profit is the only motivation."
"Its a little of the chicken and the egg argument. 

At the same time if people stopped buying new ICE the industry would change. There isnt necessarily any reason to buy a new ICE vs a used one or people hanging on to their current cars, if they were really only in the market for an EV. Overall i dont think there really is any massive demand for evs. There is demand for teslas. Its just like when the iphone came out and the situation with smartphones in the US. There wasnt some massive demand for smartphones, it was really just demand for iphones."
Because that's impossible.
Hard to train mechanics to write code
I'm just saying people are thinking our ability to change is a lot smaller than it is.
"Operating costs are about 70% less. I think most people would be motivated by that. If you factor in the health costs of gasoline, EVs are closer to 90% cheaper to operate."
Ugh.
"All you need is a 15 amp 240 line run, which is peanuts.  Nowhere near $1000.

Apartments can probably share a reduced number of bigger Chargers.

Plus, $120 billion is what...  20% of the us defence budget?  Let's have this done by 2021.

Canada already requires all new houses have provisions for ev charging in every garage."
"No, instead you have to dig up a huge hole, install a massive tank, put in appropriate anti-leaking measures, pour a huge concrete pad, that isn't allowed to have relief cuts near pumps, due to spills, install top of the line fire suppression, and despite all this, still require environmental remediation of the soil when it closes.  All for a product that's so competitive, you can only have a 2-3% profit margin.

And that comes out in the cost.  A gas station costs $1 million per pump to build.  A supercharger is $50k per stall.

And those transformers aren't millions there bud...   It's just a chunk of iron wrapped in wire, suspended in transformer oil.  $175k will get you 5MW of transformer capacity around here installed, and that's good for 15 stalls.  Most of the time outside of residential areas, there's lots of HV capacity lying around, because the cost of running a higher amperage cable at a higher voltage is so tiny compared to the cost of stringing the cable in the first place."
"Installing chargers is a lot easier than setting up a new gas station. You need to be pretty damn far out of the way to not have easy access to electricity, which a gas station also needs anyways. I dont know why you think transformers cost a million, but even if they did that would still be cheaper than building the storage needed for gas. 
 

Not only is it cheaper to construct, you aren't constantly having to bring in fuel once it's built. Chargers also dont require nearly as much maintenance as pumps. 

And anyways, we all know a good part of the profit for a gas station is the convenience store. Makes even more sense for chargers, where you'll likely be stopped at least 20 minutes and are likely to go grab a bite to wat to pass the time. 

Big charging stations make a ton of financial sense in the long run imo"

"Charging outlets are just fancy electric dryer outlets, not exactly cutting edge technology that are hard or expensive to install.  Thousands are wired up every day.   Electric utilities often subsidize them because they actually help stabilize the load on the grid."
"As much as I love EV's. Not only does it seem most companies are behind but even the cheap cars are still expensive. That's not mentioning that companies still buy new cars and they need vehicles to refill in minutes you can't wait half an hour or an hour for it to charge every so many miles. I'd love to have an EV but if I go to buy one and the ones I can afford have less than 150 miles of range highway I won't be buying one and still stuck with a ICE engine. I travel a lot of just work sometimes, not to mention errands. Great I can leave earlier to sit at a station to charge for 30 minutes, except that I often don't have time between jobs to waste or to run an errand, and most places you park don't have chargers which is worse if you factor in that everyone else would now be driving EV's too."
"Yes, but in the great scheme of things they are trivial to solve. Again look at London (no doubt there are other cities like it.) You simply institute a modest financial incentive for EV use, and everything else follows."

"From recent memory, when oil prices fell drastically, I remember reading that quite a few oil companies (smaller ones) went out of business and existing ones slowed down the rate of new oil exploration since it was not profitable anymore"
"That isn't how it works at all. When prices fall, production is halted or slowed on the most expensive to extract deposits. If America significantly reduced it's purchases of oil, it would definitely not lead to an increase in production."
That's where a carbon tax comes into play.
"Clearly you don’t own an EV or work for an electric utility. My 6.5 year old Tesla Model S P85 barely touched my electric bill. Cars can charge off-peak and actually help stabilize  spikes in demand similar to the function of the giant resisters you see at power plants. 
Your only question should be “does it break the laws of physics?”.  The answer is no.  
We need to modernize the grid anyway."
Quit the petrol company shilling.
"https://cleantechnica.com/2018/02/02/nrel-finds-future-ev-charging-demand-will-require-coordination-utilities-car-owners/

Good point. This report states that our electric grid could handle 25% of all cars sold in a year to be electric if only using level 1 charging. Level 2 would require upgrades."
new battery tech is going to drive down the cost. They're still working on it from the Maxwell acquisition.
"Correct, that’s why they up charge for self driving when it’s already built into the car and software limited.

Have you seen their profit lately? Have you seen their Model S/X sales lately? Where do you think all that profit is coming from? Certainly not S/X sales!
In what world are ICE cars cheaper to maintain? I just spent four-digits on preventative maintenance on a six-cylinder Toyota for parts that a Tesla doesn’t even have.

"If you look at the union negotiated wages/benefits compared to telsa, the big 3 pay out more. It adds to the overall manufacturing cost and R&D.

Many cities don't have public transportation. I live in the city and I'm 9 miles away from work and there is no way to get there without a car. There is no subway system.
There are more apartments in the suburbs than there are downtown. There's a whole spectrum of living options between 'house in the suburbs' and 'downtown condo.'

You can always install your own infrastructure like [Technology Connections did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqhoM3fDrQ) (spoiler: it was a bit of a pain in the arse but it worked out and will pay for itself in \~3 years)."
"So it doesn't make economical sense and yet somehow a startup car company managed to do it anyway and it's one of their best competitive advantages.  Why can't these established car companies figure it out?  Part of the reason Tesla took so long to realize profits is because they were busy building out all this infrastructure (Gigafactory, Supercharger network, etc.) and now that the bread is baked all the other carmakers want a bite.  Well too bad!  They should realize the existential threat EVs are to their ICE business and get serious about building their own charging network or pay Tesla for access."
"20-5 = 15. So you’re telling me the difference is fifteen minutes, spent once every two weeks? That’s just being silly. 

Ignore the price difference. You and I both know that you’ll recoup the difference in price due to savings in operating and ownership  costs."
"Well, yea, in countries that don't have electricity to their home yet, EV's are probably not the best option.  I don't think that's the market Elon is going for yet though."
"Fine. In the US.

So, in the US... putting non-EV cars on the market is asinine."
"Who the hell told you this? What a load of shit.   


People charge their electric vehicles *at night.* This is when there's an energy surplus.  Hell, Georgia Power even has a  program for electric vehicle owners where they pay $0.01/kwh for all electricity at night because they need to give it away."
The power grid seems to cope just fine with dryers running during the day. Not many people run their dryers overnight when most people would be charging their cars.
This is not true.  It's another bit of the smear campaign against EVs.
"The average home AC unit draws 3kW to 5kW of power when running, often for hours a day in the summer.

A Tesla charging on a basic 120v 15A outlet draws 1.44kW of power.
A Tesla charging on a 240v 50A outlet draws 9.6kW of power.

Many utilities offer time-of-use plans with lower rates at night when they have excess power to sell, which encourages EVs owners to schedule charging during those times.

The grid is already capable for the transition to EVs."
Okay you're furthering my point thanks!
Do you have any idea how long it takes to charge an electric vehicle on 110V lol?
Oh Europe doesn't count lol

He didn't found Tesla. Why are people so dead set on bootlicking billionaires when they're not the ones doing the work? He abuses his workers and tweets like an unhinged madman. I love Tesla and everything but don't act like Musk is Tesla
He's a labour rights abuser ya asshole
"Won't someone think of those poor CEOs! Damn unions, taking away my ability to treat staff like shit with no repercussions!"
"> When or if you ever start a company and get a sizable amount of employees, you’ll see why employers hate unions

That’s obvious, and kinda the whole point. It gives the employees negotiating power to counter the monetary influence of management.

If you’re a business owner, your opposition to unions kinda seems like a massive conflict of interest.

Where would your business be without your employees?"
"[Article on Elon’s assholish union-busting.](https://amp.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/10/tesla-workers-union-elon-musk)

There’s only one reason for an employer to oppose unionization: fear of worker power.

Worker power stands in the way of profit maximization that sidesteps worker concerns."
Pure conjecture
"guarantee the dude you're replying to is going to say at least one of the following things: 

* Elon is a slave driver (even though you have to apply to work at Tesla and it's made known that you will be working long hours for low pay. Source: worked at Tesla)
* Elon's only where he is because of wage theft (lol)
* Elon called a guy a pedo on Twitter one time so every good thing he's ever done is invalidated"
"Exactly! Im all for having a more progressive marginal tax rate so that if someone like Elon cashes out he pays a 70% marginal rate.

But if we make it so that billionaires cant exist, then wealth will transfer from billionaires to institutional investors (like Fidelity or Vangaurd). You wont have visionary CEOs who forgoe quarterly profits for Long term benefit. All CEOs will be bean counters."
"There is a difference in owning stock and liquid assets. Elon didn't get a $2.1B check. His share value went up. When he sells, those assets should be taxed along with everybody else. OP's comment is a statement on inequality in America. With so much of our country suffering and barely able to keep by, why do we covet true billionaires? Billionaires and corporations basically pay no tax by using loopholes, tax havens, and lobbying. The Billionaires and mega-corps should be paying their fair share and they are not. The billionaire class needs to be dismantled and redistributed. They have taken from this country and not given back proportionally. That's all that is being asked."

"All rare earth (apparently) means is that they aren’t found in amounts that make them economically feasible to recover...they aren’t actually rare...think of how much shit we have to mine just to get a little bit of any of them, vs how much there actually is, sure there’s not as much as there is silica, but it still isn’t “rare” (at least by how they want it to sound-kind of like how diamonds aren’t really worth anything/rare)"
"At one point yes, and would probably keep a good bit up to begin with, but, I suppose it would depend on the make up of the asteroid...if it’s titanium or something then great, make a spaceship in space I guess, but 1-would still have to make equipment that can go to space to make a spaceship, and 2-when hearing rare earth metals, I (and most others I think) would think of gold solver platinum etc...not the best to make spaceships out of and (as far as I know) is only useful for electronics, investment, and scientific experiments. It would make 1 and 3 much much cheaper which would be better for us, but you’ve seen what happens when someone tries to mess with #2. That said though, a 50 ton chunk of silver platinum gold and titanium, even if introduced all at once, would still be worth billions and billions (maybe even trillions, I don’t like to math)"

"Yeah they’re still really undervalued if you assume all of those goals will be achieved.

The big question is if (or when) that will happen."
"I think the point being made in that comment is that they aren't trying to sell the software. If all your software is used exclusively on your own products, it doesn't make you a software company, but a vertically integrated hardware company."
"> The car is a computer on wheels, a vessel for software.

At some point don't those two things become interchangeable?"
"Hence, a tool. A tool they use to make energy products more efficient. To make manufacturing faster and cheaper. A tool to allow the FSD and Tesla Network to operate. A tool to design all future products.

They’re not selling software itself (like an app or a program), but rather selling the stuff that has the tools or used the tools."
"I once read an article written by the mother of his children. Apparently he's quite fond of prenups. And I'd assume he has the best lawyers money can buy.

Don't misunderstand, I love Elon and I find the argument ""we were married, half your stuff is mine now"" a little weird anyways"

"So you want to claim the game is over before ford even gets a chance to release an electric vehicle. You’ve made your decision without even knowing or being open to experiencing the ford electric car. Because for you it doesn’t matter; Tesla’s the only electric car that will ever work. That’s fucking ridiculous. You can’t say “game over” before the car is even released, tested , or driven! And to your second point I.c.e trucks will be around for a long time. The rest of our lifetimes. You can’t do a tug of war with a two wheel drive versus a 4 wheel drive especially when the two wheel drive is lighter. Put the 4 wheel drive Tesla agains a 4 wheel drive ford of the same weight and you’ll see that test was designed for idiots."
"Because of the low sticker price, superior performance and the backing of ford motor company. Tesla has no support or service departments after the sale. Ford has brick and mortar service departments across the country and the infrastructure to erect charging stations. It’s ford. It’s a mustang. DoMy try to discount it as some fly by night shoestring operation."
Maybe but you just flood the Japanese currency as the fallback then.
"It is quite obvious that we are bound to become an multi-planetary civilisation, The thing I doubt is that it will happen through SpaceX. Other competitors with a lot more money will enter the market for space exploration and probably beat them."
"For those outside the US. Elon smoked in California where weed has been legalized. Since the federal gov defers to states rights (in most cases) they’ve allowed individual US states to police weed on their own even though on the country level weed is as illegal as meth.

"Tesla quality standards are on the same level as compact sedans, if we talk about the paint job even below.

I think they are way too behind on the software development as well.
"> The legacy makers can build everything above the floor relatively quickly and easily, but they are ages behind on the critical part.

Having said that, maybe they're just not looking at the problem in the right way.  There's a market for a cheap (but safe) city car that never goes beyond suburbia.  GM proved you could make something like that with the EV1, Toyota with the RAV4-EV, and Holden/CSIRO with the ECOmmodore (never put into production).  While Lithium batteries are the industry darling for weight and power, there's no reason you can't make a car with less advanced battery technology."
"What're you talking about? The gigafactory doubled the world production of batteries alone. It's very scalable, just need the will and resources."

"Yup, fools. It's taken a long time for this to pay off, both monetary and production-wise, for Elon. You've got to play the long game now."
This time it's different I reckon. Electric car production has real momentum. Even if they do get bailed out it won't stop EVs. :)

"You are correct in that there's plenty of lithium.

However, you make two mistakes. One is that your number for lithium requirement is actually lithium carbonate and not lithium. You will need a lot less lithium than 100 pounds.

Some copypaste:
Lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) contains around 18.8% lithium; therefore one tonne of lithium is equivalent to 5.3 tonnes of lithium carbonate. 

The other mistake: ""reserves"" should be ""resources"". See:

https://www.bgs.ac.uk/mineralsuk/mineralsYou/resourcesReserves.html"
SHIT!  It was 100 factories. I was so close man!  Just did a google on it.  At two years to produce and $5 Billion to build he better start selling more cars!!
"What? What experts are you talking about? Sure, Teslas are better than new gas cars, but all new cars are *awful* for the environment, and no one really disagrees with that other than Tesla's advertising. More than just the direct impact, though, Tesla makes people think it's possible for cars and a green future to coexist, which is patently untrue."
It’s called financing and reliability. A new car has much lower rates and longer warranties.
"With that attitude, sure.
But if Elon were to release a stripped down model 3 without the fancy air tech, self driving and tablet computer and just threw the gauge cluster from my Jetta into it and sold it for 30k(cad)
I'd buy it"
"Has nothing to do with TESLA's. You meant, it's hard to train automotive assemblers to assemble different automobiles."
Would it be though?
"Adding it to new construction is easy. Adding it to existing structures is much more difficult. I'm also taking into consideration street parkers, which is the majority of parking in Los Angeles, not only for those living in apartments, but also living in single family homes. Drive through Hollywood, as an example, and in the evenings when everyone is home there isn't a vacant curb to be found. Those installs will cost much more because you have to install metered service with the ability to accept payment. That means lots of trenching, labor. That's expensive. And in the case where you own the home, that you can't always park in front of, you can't run several hundred feet of cable to your car. The devil is in the details. Not to mention that when Tesla owners have lines run, most of them find that electricians jack up the prices when they realize it's for charging their expensive car."
"the big thing pushing Tesla and other EV´s in norway are massive tax advantages.

People but what is the cheapest option for them, if EV´s would be taxed to the same extend nobody would buy them there as well."
"I don't doubt that they're fairly easy to install, once someone actually sees the need for them. It may just be because I'm in a place where EVs are still rather impractical (very cold temps for a portion of the year and long driving distances being quite common), but I don't know of any workplaces that have EV plugs installed, or apartment buildings."
"It takes obscenely long to charge a car on 240 (dryer/stove outlet).

You need 480 for it to be practical, and I guarantee you don’t have the hardware to serve 480V in your breaker box."
"Norway isn’t even as remotely close to large as the US. Stop using a small country as a comparison marker to one of the largest, most spread out countries on planet earth."
"they slowed down the production because the saudis used to control nearly the entire production, the entire purpose of the OPEC was basically to ""stabilize"" the oil price meaning stabilize it on a high level to maximize profits.

If oil prices would fall due to lower consumption there is suddenly no incentive for people anymore to switch to EV´s because the price to operate will be the same at some point."
That's because Tesla is selling $50k M3s. Barely anyone knows about the bottom end M3 nor does Tesla want them to know due to the razor thin margin.
Definitely not from their cheapest models either
"IDK, my old cheap Renault doesn't cost almost anything to maintain - even when something breaks, replacement parts are dirt cheap, as is labor, since anyone can repair them.

Sure - if you compare expensive ICEs and expensive EVs, EVs might be cheaper, but cheap ICEs will beat them easily."
The world you currently inhabit.
"the fact that its 6 cylinder alone also makes sure its not even one of the cheaper cars as these come with 3 or 4 cylinders.

Ive owned my car for 8 years, had a broken transmission, did oil changes and maintenance as told by the manufacturer and even including insurance, fuel cost and all other costs combined including the cost of the car itself is still cheaper than just the initial price of the model 3

To get to the same TCO for a model 3 i would need to buy the base model, charge for free, require zero maintenance and drive the car for almost two decades to break even."
"which in itself is bullshit to list as a price, its about what you pay upfront not what you could potentially save.

Tesla was actually forced to list the actual price in Europe after consumer protection agencies complained about this practice."
"A huge percentage of Americans don’t own land or homes, and many who do don’t have garages. Your argument is based on your own diluted view of the country, and it falls flat on its face immediately. Norway is a much smaller country. Urbanization aside, it takes much less in a smaller successful country to implement country wide economical and structural changes. Your other elitist arguments that an expensive electric base model car is affordable for most Americans is laughable."
Sure thing

"""Unions have no say in what they make..."" Thanks for admitting the point."
"Comparing new cars, sure - it’s close. It’s harder to justify when it comes to used cars, though. A used 2018 corolla costs about $10k (in my area of the country at least). I’d like to see how you can figure that this has less TCO than a used 2018 Model 3."
"That OK, the crap you made up because you felt like it was totally convincing..."
"9 miles in city traffic is at least thirty minutes, right? 

So you’re living thirty+ minutes away from work, in an apartment complex with no charging and no public transportation. Correct?"
Honest question:  would you consider an electric bicycle or scooter if it could do 25 mph and 20 miles on a charge?  Cost is $1000 to $2000 to buy.
"If a Tesla costs $30k, a Corolla costs $20k, and gas costs $3/gallon, you've gotta drive the Tesla for at least 80,000 miles before you see savings.

Ballpark numbers, obviously. Oil changes over 80k mi. will cost about $1500, you'll probably save on insurance with the cheaper Corolla, Tesla torque will burn tires faster, etc."
^ This guy gets it.
"If you were to convert Texas to all electric cars you would need an extra 110 terawatt-hours of electricity per year which is a 30 percent increase in energy consumption. That no doubt cannot be supported without some modifications and planning for power sustainability. Not impossible, but you need the municipalities to be involved and have their support. Tesla and other automakers cannot do this on their own, but Tesla could support the effort by assisting in large battery storage for cities so that power plants can store energy during off peak use times."
At last some sense.

"Well sure, his effect on the world isn’t totally positive.

But that isn’t why people admire him. My comment was a response to “how is he doing anything other than personally enriching himself?” so pointing out the positives isn’t really changing the subject. 

No, he’s not a perfect person, and labor rights are a huge issue that don’t reflect positively on him or Jeff Bezos or many other business tycoons. That being said, if you’re going to rely on the goodwill of CEOs to bring about positive changes in labor conditions, rather than on regulation, you’re going to have a bad time. 

I’m not about to wait around for Elon Musk to pioneer labor rights, because no company wants to lose money treating their employees right if they don’t have to. I don’t consider this a personal mark against Elon Musk because that’s not the CEOs role. WE need to bring that change from outside as workers and citizens via regulation.

He’s admired for the industries and technologies he’s helped further, not for how supportive he is of unions. You can appreciate the positives while still recognizing the negatives need to improve."
Funny how no one wants to comment on his union busting.
Musk has been in charge at Tesla for a vast majority of its success. There are obviously many talented engineers and designers that have made this success possible but it’s safe to say Tesla would not be where it is today if it weren’t for him

"True. But worker power is more often then not abused. You and I have opposing views...that's ok. In my mind I don't think workers should have much power. I am a grunt at a job. I do my job and I do it well. I get paid, I get benefits and I go home. My job doesn't owe me anything. However, unionized workers...are entitled, always want more and get it most the time. Thus, the business hurts. Truth be told many unions harm the business model. Truth be told there's always someone out there to do your job for less. Truth be told everyone should be happy and grateful they're working at Tesla. It's growing exponentially and those that work hard and innovate will thrive. Those just wanting a job to work at will get their pay, benefits and they shouldn't expect anything more. I do understand unions are good in many ways, but they also do harm."
Ahh I see.  After I wrote that comment I started thinking about common metals that are bundled in with the term and my assumption started to fall apart in my head.
"I think you need to Google rare earth metals. They are not gold and silver.

"You're not making any sense. Ford had a value 20 years ago in 1998 dollars. If we want to compare the most valuable car companies ever it makes sense to compare 1998 ford to current Tesla, and you'd HAVE TO account for inflation because 1998 ford value was in 1998 dollars."
"I agree that robotaxi, and really FSD also, are not yet priced in to the valuation. I bought my shares on the promise of GF3 and semi with the assumption that if either of those others come online, I'll be looking at upside orders of magnitude higher than I bargained for."

The top reason I like Tesla's is because of their software. I buy it for the software.
What's 170k? That's like you having to pay your ex a coffee each month...
"You need to stop believing the news. The vast majority of Teslas enjoy fantastic reliability, zero maintenance requirements, and no need for support."
"If Ford wants to release a competitive truck at the same price, nobody is stopping them. History indicates that the Ford EV isn't ever likely to be released at all, and for you to assume otherwise is in fact what is ridiculous, given that the overwhelming pattern among ICE car manufacturers is to announce EVs as a stall tactic without ever releasing any. Exactly how am I supposed to ""experience"" an unreleased product, pray tell? Where is Ford hiding its dedicated gigafactory capable of producing the amount of batteries needed to fulfill your prophecy that Ford will meaningfully affect Tesla's market share? Are you aware that Tesla makes more batteries than the rest of the market combined, and that you need a dedicated factory to reach that scale? Why am I being lambasted when you're the one promoting non-existent vaporware?"
"> Tesla has no support or service departments after the sale.

While certainly not equal to Ford, they do have some.
My fear is Ford dealers will do like Chevy dealers did to the Bolt."

"Thanks, this makes a lot more sense now."
"everywhere? There's virtually no public charging for EVs in US cities (aside from specifically taking time to drive to a charger and wait there).

Maybe a handful of chargers per thousands of vehicles. You can't expect that people will want to spend hours a week driving to a specific location to wait for their car to charge. They need to be able to either charge at home or charge while they're parked near their homes.

As an example, [here's Philadelphia](https://chargehub.com/en/countries/united-states/pennsylvania/philadelphia.html?city_id=1231). Assuming this is accurate, there's under 200 chargers for a city of 1.5m people and (as best as i can find) a little over 500,000 vehicles. Very few houses with private garages, and of those private garages, a large % are not used for parking.

That number is based on a 2013 stat of .98 vehicles per household, with just over 590,000 households in the 2010 census."

Let that go up to 10% and you will not find a single free charing spot when you get back from work."

">  There's a market for a cheap (but safe) city car that never goes beyond suburbia.

The problem there being that they've invested a decade into the campaign to convince buyers that they really don't want that. The new Leaf isn't an ugly car, but they're not exactly posting banner numbers in the US."
"> The gigafactory doubled the world production of batteries alone.

Doubling the 2012 world supply of batteries was easy. They were only used in small electronics. Today's demand is that much higher, and GF isn't producing half the world's cells, despite making literally tons of them every day."
There isn't enough lithium to draw from the salt flats to keep up with the demand. The future gigafactories would probably be recycling centers of used power packs.
Well said. Competition is always good for the consumer.
I'm not saying I want Tesla to have the sole monopoly on electric cars. I agree competition is vital. I'd just rather new companies like Rivian and Byton become real contenders then have these ancient brands that have had to be pulled kicking and screaming into the future finally catch up and pretend they invented the re-invented the wheel. They don't deserve to survive.
"When Model S production was announced, I was sure it was a mistake. Why not just keep buying gliders and let others deal with that cost and hassle?

When GF was announced, I thought it was crazy. Why invest billions when you can just buy them from the companies that already know how to make them?

It is clear that I don't get the vision, and that if I was in charge Tesla would still be only be making a few thousand cars a year.

So when I saw the CyberTruck and my shock finally subsided, I looked at the buzz and purchase interest and just knew I was once again behind the Elon curve."
"And so far the only person this has paid off for is Elon. Tesla has spent well in excess of $20 billion getting to the point they can produce less than half a million cars a year at a price point most car buyers can't afford. The big automakers don't have investors that will allow them to spend that kind of money to make such a small number of cars. Not to mention almost all of Tesla's stock price is based on hype. 

At the current price, if Tesla could make $10,000 a year in net free cash flow per car, which would be a miracle, it would have to produce more than 5,000,000 cars a year to justify the current stock price. That's more than 10x what it produced in the last quarter of last year annualized, and that was the company's best quarter ever for production and sales. Just take a look at the price chart and any reasonable person would conclude it's a major bubble and unsustainable, but you'd never convince a Tesla fan of that. To them any price is not high enough."
Oh okay. Makes sense. Was genuinely curious because I’ve never had to really wait long for anything. Even with shipping they move pretty fast. But I had never needed a Mac part  either and figured maybe that is a longer process. Mac is still probably a longer wait than other products even in the US comparatively as well.
Wow. Even better!
While that is true its not really the case for the vast majority of the 20 million cars sold in the US
"HEPA filters aren't special expensive air tech. The marginal cost of adding """"""FSD"""""""" to a car is near zero the dangerous way Tesla is doing it and a tablet on the dash is like what, 500 bucks? Replacing an internal combustion powertrain with an electric one costs around 12k. The current ""cheap"" model 3 already operates at a loss. Tesla just has the luxury of capital markets not caring about losses compared to other car makers who can't afford to do that."
"honestly if he would so what you just described and sold it for more than 20k nobody would buy it.

Beside this the things you listed arent even that expensive the main cost is still the battery."

"Fun fact:  Norway is the top market for electric cars in Europe. The individual who owns the most Teslas outside the US lives north of the arctic circle, hundreds of kilometers from population centers."
"I had a NEMA 14-50 (50A/240v) outlet in my garage. It charged at 25 miles of range per hour.  My car supports “dual charging” on AC so I could theoretically buy an 80A high-power wall charger and easily drive it with my 200A residential service at 50 miles of range per hour.  I don’t need to, because overnight charging is plenty for my daily commute and the occasional road trip.  
I recently moved to a condo that does not have a charger in the parking garage. I charge either at work (the courthouse has a free 30A J-1772 outlet) or charge for free at the Wawa supercharger near me while I enjoy a delicious sandwich. 
I put 150,000+ miles on my 2013Tesla driving from Florida to Las Vegas and back at least 4 times and to DC and back a dozen times.  Never once did I say to myself “gee, I wish I had kept my Prius.  Or my BMW. ”.  
Charging and range are non-issues to all but the edgiest of edge cases.  You wake up every morning with 200+ miles of range and never have to stop at a gas station.  It actually saves time. And money."
"Norway is heavily urbanised, which is what half the commenters in this thread are complaining about; the perceived lack of urban charging infrastructure.

Even in the US, most of the population is concentrated in small areas; most of the country is sparcely populated and isn't particularly relevant to the discussion."
"Ok, this guy is simply trolling now."
"The base Model 3 has a five-times higher profit margin than the average Ford vehicle (source: CleanTechnica) and a higher profit margin than any other brand’s EV on the market (source: ExtremeTech). 

So, their profit margins are good. Not great, like the higher trim models, but still very good. And since sales are outstanding, this is why Tesla is rolling in the profit right now."

Lol I never said they did to begin with.  Just a typical straw man argument 🙄
"Correct. I'd have no problem with an electric car with decent range I agree with you. There are just none that are worth buying in the price range I'm interested in. I know many people here would not be willing to make the small sacrifice to spend a little more time charging. I know it seems ludicrous to you and I would agree, but consumers are lazy."
I was sitting at the lights last week and an electric scooter sailed past me on the footpath.  It took me nearly 3km to catch him since I was in reasonably heavy (but not Manhattan level)  traffic and he was just cruising along the footpath or the edge of the road.
"Solar, wind, and other renewables are growing.  Many EV owners already have, or plan to add, solar on their house so they can charge their cars from solar.  

If every auto manufacturer began today to plan for and build only EVs, the grid would be fine.  The rate of new EVs being delivered is unlikely to swamp the grid.  If it starts to, that will encourage more people to add solar and battery storage."
"Sounds like a ton of opportunity for jobs and growth! And at the same time the energy is cheaper so the consumers win too. If I were an employee, I’d rather be working on a solar farm than a oil field, but that’s just me.

If there is one thing I know about Texas, it’s that they got their shit together when it comes to the electric companies and energy. I wouldn’t worry."

"“There is no firm definition of rare earth metals, but the term generally refers to metals used in small quantities. Rare earth metals include: rare earth elements—17 elements in the periodic table, the 15 lanthanides plus scandium and yttrium; six platinum group elements; and other byproduct metals that occur in copper, gold, uranium, phosphates, iron or zinc ores. While many rare earth metals are actually quite common, they are seldom found in sufficient amounts to be extracted economically.”"

Even if the cars are super reliable bad support is not acceptable
They are already taking orders and they’ve already showed the car at auto shows. It’s happening. Don’t proclaim ford dead and the game over before the electric mustang reaches the dealer floors. It’s every bit as real as that ugly Tesla truck. Ford has tons of trucks to compete with Tesla at the price point of a Tesla. There’s the whole f series line to compete against. If yuh of war is your game; if that’s what they want to use to show towing power than they have to compete 4wd Tesla against 4wd ford. Not 4wd Tesla against 2wd ford. That’s just stupid.
If you break the door handle on a tesla you have to wait like 6 months. They don’t have parts. If you break a door handle on a ford you go to your dealer. Ford has had time to think about it. They won’t make the mistakes of the volt.

"That gets into a really tricky grey area of constitutional law.  Congress has the right to regulate interstate commerce, which can include anything which moves across state borders.  The problem comes when it is grown locally and doesn't actually cross state lines or is something which isn't in the specific purview of something Congress can even regulate (aka Article 1 Section 8).

It gets complicated, and of course the 14th Amendment sort of throws a monkey wrench into the mess too, on top of the 10th Amendment that also states there are things which states can regulate and pass laws over which the federal government **cannot** pass any legislation over and are exclusively in the scope of states.

The supremacy clause isn't absolute.  It also takes cooperation of states in most cases too."

Battery management is key to a long-lasting vehicle value
"I think there is functional software that is needed to an EV.  Software that manages charging and energy distribution.  You need software for all the integrated controls (door locks, windows, seats etc.) Basic info-tainment software etc- and the big one, safety features, auto breaking etc."
"Energy management, good stable regen that plays well with braking, good drivability feel are all huge and all mainly software driven."
full self driving is quite the difference in software and vehicle value
"> Is the software absolutely necessary? Dacia makes quite nice cars (albeit wholly plastic inside) for the minimum money possible for the car to run and have lights. I mean, autopilot and all that stuff is pretty awesome, but they are not really necessary.

Considering autopilot is software and not hardware, there's no added cost to deploying it, so when your competition has everything you do *plus* autopilot at no extra cost, you lose."

"I addressed this elsewhere so I'll just copy my response here:

> This has been drastically overstated. Lithium appeared limited because the demand was limited. Since demand has increased, new deposits have been sought and found.

> There's an estimated 62 million tons of known lithium ~~reserves!! **resources**. A car only uses about 100 pounds of lithium. Just based on the current known reserves, that's enough for 1.2 billion cars.

> Even assuming zero recycling and no technology changes, that would cover the global supply of cars for 20 years. Lithium is an element, it's infinitely recyclable.

Another user pointed out that is is raw lithium, which only accounts for a small percentage of the lithium carbonate used in batteries:

> One is that your number for lithium requirement is actually lithium carbonate and not lithium. You will need a lot less lithium than 100 pounds.

>Some copypaste: Lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) contains around 18.8% lithium; therefore one tonne of lithium is equivalent to 5.3 tonnes of lithium carbonate."
"It’s pretty much only Europe and American car manufacturers that I’d like to see go. Volkswagen with their emission scandal. GM, Ford just being boomers in general. Toyota admittedly made eco cars popular with their hybrid. Nissan went further with the leaf. And Tesla came in and made it all cool and sexy.

My ideal future auto industry is Tesla, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, some new competitors."

"I think Elon is building the infrastructure and plans for manufacturing the surface operations for SpaceX. There are some cool cars and house accessories to be built along the way. :)

Boring company is to handle the sub surface living areas. Might as well help the cities build mass transit as well for proof of concept."
"Stock prices based on hype? Nooo waaay. That's not how the entire system works though, is it?!

It's difficult to ascertain the ROI for a shareholder because Tesla don't declare dividends on the common stock. They re-invest constantly it seems.

Justifying the stock price is always up for debate because of the whole way it works. It's all a bloody game, really.

It's a growing company, it will continue to grow, that's why people are happy to throw money in. It may be a bubble that bursts but from what I'm seeing Tesla looks unstoppable.

You have to consider that the market is nowhere near saturated. They're building yet another factory in Europe straight after completing one (in only a year) in China which (IIRC) each car has a 35% profit margin. The build quality also seems better from that factory, which implies that their processes are getting better.

It's not a stagnant company, they're constantly evolving and improving. I can't really see any other companies doing as well."
"i know apple claimed to streamline stuff but as i remember 3rd parties are banned form holding parts, so if i go to get an iphone fixed, the have a ton of red tape just to get parts, Tesla needs to make sure there is little to zero red tape, a slow repair will force people to 3rd parties who are not part of the repair program same way people have done with apple"
"Doesn't need to be today, doesn't need to be tomorrow. Let me clarify, if *any* automaker came out with an electric car with 400 km's range and comparable interior features to a base model compact sedan(civic, corolla etc.) I'd buy it."

I'm just saying that me personally am interested in a cheaper, stripped down model 3(2.5?). Several of my friends have agreed with me on this so I thought I would share.

Edit: I am also interested in the cheaper fuelling cost of electric as well as a cheaper repair schedule."
"What are the parameters here though, what 10000 jobs are we talking about? What level of programming ability is needed for these jobs?"
I'm all for EV's but doesn't Norway give such massive bonuses to EV owners that buying an EV is cheaper most of the time?
How is being not urban an advantage in this case? I would think it would add the difficulty of most trips being longer (stuff is further away in rural settings) and more space between charging stations
Yes but you’re talking about changing the infrastructure on a massive scale of one of the largest countries on earth.
Why don't you post links to your sources
"Both your sources are just guesses. Base model 3 is barely profitable, and that shouldn't come as a surprise. Batteries are expensive."
"there is really not much to it.
2011 Chevrolet Cruze bought in 2012 for 11500€
total repair cost over the time was less than 3000€
total gas usage just over 10000€ covering a total distance of 130000km
All other things like insurance and even the car club membership are less than 600€ a year so i come out around 30k€ for the entire 9 years."
"Like I said before, not everyone has cheap electricity, and not everyone can charge at their place of residence. The pure scale of the US suggests that hybrids would be perfect because you can go across ten country and just make small stops for gas instead of waiting to charge. 5 minutes max for a full tank. Just because SR+ is here in the US doesn’t mean most of your average car consumers can afford it. Implying that anyone looking to buy a car can just fork over “$35000” for a base model 3 is a hilarious assumption, especially when you consider that you can get a base Honda Civic for about half that cost new and just pay a bit for gas. It doesn’t make economic sense for most Americans to even try that. 

Idk how much you look into how cities work, but there isn’t really a city filled to the brim with wealthy people that can afford an EV, charging, or retrofitting a charging system into their place of residence (good luck apartment people, Tesla isn’t for you poors apparently). 

You make me laugh"
"It was the *entire* point of the posts before yours. Car companies couldn't make electric vehicles because ""reasons"" and your big brain decided to chime in with unions as one of those reasons. You are right, though, that claiming unions as a reason is a straw man argument, so kudos on that."
"I understand all of that. But I’m just curious why you chose both (1) to live so far away from your job and (2) still live in an apartment. If I was willing to live in an apartment, I would chose to live near my job. Rent might increase a little, but you would save *so much* more money in the long run by lowering your transportation expenses. And if you wanted to live so far away from work, why not get a house where you can have an EV? 

I don’t know. I’m sure you weighed all those decisions and you have a reason for what you did. But it’s very, very confusing to me."
You do have a good point since only about 2 percent of cars sold are electric. I was thinking more along the lines of what would happen if there would be a ban on ICE cars after a certain time point like some people want to propose.
"Well it would be a crisis if we lost AC in peak summer 😂. I think we would be ready today if we charge at night, and continue to grow steadily. In order to help keep energy cheap we should convert to large battery storage for cities as well regardless of widespread ev adoption or not."

I think it's perfectly reasonable to temporarily prioritize engineering effort into making better cars that reduce the need for support. This situation isn't going to last forever. Eventually they will ramp up support activities."
It's at best going to be a low volume compliance car and it cannot be otherwise until and unless they have a battery factory. Those things are huge and hard to hide in a public company. Where is it? Answer: it doesn't exist. There is no way Ford can challenge Tesla on market share. It's mathematically impossible.

"Software development/engineering for battery management defibitely wouldn't be a limiting factor. Poach a few experts from the correct industries, put a team together and they'll get comparable performance in maybe a year."
"If software is needed to manage the battery, then that's absolutely necessary. Thanks for the information, I didn't know that. It makes sense, though: mobile phones manage batteries."
"It's also pretty easy to program, all things considered. No way that's a bottleneck."
And ideally navigation that can take into account charging needs on the trip.
"I understand the need of software for battery control... But everything else could be old-fashioned mechanics: buttons and levers. Feck, I'd have an electric car with lever window openers as long as it was electric and I could pay for it. But they never go under 20,000 euros."
"I know, but I don't need (or can afford) a 49,000 euros car... I'd rather have an old-fashioned, mechanical-button, plastic interior car, if that's possible. Is it?"
"The cost of development and support of that software is worked into the cost of the vehicles, no?"
"My point is, it's the extra cost that worries me. You can't make the transition on 49,000 euro cars. I'd need something about 20,000, and I'd gladly sacrifice autopilot and all the other perks (nice interiors, ludicrous speed, etc) as long as I got an electric car with a Dacia-level fanciness (that is, plastic interior, and the car does only the basics)."
I didn’t realize dozens of sensors were free.
"My suspicion is that VW is bogged down with software journeymen, leaderless and rife with union rules where one department doesn't speak to another. I bet Tesla have the best engineering talent and they're small enough to get things like that completed easily."
"Well that is certainly timely news, and hopefully it restores optimism in the consumer car equation. Looking over the summary of the same USGS report from 18th June 2019, it says that oilfields and various other brackish / brine deposits can produce the equivalent of just under 7 million short tons Li. 

>A car only uses about 100 pounds of lithium.

I like the newer metric of 400 watt hours per kilogram, toted as ""2nd generation"" by major battery makers. Though that is probably energy density for not just the lithium-ion by itself. The overall power pack including housing and connectors is a bunch of other heavy components. For instance, in current gen laptop batteries, somewhere along 40 watt hours (10.8V * 4 Ah) for a third of a kilogram fully packaged. Compare that to the first gen Model S at 240 watt hours per kg (double the laptop) and to the 400 range in the 2nd gen. Need to figure out Li content.

In the above example, holding triple the laptop's 4 Ah power cell energy density could mean quadruple the Lithium-ion. Therefore 1/3^-1 * 4^2 * 0.3 or about 14.4 grams. With some rounding, five percent of the 400 Wh / kg battery is Lithium-ion. 

I'm not going to worry about road-worthy weight contributions (impact / fireproofing) as the regenerative braking does most of the work in keeping the powertrain from damaging the power cells. So then, assuming 75 kWh packs on the mass-produced car would be overkill, scale it down by root 2 and you get 53 kWh which needs about 6.7 kilograms of strictly Lithium-ion.

Therefore, domestic stock of 7 million short tons Lithium is enough to produce just under a billion electric cars before refining losses."
"Honestly, Tesla is about saving the Earth, the Mars meme is fun, but Elon is 100% behind saving the ecosystem of the Earth that that is the overwhelming ethic behind Tesla. As is the Boring project. access to safe, contained, zero traffic tunnels that Teslas can self drive through and make use of their speed and handling to traverse a city unobstructed at 120ish MPH is incredibly compelling, and that makes people much more likely to go for electric cars and much less likely to demand aerial transit solutions, which are enormously less energy efficient and density friendly."
"Dividends are a small component of value. Cash flow is the primary component. Valuing a company is actually pretty easy. Currently Tesla doesn't generate cash flow at any level even close to justifying its stock price and the projections that would support the price are massively aggressive and assumes no risk in the assumptions. That's just not realistic. I'm not saying Tesla won't grow. I'm just saying investors, or rather speculators, are getting way, way ahead of themselves."
Well said!
Obviously you don’t want 10k programmers. I was just using the info that in Europe they expect legacy manufacturers to fire around tens of thousands of employees for the transition.
And this is exactly what all civilised countries will be doing shortly.
"Because in the suburbs you charge at home, just like you plug in your phone when you go to bed.  If I had an EV with a 200 mile range like a Tesla I would just plug it in every night, then have enough range to get to/from work plus whatever errands I might have - no need to look for public chargers while I’m out."
"In both countries, most of that infrastructure is concentrated in or near urban areas, so the same problems apply."

Because this information is obvious and shouldn't need saying, must less citing.

"Just graduated college and just got my first ""real"" job. Also the area near my work is known for high theft and crime at night so that's why I live where I do. I will eventually buy a house I just need to save my money which makes buying a Tesla not an option for me right now. I'm hoping that Model 3's become more affordable used in a couple years, because I wouldn't want to have an EV as my only car, but that's my personal preference since I like having a sporty car to take to the track as well."
"I think if we could magically transform every car overnight into an EV, then we would have a problem, so I do see your point.

Poor billionaire elon shouldn't have to deal with pesky unions ruining his space fun :(((
"Uh you know elon musk is a billionaire right ? And you honestly think hes the only one working to save the environment? Supporting capitalism and future generations is an oxymoron.

If we sacrifice these liberties for elons additional billions, I mean saving the planet. Our children will grow up being exploited even more.

No billionaire is going to save you.

Voting will not save you.

There is no struggle but the class struggle.

That's what most mean by for the many not the few, not billionaire worship..."
You’re lucky I don’t work for you. I’d unionize that place and turn the workers against you.
"Lol, what? Yes."
"Not having their labour extorted by a billionaire, not being forced to work 60+ hour weeks, maybe having some actual job security?"
"This comment is still making me laugh man, where would the workers be without elon ahahahahahahahahahahahahah probably doing much better mentally ? 

Where would elon be without the slaves in his parents emerald mine ?"
"Sounds like you and I would get along. I used to annoy my family with all the random shit about different things that I know (probably still do annoy them) it’s just that now since I run a lab I’m a little more focused. But it’s not every day you have a scientist that can also work on cars, correctly name artists/musicians (talkin about old/good ones) while knowing how to do electrical work and random trivia...i was the guy that fell asleep with 500 Wikipedia tabs open each night lol, I’ve just never been good with names of things (if that kind of makes sense) like I know how gold is formed, where it’s at on the table, etc, but I can’t differentiate between rare earth metals precious metals etc...that stuff just isn’t important to me"
"Still has platinum in there, and my point still stands. Maybe in 100 years, and none of those metals would be good at building a space ship but If you think that we’ll have actual tech in space anytime soon that can 3d print (or any other type of manufacturing process) a viable space ship, then I’ve got a bridge to sell you...not to mention that I said “when I hear, I think...”  so t doesn’t surprise me that I’m wrong since I’m not an engineer, and for my purposes precious metal and rare earth metal is interchangeable not to mention there are asteroids made of silver gold and platinum and those are all anyone’s cared about because “imagine the money”"
"Now that I think about the math, $5 per car, per month, is already around $20 million a year, and will grow along with the fleet."
"you just speak without knowing. They’ve already taken 50,000 orders. So you are wrong about the “low volume compliance car”assumption.  You’d have a better grasp on reality if you researched."
They were on back order for a ridiculous period of time because unlike ford there is no support for the product/ consumer after the sale. The sale experience kiosk thing is nice but then there’s no support. A ford has service departments and parts warehouses across the country. And you don’t have to hunt down used parts on eBay. You just call your local dealership. And there’s a brick and mortar building to take your ford to for Install. How are you going to get that with your eBay used door handle that comes in the mail?
"It is that constitutional question though that keeps it from being adjudicated.  Not to mention people pressing ideas like jury nullification and popular sentiment against the idea of criminal charges for minor use of marijuana or other drugs.

I personally think it is just a matter of time before courts back down on the ""war on drugs"", where it would be better if Congress got ahead of it anyway and let states do whatever they wanted on the issue and recognized the 10th Amendment.  What would be unprecedented would be to have SCOTUS give a ruling strongly recognizing the 10th Amendment, which the FBI really doesn't want to see happen."
That's the exact thinking that legacy auto makers have at the moment. Assuming it will be quick and easy is reflected in the quality of EV cars they have on offer at the moment.
"I agree!  
But... First they have to *want* to. Then they have to *know* to do that."
"I mean, that's pretty clearly false.  There *are* BEVs from other auto manufacturers, but even they'll tell you their battery management is years behind Tesla's."
"Yes. You seem to already have that option in mind; it just wont be a Tesla. If we're talking about bang for the buck though, the Model 3 is well worth the extra dosh. Car will literally be paying itself off when full self driving comes out and it drives people around for you :)"
"I imagine it'll get there eventually, it just needs time for the tech to filter down from luxury to budget cars. I could easily imagine something like a small Renault electric city car coming out in the next 5 or so years. I'm not basing this on anything really besides just market trends with cars in general. Like how led lighting started out on your Mercs and BMW's and Audi's, and had since propagated down the range to the Skoda's and SEATs etc"
"It can be, but it can also act as a form of loss leader. Manufacturers also need the drivers' data, which holds a very large value in itself. Not only that, but the more cars the AP tech is deployed in, the lower the original cost becomes.

Point is, if you don't develop AP tech, you will (eventually) be left in the dust, and developing AP tech takes a very, very long time."
"Yeah the dividends thing is quite minor isn't it? I suppose it's a sweetener more than a main reason to invest.

People have been saying what you're saying for years though. Now look where Tesla is at..."
"Oh, in that case I’m still curious as to why fire and hire 10000 people instead of retraining? I’m not trying to be argumentative, just genuinely curious. It’s cool if no one has a solid answer though."
"I hope so. I really wanna get an EV as my next vehicle. I'd love to get a tesla as they have amazing range and tech, I could make up so much money back in gas and maintence considering how far I travel, but I know factoring that into price is a bad financial decision. I think I'll save up for the cybertruck and in a few years when it's released hopefully I'll have a nice down payment."
">Because this information is obvious and shouldn't need saying, must less citing

Or because it's pretty blatantly false.  CleanTechnica (aside from being garbage in general) cites the usual outlandish *goals* with a dash of deliberate misleading, and ExtremeTech is quoting a third party estimate.

If the base Model 3 even made *comparable* margins to the average Ford vehicle, Tesla would be solidly profitable.  Clearly that's not the case.  A company that isn't profitable doesn't have the best profit margins.  This is one of those no-brainer things."
Great stuff.
and yet the model 3 was supposed to be the affordable Tesla which it is sadly still very far from.
"In ten years I’ll still be living in an apartment. I highly doubt I will be going electric. That and my current car is only three years old. I’ll still be driving it in ten years given that my last one was 16 when I sold it. 

That and not all electricity is cheaper than gas. My power comes from a hydroelectric source on the other side of the state, which is marginally cheaper than other parts of my city receiving power from a coal burning plant. It costs less for me to fill my car with premium every month than it would to use one of the two pay-by-hour stalls that go untouched on my campus to charge, which are not Tesla-specific and will take even longer than a supercharger which I haven’t seen in years"
What insult? Big brain? 🤣
"As electric cars become popular, apartment dwellers will start choosing complexes that offer electric charging. Apartment complexes that dont will be less desirable.

Just because chargers are rare now doesnt mean they'll always be rare. Good news is that electricity is everywhere. We just need the right outputs in the right places."
"Instead of a Tesla, buy TSLA :)"
But the point being argued was that there was a lack of infrastructure.  You have a completely different point of being young and not having the income.  So your argument is not applicable or relevant to what we’re discussing.
"The key in this thread is the transition time.  Ten years?  We're fine.  Two years?  Not fine.

Even aft a ten-year cutoff people are still going to be driving their ICEs (grandfathered in) so the transition is going to have a long tail."

"None of which justifies any abuse of labour. Do you want work to be a race to the bottom, whomever will exploit themselves most for the least compensation, gets the job? This hatred of workers and glorification of billionaires is sick. With standing up for this you are standing up for a world where workers burn out, arent fairly compensated, have no security, and have no time for their family/ themselves."
Very weird and creepy to keep calling me sir
"Hmm I never really got into podcasts (probably because when I gave them a shot they were absolute shit) but if u have any good ones you’d like to share I’ll give them a shot, I usually listen to music or audio books (currently listening to expeditionary force) while I’m in the lab but I’m just about done that series"
Superchargers already are monetized for most cars
Well they’ve taken the orders and the customer deposits so you do t know as much as you think.
Fairy nuff man. :)
Can you link to what you’ve read?
"nah you are comparing actual TCO of a car vs the minimal buy in price of another car.

If i only charged a model 3 at home for the cheapest price i can get calculating with 18kWh/100km and zero charging losses the electricity to go 130000km would have cost me over 7000€

if we would compare actual TCO we would also have to account for the insurance of the Tesla which is 50% more expensive than mine is right now for worse coverage."

"Dan Carlin's hardcore history is amazing.  All about war history.   They are very long so it's a good commuter listen. Science radio is another good one.  And of course if we are talking about podcasts, I have to mention the Joe Rogans experience.  At first I assumed it would just be bros talking about fighting and DMT. He actually has alot of very smart guests. His podcast is how I discovered Graham Hancock."
Time indeed will tell. But there's no magic here. The batteries have to come from somewhere. It is far more likely that Ford hasn't thought through what they're doing than that Ford has found some way to break the laws of physics. *Every single* legacy carmaker's EV announcements so far has consisted of grandiose promises followed by disappointing results.

"You've *more-than-doubled* that ""minimal buy-in price"" investment into the car.  


Therefore, TCO is a great analysis."
Cool man thanks for reviewing my profile for me ya weird creepy guy
"You're right, if you're that fucked in the head you think you should be fairly compensated and treated well at your job, you should just fuck off and work at a tapas bar, entitled little shits."
Why dont we all just do tapas instead ?
Hold up lemme strap myself in for this sick socratic argument lemme prepared to get owned
"Cool edit from tapas to Tesla with no comment, rude.

But yes, they are. Good discussion lol. Google it mate"
"Fortunately/unfortunately my commute consists of either a 5 minute drive or a 15 minute bike ride but my 8 hour work days consist of about 3 hours in the lab and 5 hours doing nothing in my office during incubation times (I love my job) so I have plenty of time to kill. I’ll have to check them out thanks man. Ehh, I get what you’re saying about joe Rogan (I’ve seen a few episodes) and (unless I just chose the wrong ones) I don’t like his (or most peoples for that matter) political views...like I’m half republican half democrat-I believe in science and that we shouldn’t have wars and etc but don’t believe I should have to pay for other people to survive (side note-I have no problem helping people that help themselves, I just don’t believe i should have to support someone if they aren’t going to try/game the system, I used to live near Philly and the number of people in section 8 housing on food stamps and welfare, but yet somehow have a Mercedes s class is bullshit) and don’t feel that everyone should get to go to wherever whenever (if you want to come to my house, no problem, knock on my door and wait for me to let you in, don’t smash by window and sneak in (and no I don’t support trumps treatment of immigrants, that’s just wrong)) and the episodes I saw of joe rogan basically consisted of “pay for everyone, everyone can come here, if you don’t hate wealthy people you’re a nazi”...maybe I just listened to the wrong episodes but it kind of left a bad taste in my mouth considering how shitty both sides are and the fact that people will defend their sides to the death...sorry for the rant"
"Ford doesn’t Do things without thinking them through. Especially something they are going to call a mustang. They’ve taken the orders, they’ve accepted the deposits. They’re not going to suddenly realize they don’t have batteries and call the whole thing off. You are being ridiculous. I really struck a nerve with you die hard - bury your head in the sand and ignore the future-Tesla owners. The Tesla is an ugly car and the truck is even uglier and ford is gunning for your market in a big way. Hold on to your asses cause it’s going to be a blow to your bottom line when the blue oval is in the e.v. Game."
Lol you're having fun being upset with the world.
"I too disagree with alot of political stuff he says. I'll usually only listen to the ones with scientists, authors, or other heavily specialized professionals.  That's where the true quality is with that podcast. I will say he at least admits it when he is uninformed or just talking out his ass.  You dont see alot of wealthy and influential people do that these days."
"Lol is 50000 pre-orders supposed to be impressive? Even if they pull that off (BIG if), Tesla had 400000 Model 3 pre-orders, three years ago. Last I checked 400000 is more than 50000. Where do you get this absurd idea that Ford is going to ""blow"" Tesla? I am stating simple numerical objective facts. I do not have my head in the sand. You do. I'm no die hard fan. I follow the facts. You're the die hard who ignores reality."
You sure you arent gonna replace one of those words after I reply ?
"I’ll have to give him another shot then, and yes it’s true that you don’t see many of any influential people that admit they don’t know shit about something. I watched I think like 3 episodes with the last being the Bernie one and I just lost it, everything Bernie says is either said in bad faith or is flat out wrong. Like the bit he says (can’t remember if he mentioned it in the podcast but he posted it on twitter before) about insulin being given away, then went from $30 years ago to $500 today is as bad faith as you can get. All of that is technically true, but here’s the thing, the insulin that was given away originally and used to cost $30, still costs $30 even without insurance. The $500 insulin that everyone bitches about is the fancy time release self regulating insulin that had millions invested in it in R&D. That argument is like putting a ferrari next to a Honda, then saying they are the same thing and it’s bs that the ferrari isn’t as cheap as a Honda...but the truth doesn’t fit his narrative (doesn’t fit the rights either, and that’s the problem with our politics). But everyone eats it up because they don’t know what they’re talking about. They just hear “something’s expensive, it shouldn’t be expensive, there’s no reason for it (there is a reason, I work in pharma, there are many reasons for it) so I’ll make it cheap” and people eat it up because they want free shit and then that’s how you have pharma companies stop R&D and only make drugs they already have...hope people are ready for that...again, sorry for the rant...any specific episodes you’d recommend of JR for me to check out? I’ve got an hour or so to kill and could use something to do it with"
For a company that hasn’t made an electric car it’s very impressive. It’s huge. The model 3 is following the model s and it’s a third of the cost of the s. So low it might be a disappointment in quality. Ford is just getting into the game and they’ve sold more than Tesla did before the model s came out. With worldwide brand recognition and superior service Tesla would be wise to ignore you and to take the competition seriously. I doubt that ford forgot that they have no batteries and they just cancel it all and go away as you are hoping.
Best of lifetimes to you sir. I'm happy and there's nothing you can do to change that. Best of luck feeling better about yourself by bashing others through your screen and keyboard.
"Forrest Galante, Dan Carlin's, Graham Hannock, C.S. Gwynne. 

Those are guests that I can think of at the moment that I liked.  The last one is right at an hour long, he is an author and talks about North American Indians."
"Companies that haven't made electric cars inevitably discover that electric cars are a completely different ballgame and that their ICE car making history doesn't carry over, contrary to your insistence that it does. The Model 3 isn't a disappointment -- what world are you living in? Even the Model Y will be out and for sale to the public before the Mustang Mach E, and the Model Y by all accounts will outsell the Model 3, let alone the Mach E. Your comment about service is telling. A big selling point of EVs is that they don't need very much service. Fantastic news for customers. Terrible for dealers. Ford hasn't thought through how they will deal with a rebellion on the part of their dealers who are not going to stand by as their service revenue goes up in smoke. You and everyone else keeps insisting competition is coming ""soon"". Time to put up or shut up. I'll believe it when I see it."
Conjecture but ok my le good sir have an epic life hating workers hoping they never do anything about it lol
"Sweet, I’ll check them out, thanks man"
You think I hate working ... Or you do?
"Oh and if ya wanna test your patience, start up one of the Alex Jones episodes. See how long you last before your head explodes."
I did a magic edit now same as you x
"Lol oddly enough, I actually “enjoyed” his videos...not because I agreed with anything he said, but because it was like...like have you ever seen a show like real housewives or vanderpump rules? (I’ve seen the latter but not the former) where it’s so stupid it’s entertaining? Kind of like that. Like it, watching it made me realize that no matter how shitty of a day I may be having, at least I’m not him...glad he has to pay the sandy hook families"
"Nice, I won't fault you for it. I was positive and just asked for clarification. What you fail to realize is that I don't hate workers. I hate the fact that workers like you feel entitled to MOAR. 

If you start a job, you know what you signed up for and when you signed up you were probably very grateful. But somehow that mindset changes and the view that the company owes you something comes into play. When in reality they don't owe you anything at all. 

I actually love hard workers. Hard workers rarely stay stagnant in a work environment. This is because they know that their work ethic will get them their MORE whilst being grateful. They get their more from moving on to bigger better things that they clearly deserve. Some hard workers don't even want more. They just like working hard and I love that too. 

Please don't mistake this for me hating workers. Feel free to edit your comment again to refrain from saying I hate workers ;). You're more than welcome to edit it to saying I hate lazy ass bitches whom want free handouts. Oh, also feel free to downvote this comment as well...fake internet points don't really appeal to me anyway. Since you think they're important I'll up vote every comment of yours. I hope this brings you some joy!"
"That's the perfect way to describe him.  And while I can confidently say he is wrong about most things, I don't think he should be silenced or de-platformed because he has been right about crazy conspiracies before."
"I'll take ""what is coercion"" for $400 please. Love being exploited cus I need to eat 3 times a day 🙏🙏🙏"
"I really feel like we would get along pretty well because I agree completely. Everything about cancel culture (whether it’s for actors or others) is bullshit. Like, I don’t agree with anything prager u says, but for twitter to ban him, for x to ban y, etc, just because you don’t like what they say, is actively working to erode our first amendment rights, and before you know it, we’ll be like China...side note, if you’re in New York (specifically near Nanuet/pearl river (or nyc since I’m there occasionally)) or south jersey/pa (Mt laurel/cherry hill/philly) I’d love to buy you a beer and chat sometime"
What are you doing about it besides complaining and praying? The time spent here with me on this board is time you could have learned what UDEMY is... You can use that to get some certs in the tech industry if you try hard enough. There are jobs a plenty that pay very well. Best of luck to you sir.
"Same for you if you're ever in Austin!   Since you brought up Twitter, the JRE podcast where Jack Dorsey and Tim Dillon debate about that exact topic will be right up your alley"
"Yes,  because obviously my problem is personal, and not with the systematic exploitation of 100s of millions. I'll go get some tech certs, and global labour extortion will end. Thank you Gallieg444 PBUH."
"No shit? I go to Austin each year for the us Grand Prix (formula 1 (if you didn’t know)) I’ll be down there this year (it’s in November) we’ll have to meet up, I’m gonna send you a message so you don’t get lost in my notifications. I’ll check that one out first, I’ve been looking for something where people discuss that in an adult way rather than just “reeeeeee nazi” “reeeeeeee libruhl” like what shit usually is"
"Haha once again educate yourself on how to make a real difference. Start a company...employ some people whom you can pay as handsomely as you want.

What I've pointed out to you are facts. That you agree with but dislike. I know there's exploitation. I am not denying this. But to say unions are great is bullshit. To call Elon a union bashing asshole is bullshit. He's running a corporation in an industry that hasn't seen a real newcomer flourish in decades. He needs to bring profitability before anything or else those people lose their jobs anyways because Tesla goes bust. GM, ford...they're going bust and I'm sure an argument can be made for the fact unions are a contributing factor to their demise."
"You'll like that one.  Jack Dorsey was on once before that podcast and people gave Joe alot of flack for not being tougher with the question, so he brought Jack Dorsey back with his lawyer and Tim Dillion who is actively against Twitter's practices."
"Yes it's those damn unions ruining everything. I wish we would just come out in the open with it and enslave every worker, maybe a couple companies here n there will make a bit of profit (the ultimate goodness)"
"Lol or.. maybe just maybe we could work towards legislation that changes the corporate landscape. Am I dreaming? No, it could happen but won't. Simply because people like you would rather aimlessly argue on the internet instead of making a real difference."
Legislation like protecting union organisation? I somehow feel like you would have a problem with that
"In all honesty if unions changed slightly I'd be ok with it. My problem with unions is, in many cases they strive to get as much as possible. This in turn hurts the company which ultimately hurts the workers. I'm all for everyone getting paid what they're worth. It's a macro issue that won't go away because we're a global economy. If wages drive the price of good up somewhere else in the world will undercut and provide the items for less. Demand for the product at the unionized factories goes down and the workers lose their jobs. My other gripe with unions is  the fact they defend everyone...no matter how lazy of a person it is. Dog fuckers play the game and get away with it."
"Maybe unions can be so militant because their existence is threatened every day, and its miracle any manage to start, especially in this day and age. 

It's perfectly reasonable and valid for you to have those gripes with unions. But do you not have similar issues with companies,  who are immensely more powerful?"
"Yes, I do. We're debating in a Tesla thread. Where you've said Elon is a union basher asshole. Union basher..yes. Does this make him an asshole? This is where we began. I say no. Profitability has yet to be sustained for him to pay his people more. If he does everyone is at a loss."
Livermore CA-84 exit?
It’s Taller than I was expecting also I really love that blue
Fancy plate frame for a beta car lol
Yep.
The blue seems to have changed. Recently it seems to be a much darker shade of blue compared to the unveiling and what's on the official site.
"Cool cool, gotta keep my eyes peeled"
that is a 10 billion dollar development cost picture
"For the people who don't get the joke, the coolest thing in this picture is obviously not the Model 3 but the first recovered first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket, which is visible with its landing legs deployed next to the building.

It is truly amazing what Elon Musk has accomplished. A good example of a picture that is worth more than 1000 words.

Oh man..... would you look at those beautifully trimmed bushes !!!
Elon's World
I can’t wait for this thing. All these people at my gym drive these huge trucks and I just wanna pull up in the Cybertruck so bad.
Are they bringing silver back? That's the big question here
God I love the CT so much. Can't wait till I have a matching camper I can attach to it for long camping trips... I wish there was a 500 mile dual motor version that cost halfway between the 300 mile and trimotor version.
Model 3 is the subject of the photo you say?
"Wow, nice green shrubbery!"

That's a weird f-150.
can we get a high res pic link? Plz
Damn that truck is growing on me
Ngl i am starting to like the look of the cybertruck
I have no idea why but I seriously want to buy this car.
Sadly when I drove around SpaceX all I saw was business as usual 😔
How do I convince my significant other that the truck is frogging beautiful? Subliminally cropping it into family pictures or ?
Such an aesthetically pleasing building....
"Every time I see the cyber truck I have a different reaction. 

This photo? Looks so badass and really love it. Other spy shots? Looks like a badly rendered PS2 in game vehicle. 

Someone buy me one so I can form an in person opinion."
It's so cyberlicious.
"To quote Veruca Salt... ""I want it nowwwww"""
I'm pretty sure I'd freak out like a little kid if I randomly saw the Cybertruck.
"I think this might be the coolest picture ive ever seen in my entire life, and its not even a good picture"
"Hm, interesting that the stripe between the front lights isn't illuminated here"
Way to bury the lead!
"Wow, look at that Model 3! Where’s the Cybertruck?"
"Ok, I know everyone is joking about the Model 3, but is the CyberTruck in the picture photoshopped or something?

I don't remember it being that sleek."
[deleted]
The model 3 looks like an alien
Cool picture of the new roadside curbs constructed on Crenshaw Blvd.
What happened to the top of the fire hydrant. This is obviously photoshopped
The future has arrived
California moving the world into the future. California Uber Alles.
I think I see Elon giving me the hang loose in one of those windows
Looks like cybertruck front lights during the day are different
Looks like the main bar is off with only the two headlights on the side turned on. Interesting to see how customizable the light bar will be.
"Wish they did public tours of the building there. Visited the area in August while on vacation.

You can drive in, but the armed guards will show you on your way.

Best you can do is park around the corner (to the M3's right and walk over to the F9. Hyperloop tunnel is around the corner there as well.

And the Boring tunnel (+Monty Python tower) is directly behind where the picture taker is standing.

Lots of cool shit in just 2 square blocks. 

http://imgur.com/gallery/Cb6W2GF

Btw, F9 is HUGE when you see it in person. Pictures don't do it justice. This one is B1019, the first successfully landed."
"Murphy, it’s you!"
"Is it bad I want the roadster, S, and X in this picture too? Maybe roadster 2?"
Looks like a picture taken on mars in 84 years.
this is look like out of date and living this moment is invaluable.
Almost got wooooshed for a second
I just drove past there a month ago
I see what you did there.
Cyber Future.
"Off topic, I know, but what's up with the Cybertruck not having side mirrors? Is it going to have any or is it going with cameras?

My admittedly not super-high quality right side blind spot camera gets overwhelmed by direct light or even large variation in light in frame, can't imagine cameras being sufficient for every situation."
Where are the trucks windshield wipers?
You mean sybertruck?
can someone explain the fire hydrant to me? is this normal in CA? it is so odd
Really want a cyberhatch or cybercoupe
Is it me or does the front of the CyberTruck look eerily similar to the mask of Iron Man?
That thing needs bigger tires badly
looks like a scene from Robocop.
"crazy how big this is. saw a model x today go past me about 4 feet to the left, realised how big it is. Truck is gonna be gigantic"
Let’s see Musk build a rocket that can lift it into space.
yeah that’s a really cool model 3

I honestly thought that truck was a joke. It's real?
Quality post
no the fire hydrant is the main subject
I’m still waiting for the picture to finish downloading.
"Hey, silly question, when does the truck design start to grow on me?"
Lmao that title
These things are going to be on mars in no time.
"Is your refrigerator running?

No, it's on wheels."

Cyber truck?
slow clap
Not just any Model 3...it looks like the rare silver Model 3!
We gonna ignore the cybertruck then ya?  Okay

"I know you're making a joke, but that is without a doubt the coolest thing in this picture. It's absolutely revolutionary. The Cybertruck is also incredibly exciting and cool, too. Just not quite at the same level... Until it becomes the first test payload of Starship and gets launched into the sun or something."
So we just gonna ignore those perfection pruned rose bushes huh
Not even /s it actually is
"""He does at good rockets"""
Thanks for the chuckle lol.

That’s a sweet fire hydrant. Never seen one with that shape before.
"I used to work there, and the engines on that rocket were soonbe of the last I touched before I left.  Very cool to see it again"
"He had us in he first half, not gonna lie."
Is it crooked?
What’s the joke again?
So much coolness in one picture. And then there's the cybertruck
"The longer at I look at this picture, the radder it gets."
And cybertruck

Yes. That great man did all of it by himself. Hail Elon.
You mean a picture of stuff that is worth more than $1000
You mean we shouldn’t be happy with relying on Russia to get our astronauts into space and relying on foreign oil?
Thank you Fox News.
I still thinks it’s pretty ugly. I see now that I am an idiot.
Imagine calling someone an idiot for thinking this design is ugly
I prefer no bushes and cleanly mowed lawn.
"Did you notice that beautiful pole betwixt the rectangle and cylindrical object? Perfectly centered.

You want to buy a truck to flex on the truck guys?
What Cybertruck?
I can’t f***ing wait to roll up on em.
I preordered the 3 motor but I'd be completely happy with a dual motor. I specifically ordered it for the range.
"Yeah, they really need a dual motor with the big pack. Honestly, might not be that much cheaper though."
"350-400 would be perfect. Asking a lot, but I’m hoping the “300+” means 350+. No need for sub 3 second 0-60 or 14k towing, but the range is money."
"Well, yeah... there’s nothing else notable in the photo"
I think OP was mistaken. It’s the fire hydrant.
"No, it's the SpaceX booster"
"I was going to say, what a lacking caption lmao."

Right?  Too bad the lense distorted the image.  I wish I knew how to photoshop stuff so I could make this all straight
"Good chance the whole design will alter between now and release, seen alot of good points for things like pedestrian safety, etc. But hopefully the changes aren't too drastic."
I just parked at the supercharger station that is onsite and open to the public.  Easy peasy and the guards can’t do anything about it.

"No, model 3"

Yeah really man. He should just hang out all ducking week at SpaceX HQ waiting for Musk to drive the truck by.

Why did they accomplished it at Tesla though?

"Wow, that’s some downvote karma right there."
It’s unbelievable how they think this fool did it all himself. Vision this and vision that.
"NASA is still by far the best, highest funded space agency in the world, and the US has the most satellites in operation. 

America also produces the most oil in the world, and of our imports, 43 percent comes from Canada. We're not exactly reliant on foreign oil."
"Ironic because you’d think that conservatives would want to have less dependence on the Middle East and other countries for oil. 

You’d also think they would rally behind an American company.

Oh did I forget that renewable energy is cheaper as well? Electricity is also cheaper than gas. Don’t they like saving money?"
My MAGA brother in law is so stoked for the Cybertruck.

The cylindrical object is a [landed Falcon 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANv5UfZsvZQ) just fyi ;)

"Couldn’t have said it better myself. As an engineer Elon, inspires me to keep applying and work endless hours to make his vision succeed. Because he is a leader. I am not mindless or a slave. I choose to follow and build and engineer solutions for companies which management/vision/leadership aligns with my personal purpose. If I ever do end up working at Tesla and the internal speaks different towards what we believe then I will speak out. Otherwise, as an outsider, I stand by his vision."
"No no no, you forget the golden rule of being a business cynic. If everything works out great, it was the team not the paper pushing leader who did it. If everything fails it was the incompetent leader's fault not the team."

It’s what I expected in this sub.
"Ah yes, look at all these other visionary car companies"
Nah he is always sure to credit the Tesla team who work insanely hard to make this happen but it is very safe to say that neither of these companies would exist today without him. That is why he gets the admiration and following.
We're reliant on foreign oil being traded in USD
"> NASA is still by far the best, highest funded space agency in the world, and the US has the most satellites in operation.

Without a doubt. They were unfortunately at the hands of Congress and the President at the time who prematurely ended the shuttle program with no new funds for a replacement human delivery vehicle. Now SpaceX and Boeing are very close, but this should have been planned to happen after the shuttle’s retirement. 

Overall, net US consumption still relies on 11% foreign oil. That’s the lowest ever, but our demand still exceeds supply and Tesla (and other automakers releasing EVs) is helping to close that gap and eventually helping us to become a net oil exporter."
"But that is good for the country, we can't have any of that!"
Ahh I think I see the issue. None of those line their pockets as fast as screwing people.
Yeah but their brainwashing to hate things the liberals like is stronger than their patriotism or desire for American companies to succeed.
"> Ironic because you’d think that conservatives would want to have less dependence on the Middle East and other countries for oil.

To be fair, we're well on our way as of November of last year thanks to all the fracking we're doing.

An electrified carbase would still be **so much better** for no end of reasons.

There's a limitless well of technologies that can make the power feed of an EV carbon-free. That well gets much shallower when you're trying to make _burning hydrocarbons_ carbon-free.

You can live in say, Illinois or Pennsylvania _today_, and if your EV is filling up in your garage at 3 in the morning, the grand-ass majority of power it's getting is carbon-free. You're __already__ displacing an embarrassing amount of carbon, and that's not even counting the 5KWh head start per  ""gallon-electric"" you get from not burning a fuel that had to be refined first... by burning _more_ fuel.

I'm _super_ excited about the prospect of the different every diesel pickup, SUV, or lord help you, _Hummer purchase_ that will be replaced by a Cybertruck. And it will be replaced by the kind of person who would have gotten _way_ less than EPA estimates on those vehicles 'cause they want the level of power they've seen on Tesla's model."
USA produces more oil than it consumes. It's not depended on ME
Stow your misplaced political garbage. There are plenty of conservatives on board. Don't group a couple million people into the same group just because of your ignorance.

"Ah yes, vision wrote the code and built the car. Wish I had a vision of an electric car and to throw an iPad in there. Really out of the box stuff. I thought the tablets were gonna stop at fridges. Wish I had that vision so I can hire the most talented people in all those fields to create my grand vision. Lol

Edit: I wonder if he’s seeing the vision of flying cars yet. So once technology get there, he can take credit for that too."
">Meanwhile, the U.S. is becoming a major exporter of energy for the first time since the 1960s. This, along with a strong domestic energy sector that focuses on exports, could help a smooth transition away from the petrodollar as energy exports replace the capital inflows from Saudi purchases of U.S. assets and uphold global demand for the U.S. dollar.

We're not really reliant on the petrodollar either."
"The shuttle program should have been ended years before, and maybe even cancelled before it ever flew. It was much more expensive than any of the alternatives, and the shuttle was built too big so it could handle a particular mission that got cancelled. 

Don't get me wrong, I like the shuttles, but they were not the right way to go to space. Hence it's cheaper to launch on the more reliable Russian rockets."
"Ending the shuttle was the best thing that ever happened to human spaceflight. 

Didn't seem like it at the time of course, but jesus christ now that it's gone the entire heavy lift launch market has opened up in a huge way that never would have been possible in a world with the shuttle.

The shuttle was the bastardized pet project of the DoD and the Nixon administration. It was cool but I shed zero tears for its end. It was a ridiculous concept that never should have been built and it cost the lives of 14 astronauts that never would have died on conventional launch vehicles. It raised costs, reduced access to space, and was a blight on NASAs deep space programs."

They are conservatives who have a biased against Tesla despite the fact that Tesla actually has end goals that align with conservatives political views. 

Did I say *all* conservatives? No, I did not. Read carefully next time and understand the context in which the comment was written.

Your party has largely been brainwashed to hate environmentalism. Not all of your party.  But the fact that it’s a sizeable portion of your party says a lot about your party.

"Do you think Apple could have made it to where it is today without Steve Jobs? Microsoft without Bill Gates? You think just anyone can lead a group of engineers to these outstanding feats of innovation?

Do you think MBAs could be summarized with ""hire smart people""?"
The ignorance is in assuming that because this is what you see on TV or social media that it represents every person in a political group.
"Don't blame your inability to articulate a point completely as the fault of the reader. The term ""conservatives"" inherently implies all within the category, not a specific subset.

You didn't use the word all but your statement was the same. More importantly you DIDN'T say ""some"" which just highlights your ignorance.

Triggered? Sure, ignorant idiots stereotyping a specific group does piss me off."
"Honestly though, why is that so weird?  He loves Teslas.  At least since experiencing one.  They’re fast, high tech, and designed/made in America.

He still thinks I am nuts for living in California though"
Oh but he wasn’t going to buy a Tesla because he likes trucks.  Aaaaaaand now he can have a truck that is also a Tesla.  He reserved his before I did mine

"This is more accurate. I never realized people seriously held that position until my own sister became a convert, and eventually started sharing all kinds of misinformation from some echo chamber on FB. I don't know what the compulsion is.... to be anti-establishment, anti-common-knowledge, believing one's self superior for finding the ""real truth"" when most people ""can't understand because they've been brainwashed by sci-fi movies and fake government cgi"". Who knows, but it's surely something along those lines of thought. 

The saddest part is that no logical argument you present, no amount of facts or deduction, will ever convince them of their error. All their evidence is truth, while all *your* evidence is flawed or manufactured. They have to see the light in their own time, if at all."

"How come those companies you mentioned haven’t crashed and burned yet without any “vision” since gates nor jobs run those companies anymore? Innovation still happening without them, what gives? Do you think the people that actually invent this stuff lack vision of what they’re creating could become without Elon the god? Or do you think it’s a matter of resources?"
"Nobody's discrediting his (or any CEO/founder's) work lol. It's just that you almost never see iPhone users endlessly revering Jobs, or PC fans constantly praising Gates 

but with Tesla/Spacex/anything Musk fanboys? Cultish worship..."
"It's not ignorance it's generalization. Ignorance would be saying, ""I'm sure Republicans would love to see Tesla succeed. It's a true American success story.""

Generalization is saying ""because most Republicans seem to blindly drink the Fox News' Kool-aid, therefore I'll assume all Republicans are pro-coal power and anti renewable energy"""
"The fact that you can’t understand the context in which my reply was referring to (again talking about a largely conservative media outlet) proved you’re the only one with triggered ignorance here. You lack of ability to understand what was being said in the context in which it was stated is beyond ridiculous. Quit nitpicking and step aside, the adults are having a conversation."
"Conservatism is dying, by definition. Get used to it."

"Yea, not sure that is available to us, the general public."
"They got new leaders, is why. That still doesn't detract from the fact that the founders of these companies did amazing work in pulling together amazing people to produce amazing work. It's not all their effort, but much of the result can be attributed to them. 

People like Elon sponsor engineers, material scientists, etc., to do their best to solve specific problems. He isn't a god, he's a dedicated man with goals he shares with his companies. Innovation will happen no matter what, but someone has to be the first."
Incumbency
"The man kick-started some revolutionary tech. Of course he didn't do it by himself, but he's a main driving force of his companies that he founded, and he still works damn hard for them.

He's also a fairly decent (albeit a bit weird) guy, which is relatively uncommon amongst corporate America bigwigs."
"Everyone worships Jobs lol. ""he was a total asshole but a visionary"""
"Generalization is a sign of ignorance.

Admittedly, your second statement is near respectable. The quantifier ""most"" at least allows that it is one's opinion and can be based from general appearances or available media.

Where one shows ignorance is in the gross generalization, it usually starts with
Black's are...
Liberals are...
Millenials are...
Gays are..."
"""Ironic because you’d think that conservatives would want to have less dependence on the Middle East and other countries for oil.""

""Again,talking about a largely conservative media""

Adults own their shit, you just keep trying to pass the blame off yourself."
"On a comment highlighting someone's ignorance you use an ad hominem, brilliant...

Thanks for supporting my point"
"That’s my main point, I’m not saying Elon doesn’t provide any value or anything like that. It’s when people act like he did everything himself is what I don’t agree with. It’s a group effort and they did it together. One person can not give us something as sweet as a Tesla, it takes an army of people and it did."
"If you support environmentalism, maybe you should disavow the modern US Republican party..."
"Again, if you’d understand the context in which my comment was made (in reply to a comment about Fox News) you wouldn’t be so confused. It takes specific types of people to read into what is being spoke about and not taking things for face value.

Unfortunately, you’re not one of those people it would seem like."

Let me just fire up Son of Anton and claim this prize.

When does the competition start?
"I’d bet they offer any successful hackers positions on their security team (or something like it). This type of competition is useful to expose weaknesses, but contracting that fix out to the person capable of hacking it seems like a decent solution."
I wonder if the 'car as reward' is a hidden incentive for the people that win to report other vulnerabilities in the future. Because then it concerns their car as well.
The thing is the real Tesla hackers already have a free Tesla you know what I’m saying yoink.
I wonder how many minutes it will take.
"Invent middle-out compression

Come up with AI named Son of Anton. 

Get them to meet. 

Profit!"
A hackrf  would be a good start for spoofing keyfob transmittions
"It’s always smart for companies to do this, because the alternative is a hacker finds an exploit and sells it on the dark web. If the reward from Tesla is greater than what you could get from the dark web and is legal, then might as well cash in on the reward through Tesla."
"For some reason I read the prize as ""$1 million and a free car wash""."
This is just a bug bounty program to find bugs.  They are paying for a person to help make their cars more secure.  Apple does this too with their bug bounty program.
Time for a Tesla to run doom
I've got a brick. Who knows how to hack?

"But the NSA doesnt need a free tesla or 1 million , so they wont give up their new assassination tool."
"I mean, it’s really just a $1m reward... if they can hijack a Model 3 then they already have a free car"
"I can’t imagine the cold sweat the security got when told of this. One thing is to know there are always risks, but quite another when your own Mgmt puts a bounty."
My strategy would be to mount screens in front of the cameras to trick the autopilot.
"I'm confused. Is the free car in addition to all the cars hijacked, or is that just an obvious benefit of being successful with this?"
"I have a feeling the cheat would be to hack the humans behind the competition. Identify serial numbers and hack the database for key sécurités then clone it and call the car. 

Humans are always the weakest link, and all you need is one drunk employee..."
Don’t need the money and it’s more fun to turn off people’s sentry mode and use summon to move their car a little. You’d think they’d notice when they come back and the mirrors are folded in.
"As I understand it, the main problem with Tesla's software isn't that it's ""insecure"" but that large parts of it are sort of hastily cobbled together, poorly architechted garbage. I guess that's what you get when you have your telematics team stuffing a bunch of games into the thing instead of making sure that UI is responsive, the music player doesnt shit the bed all the time, the web browser works, log files don't kill the flash, etc. It's pretty bad optics to tell the customer that they can trust the autopilot software with their life, but don't worry if you have to reboot the MCU three times to get your A/C to turn on. 

People need to stop giving Tesla a pass on this; the UX has gotten markedly worse over the period of time I have owned my car despite the additional features added. Something that ought to be an embarrassment beyond words for the world's most high tech automaker is instead defended. ""But new features take more resources!"" ""You are just mad you don't get the free games."" ""You should expect this; it's the inevitable effect of progress."" -- bound to hear plenty of this, especially from Model 3 owners who don't seem to think they will ever be in this position. Look, my car is 2 years old. I am not asking my nav to run at a buttery smooth 120FPS. I am asking for the goddamn screen not to take three or four minitues to display the changelog after an update. I am asking for the control menu not to take 5 seconds to switch between pages. I am asking for the audio and climate controls and homelink function reliably and as documented. I am happy to give back all of the games and farts and ahoy-hoy just to return to being able to control the car without frustration.

Putting $1mm towards a security bounty is a bit disheartening to see, TBH. Not that I don't think it is important; the thought of someone being able to take remote control of a car barreling down the highway is pretty terrifying. But I would be much happier to know they were doing this in addition to making progress against other longstanding issues."
I can hack them but the event is in Canada? hmmm
wouldnt they just do a gnarly background check on you if you came close? or get put on a list?
Who's going to let me practice on Their model 3. Let me borrow it for a few weeks please
Would be helpful if Tesla would actually grant researcher status to those who have requested it... but they don't. So has anyone been granted researcher status? I'm sure I could RE the car back but if they just decide to lock me out I don't want to get lawyers involved.
If it has voice commands and microphones like those in the google home/alex then its possible to hack using lasers.
Just not my car please.
"In the precendent à breach was found on the Internet Explorer who was permitting to access at dat car. Elon then said that the Tesla will switch to chromium, as this been done?

"Media ALWAYS do this. Especially with companies such as Apple, where the title is something like 'Apple to pay up to $1Million if you hack them'... yeah, if you get remote root code execution, which is next to impossible."
What sort of career sets you up to be able to successfully compete at this sort of event?
What about roundhouse kicks?
Makes business sense. An attack would cost more than a million dollars and this will probably get more than a million dollars in free marketing.

The whitehats would make more money on their own freelancing if they're that good.
"I really think the prize is secondary to the reputation boost, zero-day exploits for sensitive or popular products can go for millions of dollars."
"That's why Tesla is doing it. If nobody can do it with such a huge prize, then it's fairly safe to say nobody can do it. And if it turns out someone can hack into it, well, they get a free car, and Tesla learns of a flaw they can fix."
Its common for companies to reward White Hat hackers to try and prevent them from selling their exploits.
"This isn't the first time Tesla has put a car in the Pwn2Own competition run by the Zero Day Initiative, doubt they think they're winning loyalty, but rather purchasing a guaranteed vulnerability with a car - aka VERY cheap deal"
Not very hidden to be honest.

You need a car to do the hacks though.

"As a non-IT person, I love these kind of competitions. I wish they’d put it on twitch. I’d watch the highlights haha"

Maybe never. Tesla has done a very good job of building very secure internet connected vehicle.

Good security teams promote this kind of ethical hacking. It benefits everyone.
"I can't imagine a scenario where the security team is ""told"" about an event like this and not included in the process the whole time.

Are there people who really think Tesla's entire security team was just...informed one day? Alrighty."
I believe it needs to be a software exploit.
"No, this is a ""white-hat"" event, essentially a forum for skilled hackers to make a name for themselves and make money without getting on the wrong side of manufacturers. They can bring their research to this event and demonstrate what they have found, potentially earning a lot of cash without getting involved in the zero-day black market and staying out of prison:) All the folks competing at these competitions are already on all the lists...

Tesla is actually really ahead of the industry here, they implemented a program a while ago where hackers won't even void the warranty on their vehicles if they register with Tesla beforehand... that means Tesla will fix the car if they brick it, making it much less expensive to aggressively attack the computer systems."
Somebody watches Smarter Every Day
"Tesla never used internet explorer... they used an ancient version of webkit (the engine safari, and chrome are based on, though chrome/chromium is substantially different at this point despite starting its life the same).

"Indeed it is. But after the competition nobody (except for a few people ) will keep looking for exploits. But if I would win a Tesla by hacking it, I would try again after they updated it and would keep trying and reporting vulnerabilities so they can fix more security issues. I would do it to improve my own car. It's like a double incentive"
"Computer programming and hacking are long hours of people mindlessly going over code, staring at dump files, throwing darts at the wall and coming up empty and then that one moment where everything comes together. That is for those that actually end up finding an exploit, the others that come up with nothing... They don’t even get that last moment.

"For the experienced hackers it might be interesting -- open up a document that has your list of known 0-day exploits, scroll through them, and try each one and capture the output.

A lot of times exploits fall into the same categories -- insecure endpoints, exploit automatic configuration by spoofing, buffer overflows, timing attacks, privilege escalation etc.  What's interesting to me is how many ways a system can fail to protect against these attacks.  Not always to the fault of the developer mind you, as these kind of vulnerabilities can sneak in the most arbitrary of code imports.

Will be fascinating to see the results.  I'm not smart enough to exploit these with what little knowledge I have."

Because of all those stories about Tesla vehicles being hacked and stolen that you never read.

"I’m under the impression that they can just control it through a master/service API account. No need for them to clone your card.  

I know during purchasing the cars are registered to their Tesla account as well as your own so I would assume service centres have a process to request vehicles be controllable by them during visit.  


As for rfid card cloning I’ve never done it but my impression is it’s quite easy to do. If you can scan the card then you can duplicate it."
I don't think it being a big bounty program makes it any less interesting.

It's the RCHSA study guide. This will give you the entry-level information and kind of stuff you can do with RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), and in turn CentOS (RHEL and CentOS are basically the same thing). 

&#x200B;

Read through it and work through the practical studying parts. Spin up a VM on VirtualBox or Hyper-V on your computer and get to practicing. I am happy to show you how to set this up if you're bran new to all of this.

You sign an NDA when you take the test, so I need to leave out specifics. What I can recommend, is practical repetition. The test could be something like, ""Here's a Virtual Machine. Now, do this list of things. When you're done, let the test teacher know. We'll let you know if you pass.""

Take a small note of salt with that. I took my RHCSA when it was in 6th edition. This is 7th edition. From what I understand, the tests do change a bit between versions, but the format might be similar. 

  
All I can say is, practical practice. Google like crazy. Ask other people who have experience in this. Feel free to message me if you have questions. I actually lead a small group of tech ""brown bags"" on a community Discord to talk about stuff like this to other community members who are just starting out and learning. You are more than welcome to come to that. There are no stupid questions.

> Hey, did you know the sky is blue?

This shows you think bug bounty programs are a common enough concept to openly mock someone who is trying to explain what they are.

To which I maintain my opinion that you are drastically overestimating the technical knowledge of the average person. Note: ""Technical"" does not always refer to computers and electronics. Bug Bounties are a *technical* term that most people do not know. If you wish to hang this entire conversation of my use of the word ""technical"", feel free to try it.

If you have a point, you are failing to reveal it here.  Care to tell us what your point is? Nobody was talking about things being interesting and you are bringing it up as a complete non-sequitur."
">Who was talking about anything being less interesting?

In both of his posts, he said ""it is *just* a bounty program"". I don't know how else to take that other than him belittling it by saying it's basically the same as Apple having a bounty program to hack iphones. The fact that it's a bounty program doesn't change the fact that it's something brand new that's very interesting.

I am not going to argue the rest of your useless points regarding terminology. The concept didn't need explaining, and telling people what the technical label is for something they already understand doesn't add any value whatsoever.

If my comment wasn't mature enough for you, fair enough, but don't expect me to care, even a little bit."
"> I am not going to argue the rest of your useless points regarding terminology.

Not surprising.

> The concept didn't need explaining, and telling people what the technical label is for something they already understand doesn't add any value whatsoever.

The concept DOES need explaining, and thank you for illustrating my entire point. You have failed to show how this is a common concept ""everyone knows"", so just pretend it's a minor issue and run away without explaining yourself."

Doesn’t it have a lot to do with people rushing to get Tesla before the federal rebate expires? I got my X delivered at the last minute as well.
"That’s kinda amazing for the new kid on the block. 

JLR delivered 166,560 the quarter before last and they have a bigger model range!!"

920K since 2013. So nearly 1/3 of all Tesla cars made in the last year.
It really is. Tesla is growing huge
That's actually within the numbers Elon gave.
[What it’s like to own a Tesla](https://youtu.be/8k7nWp9hFNY)
The most patriotic thing I can think of is to hate a domestic car company that builds its stuff in the US  and doesn't burn oil
"It’s BS. Every other car company is making electric cars at a big financial loss while their ICE divisions take a sales hit. Tesla is becoming a well oiled machine making the next generation of vehicles at a profit. (And they’re enormously more vertically integrated than any other automaker while spending $0 on marketing)

Edit: Lots of hate in the below replies. Yes, Tesla spent a lot to get to where it is now. No one is saying otherwise. That's usually how it goes (e.g. Amazon lost money for 19 consecutive years before ever seeing a $1 in profit). The fact is, Tesla is **Trending** up. Their product line is expanding, increasing unit production and unit margin, and innovating the next generation of batteries. 

Who would you rather invest in? Tesla, the company that's about to lift off? OR a bureaucratic and slow moving legacy automaker that has the wrong type on engineers to tackle this issue?

I pick Tesla."
"TESLAQ is most likely run by some arm of the big oil companies. They don’t believe it, they’re just doing anything the can to kill Tesla (or at this point hamper it)."
"The Tesla shorts are just petulant children at this point, dug in to their viewpoint and refuse to admit they're wrong. Look at this dumbass in Aug 2016 saying how people should be SHORT Tesla and definitely not long:

[https://www.cnbc.com/video/2016/08/15/time-to-short-tesla.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2016/08/15/time-to-short-tesla.html)

If you listened to this dumbass you'd have been down 40% just one year later and OVER 100% to date. This is the same idiot whose hedge fund just reported ""performance"" of about -5% last year vs. the S&P gain of 30%. He's STILL short Tesla BTW. Imagine paying someone management fees for losing your money for you?

I can understand maybe you're a 22 year old kid fresh out of business school, you're looking at Tesla's financials and by all traditional measures you conclude it's overvalued. It's definitely not a Buffett stock, I'll admit that. But someone who is supposed to be an investing expert should understand the power of a good brand. A Tesla is more than just a car, just like the iPhone was more than just a phone. I'll bet this dumbass was still buying RIMM in 2008 because the iPhone didn't have a keyboard. A whole community of enthusiasts is forming around this company who are going to be very loyal to the brand for decades to come. Anybody who is still short Tesla is a complete moron. There are many, many ways to make money in the market. Shorting Tesla is just a terrible idea."
A lot of this is paid for by the oil industry. They have a very real interest in delaying electrification. And trolls are cheap.
Ignore the folks and enjoy the success of Tesla. Why do you even waste time on them
"Even without short sellers, Tesla would see disproportionately negative news coverage, because corporate media runs on ad revenue.

Since Tesla refuses to pay for advertising, the media does not have a financial incentive to spend time focusing on positive Tesla news.  Because the oil industry *does* pay for advertising, the media has a financial incentive to ignore positive Tesla news and to cover negative Tesla news.

It's fine to argue that editorial decisions should be wholly separate from advertising, but we all know that's not the case in most newsrooms anymore."
Oil. That’s a lot of infrastructure and sunk investment. Electric cars will be the death-knell for any traditional ice car manufacturer and the oil companies that supply the fuel and motor oil that keep them running.
Contrarianism.  They don't like that people like him.
"Some are trolls, some are just that myopic, many are both."
"Well the stock is going to the fucking moon, so they can hate all they want."
[removed]
They are idiots. I cant really explain it any other way at this stage.
"They short Tesla because they're either long with another company, or fossil fields."
"I am very thankful to the shorts, they found it in their hearts to kindly buy me a beautiful Tesla."
"TESLAQ folks are mostly idiots.  But they do have a point here.

These numbers are often used by investors justify paying a premium for a stock under the assumption the growth from guidance is built-in.  Share prices almost never pop because the company hits the low end of guidance.

The one exception I can think of is when there is a lot of short positions that are pushed to exit.  How much of today's pop is due to irrational bulls vs defeated shorts, I don't know."
"Because he's a piece of shit fraudster who one day will sit in a jail cell. He looks the other way when racism affects his work force. He ignores employee injuries, he fires and retaliates against whistleblowers. The cars are mediocre econoboxes, fun torque, meh otherwise.  The product and fans who support it are ignoring common human decency for selfish virtue signaling. What evil Tesla brings to this planet. Sad."
Well he's got to fail in something at some point the odds can't remain in his favor forever.
"Because he’s reckless and committed securities fraud. Also to get his numbers, he skipped a crucial wheel test on model 3s called a brake-and-roll test in 2018. Tesla’s have had known suspension issues and numerous cases of wheels that fall off. He’s also avoided recalls to keep the stock price up, at the expense of customers safety. The list goes on and on. It’s easier to jump on the Elon Musk fan train ; and harder to dig deep on what’s going on with this company. I hope at least one person reads this and does some real research and thinks twice about buying a Tesla. [Tesla Deaths](www.TeslaDeaths.com) www.TeslaDeaths.com"
"112k without GF3 contribution and with Christmas holidays at year-end too. Surely a profitable quarter, perhaps we might see four profitable quarters in 2020 to finally silence the doubters."
"Incredible!

I’m curious what their target run rate is for 4Q 2020 at GF3. (I’m guessing they’re planning on making Model 3 and Model Y there?)"
"Interesting about local battery pack production, I thought that was what was going into the new building which is currently being built."
That's China for ya.
"Take that with at least a grain of salt. It's most likely an extrapolation based on throughput over perhaps one shift and possibly not even with all operations happening at once. Sort of like okay we can install 100 seats in an hour and we can install 124 headlights in one hour so let's do some math: it looks like we can do 3,000 cars per week.

Just something to consider."
"My bet is that in 2020 they increase production at the same rate as in 2019: +50%. So it makes 550k.

We can be pretty sure that they will at least maintain their 105k (built) of the last quarter, so the starting base is 420k.

If they succeed in building 3k / week in China, that's +150k, for a total of 570k.

All this is without taking Model Y into account. If you're on the pessimistic side, you can guess that Model Y mass production will begin late Q2 2020, and then the production of Model Y will slow a bit the production of Model 3 (because they share so much parts, ramping up the production of these parts may take some time).

If you're on the optimistic side, then oh boy! 550k is clearly the minimum they will produce in 2020, and we should be ready for 100k or 200k more if everything ramps up smoothly."
"Interesting thought: with those numbers, Tesla should produce it's one-millionth car next year.

It's two-millionth car could then come in 2022."
"Right now, we are practically at a run rate of 500k."
"There's 360k with the 3.

Then the unknown # of Y. I estimate ramp up to vol production around Q3 mid to Q4. So maybe 75k for Y for the year.

GF3 maybe around 100k to 120k

GF4 is maybe 2021. 

So 535k for 2020."
I think it will go down with the loss of federal incentive. That was a large factor driving sales this year.
Whatever you do don't sell them anytime soon.  Tesla remains a long term investment.  You'll be kicking yourself if your shiny Model 3 would have been worth a million in Tesla stock just a few years later.  It seems likely that Tesla is headed to 3-6k per share in 5-10 years.
"I have enough at the current stock price to buy a model 3, but I'm going to wait until the cyber truck.. and then probably just borrow the money and keep the shares hahah"
You’re allowed to curse on the internet

Glad I didn't sell all my stock.  HODL GANG!
"nah, they will still claim fraud somehow."
"Nah you wont see 750k.  I'd be very happy with anything around 600k.  Right now we are poised to generate 500k/yr, at current conditions, assuming they can ramp it a lot more, we could see 600."
While market was down though. And Tesla typically goes down hard when market is down.
[deleted]
Many don't realize how the stock market works.
They’re up in pre-trading so far. Assuaging fears about missing guidance is likely enough of a local booster to stay that way.
market open 10 minutes and the stock is up over $20 a share.    Seems like the market is reacting positively to the news at least initially.
"Actually, increasing oil prices and instability in that market would have a positive effect on Tesla I'd think.    If Teslas are selling so well with the very low low gas prices we have now, just imagine if gas prices double."
Tesla may decouple from the market as a hedge against rising oil prices.
"If oil prices go up, so should Tesla stock :)"
"Oil prices going up should be a good signal for TSLA, high petrol prices are great for EV demand."
"I've been thinking all today how high the spike would have been, had the whole market not gone down.

Up 16 points. Could easily have been 20 - 30+ on a good day."
Look at the stock again lol
How dare you shed some reason on this! It is impossible for TSLA to dip!!! /s
Yep but all that really is a positive for Tesla. Tesla is now around $450 per share so well up for the day.
I would guess installations will pick up rapidly now. I think they were waiting for the supercharger V3 production line to ramp.
"You’ll likely kick yourself a year from now for not having bought more shares on January 3, 2020. 😉"
"About  921,046 + 2,450 Roadsters - wrecks."

"I saw an article declaring ""Tesla US Sales down YoY""."
Which ones do you mean? I can see them attacking teslas lower end mark on its 360-400k delivery target.
In China?
Should be one on the 6th or 7th!
That's for the 1 million car
"""YeAh BuT BaNkWuPt"" TSLAQ losers have no credibility whatsoever. I have a feeling we'll be fucking with them well into 2020. I actually love encouraging shorts to double up their positions on TSLA, mostly because I take great joy in watching them bleed $$$."
There is a supply issue
"Why are you guys all constantly saying this? Wasn't that narrative debunked ages ago?

Surely we can retire this meme now?"
BMW sells about 310k a year in the US pretty consistently over the last 3-4 years. While Tesla has grown 30% yoy (supply constrained) everyone else is either up a couple percent or broadly contracting. With GF3/4 coming online they look to either continue or increase their rate of growth...
I ordered nov 15th.  Haven’t heard a peep from anyone.  This is where the whole dealerships shine. Dealerships want to sell you a car. Tesla just sends me to a voicemail box which nobody responds.
priced in :D .
2 > 0
Better than borrowing two at 309 to short ;)
Cars meaning Model 3s
Yes.
"Bad bot. M3 is ""Tesla Model 3"" in this context"
Where did ya see that?
Can't they do both?
"Fix it before what, selling any more cars?  Just stop making and selling cars until something vague is 'fixed""?

Because if they stop selling cars and idle their factory and show rooms and delivery centers they can do something they can't do if the factory is churning out cars?

I say sell more cars, lots more cars."
I don't think so.
The last relationship between Fremont and the UAW ended on....[not so friendly terms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nSBEZ1lAIY)
"If you do not currently own a car, this is true. If you are replacing an ICE, this is false. People who replace vehicles tend to not drive their current vehicle off a cliff. Instead it is sold to the next person who is replacing their even older and less fuel efficient car. This chain continues until someone scraps a 20 year old beater that gets mostly recycled. 

Also, the energy required to build an EV is recouped by the fuel savings after about 40k miles of driving. 

So please stop spreading this myth."
"As though used cars grew on trees?  Your new Tesla will be someone's used Tesla someday.

  
Perfectly good cars don't get scrapped because you ran out and bought a new car."
"Not true. The actual production is only 15% more, and that changes as soon as you start driving it. Most owners will charge the difference  within20,000miles. https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/life-cycle-ev-emissions"
So there is a demand issue then??
That really puts it into perspective lol
"There's only the one factory in Fremont, right?  Having toured that factory, that number seems hard to understand.  The production line moves quite slowly.  It's hard to imagine how they're pumping out 1,000 cars a day.  There must be tons of parallelism happening in that factory that you can't see on the tour."
"What did Tesla struggle with before ? 3,000 a week I think?"
"Guidance since the beginning of the year has been 360,000 to 400,000."
Tesla guidance was 360-400k.  Street estimate  a day ago was about 106k this quarter.  6 months ago very few analysts thought they would hit their guidance and aggressively attacked their target.

"*foreign oil*

And (at least indirectly) pays for weapons that kill our brave soliders.
"Plus they have added cash flow from software sales and millions of miles of data for R&D. 

I want all EVs to succeed but Tesla is light years ahead of traditional manufacturers."
"> while spending $0 on marketing

This is the truly amazing part of this story. In 2018, Ford spent 2.3 BILLION dollars marketing. Toyota spent $1.4B. BMW managed to only spend $296M."
"You deserve a 1000 points for the ""well oiled machine"" pun you buried in there! :)"
Man I **hope** people are talking shit. Might be able to pick up a few more shares at probably the last discount the stock will have.
">well oiled

LOL"
">Tesla is becoming a well oiled machine

&#x200B;

There has to be some sort of ""electric"" alternative to use here... But I'm too dumb to know what it is ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
"This just isn’t true. They do not spend on traditional media advertising, but they do spend on marketing. For example, the cost of the referral programs."
">Tesla is becoming a well oiled machine making the next generation of vehicles **at a profit.**

Occasionally... that's still the one asterisk on Tesla's success.  They haven't had an annual profit yet."
Take my up vote!
Quick correction. They spend on marketing. They spend 0$ on ***advertising***.
"I would add the 20 million ""funding secured"" tweet as marketing cost ;)"
"tesla absolustely spends more than $0 marketing - they just don't spend it in traditional fashions.

They owe a LOT of roadsters -- but nowhere near how much other companies spend, to be clear."
"Yeah, Tesla isn’t going anywhere, I can’t believe people are still saying they’re going bankrupt. 

GF3 and 4 are going to really help sell even more cars(especially with 4 new models coming out), I think 2020 is going to be the year Tesla and their EVs really take off."
">That's usually how it goes (e.g. Amazon lost money for 19 consecutive years before ever seeing a $1 in profit).

Actually, Amazon was profitable a lot earlier than that. The reason they had $0 profit is that they reinvested all of the profit back into the business. They could have had profit earlier if they just stopped reinvesting. It's the same story with Tesla. They were starting to become profitable with the Model S and X, but instead of enjoying the profits they reinvested all of it to build the Model 3. Now they're becoming profitable with the Model 3 but they will probably put all of that money into building Model Y, Roadster, and Cybertruck."
I thought you were being hyperbolic about the ~~marketing~~ advertising comment but I looked it up and it's actually true. That's buck wild and a really interesting tidbit. Thanks for posting.
"Amazon didn't lose money for 19 consecutive years... that's just accounting. Tesla on the other hand isn't unprofitable due to accounting and have been profitable due to things not really related to their business (ZEC etc).

Would I rather invest in Tesla or another automaker? Why does it have to be one or the other? There are plenty of vastly more profitable and successful, high-growth companies out there to invest in. TSLA has not been a very good investment in recent years."
"I think on a 5-10 year horizon you are correct on all accounts. 

However when investing you have to look at current valuations and how long it will take for your increases to come to fruition. 

Today, (and for the remainder of 2020 and into 2021) Tesla is facing MAJOR headwinds. Canada, USA and China have all finished major EV subsidies as of Jan 1. China is facing increasing inflation (pork is up 70% as an example) and the China economy’s growth rate is shrinking.  

Tesla will have to compete against ICE without subsidy, and in countries facing economic pressures. I don’t think 2020 will be kinda to Tesla stock. In contrast to something like ACB which is down 75%, and has huge upside in 2020. As always, buy low - sell high. 

For the record I love Tesla and am long on the company, but I just sold my position at $430 a share when I bought in at $178 6 months ago. Turned those profits to cannabis and Uber. 

But what you really have to ask is Tesla going to go up in the next 12 months, or should I invest elsewhere and return when the stock retreats to the low $300’s. 

We are not Tesla haters, but don’t see value in investing at $450+ a share."
I don’t think Nissan looses money on the Leaf
Are they making a profit yet? I thought they were still losing money. Also is this total their US vehicles delivered or does it include the Chinese factory deliveries in China.
"They don't spend $0 on marketing.

They have a website.

They have a PR team.

They work in search.

Idk where this nonsense comes from. Shit, they don't even spend $0 on ADVERTISING (Advertising is a small, small portion of marketing)

That being said, yeah, they run lean for sure."
Tesla lost money in two out of three quarters in 2019 so far.
">  increasing unit production

Production of the S & X is down."
A well oiled machine... no
"I don't think it's possible to kill electric cars at this point, but they can certainly hamper and delay uptake."
"It's more likely just an echo chamber (kind of like this community can be), where someone sees something on CNBC or a negative news article, looks for it on Twitter, then stumbles upon an argument made by the $TSLAQ community. Since that community systematically block those with opposing viewpoints, the new ""member""  sees one side of the argument being made, decides it would be a good idea to short the stock. Once they do that, they have a financial incentive to dissuade anyone they come in contact with in person or social media from buying the stock or the product (since this obviously would very slightly negatively impact the stock price). It becomes a positive feedback loop.

The company needs to maintain a positive cash flow going forward. Not needing to issue new shares will make it relatively immune to the downward pressure shorts create at the time of shorting it. Once they cover their position and move on to another target (or get out of shorting stocks entirely due to the bitter pill they swallowed with $TSLA), they will no longer be so ardent of detractors. They will psychologically probably forever dislike Tesla the company and crap on it at every opportunity for the rest of their lives, but the ""campaign"" will lose steam over time as long as Tesla can continue to grow.

I'm sure there are likely also oil and automotive company trolls stoking the fire and there is a bias against Tesla to begin with from media since they don't receive advertising money from them, but I think $TSLAQ is its own thing and would be there even if there wasn't any involvement.

For those that think there aren't paid trolls, you should search for the trolling Samsung was caught doing with Apple posts on social media. While a different industry, it proves there are trolls paid for by large companies to attempt to compete for and/or retaliate against the other companies doing the same thing. It's part of the information and IP warfare these companies do. It's just common sense."
Shorting TSLA is just a business expense to them.
"They had their chance. Tesla and EVs aren't going anywhere now.

Look at the mad rush from everyone else trying to be the next Tesla.

Tesla has become synonymous with EV. Like iPhone and cell phone.

Tesla has created the EV market singlehandedly and no one else's product is even close. They're all crap to copycats. From the Ford MachE which looks like a Tesla inside with minimalist buttons and the big screen.

They're not even doing a good job with it. But they want it before Tesla can totally take over.

Teslas are what? Nearly a million EVs now? Next year when Model Y isade they will start hitting 2 million.

A couple more years and they'll be at 5 to 7 million EVs with no one else close.

Honda, BMW don't believe in EVs. Gm too. Fuck them. They need to die off so a new blood Co can take over."
"I think TSLA at today's price is still a great short opportunity. It has nothing to do with admitting being wrong. Tesla on paper isn't a great financial performer and we still see no evidence of that changing.

There have been plenty of massive growth stories in recent years that pumped and then fell back to reality after financials just didn't catch up. Tesla's financials still haven't caught up, so I don't see why being short is technically the wrong long-term position.

And shorting Tesla has made lots of people a lot of money. It's a very volatile stock. Why are you assuming all shorts only place bets and the bottom and lose all the way up to the top? From mid-2017 to mid-2019, TSLA was down 50%. Doesn't that mean shorts could have made a lot of money? From mid-2015 to early-2016, it was down 40%. Heck, only a few months ago the stock was like 50% lower than today.

Plenty of great short opportunities for TSLA and plenty of people made lots of money."
Well said
"Saying that is just throwing political fuel on the short sellers fire, because it’s just not true.

Cars and car brands are an emotional topic for nearly every American.  Almost everyone has a “team” they’ve invested in over the years.  That and humans have a natural propensity to dislike change - whenever new technologies become popular there’s a significant part of the population that is inherently skeptical.  Then on top of that you have employees And unions of other car companies & dealerships who are incredibly politically powerful who are worried for their futures.

The anti-Tesla crowd is a strange cross section of political and personal beliefs that cuts across society.  To oversimplify them as saying they are “paid for by the oil industry” is just trolling them and emboldens them against us."

"The oil industry probably loves full electrics: for every one made that’s enough batteries for around 7 plug in hybrids to not be made, increasing net oil consumption relative to if they were."

"It would be extrapolation from an hour or two. It means if they can avoid stoppage of the line, such as from a human error, for an entire week, then they would have 3,000."
"Agree, but still encouraging.  They wanted to test all lines at full speed before ramping up the supply chain."
"True, but they did this as well for Fremont assembly.  It's looking at each part of the chain looking for bottlenecks and roadblocks to ramping production up further. \[It just might be more of a reach when they aren't demonstrating it over a 24 hour cycle\]"
"Pretty good analysis.  I bet they guide conservatively; 500-550k.  If we assume model Y will cannibalize model 3 a bit, and GF3 has some fits and starts in both supply and demand I think 570-600k is where they will land.  Any more than that and the stock will moon, but seems unlikely."
"They seem to get better at everything they do. They seem to learn from their mistakes. What strikes me as interesting is Elon acknowledges every major mistake, and addresses how to overcome each one.
   
Maybe the Model Y will be better designed for mass production. Maybe the ramp up won't be such a devastating failure. Whatever mistakes they'll make, they'll learn from it, but they're sure to mess up somehow.
   
I'd say 600k, with massive slow downs of the Semi production and slim profits each quarter except for Q4, when they start selling the roadsters at a 50% margin."
"And > 600k vehicles looks good enough on its own, but throw in 100k Solar Roof production that is rapidly ramping and that Wall St. currently values at zero and well ...."

"That's an important point. Having more cars on the road is important for Tesla's acceptance. Teslas are not being scrapped, only new Tesla's are being added to the fleet, so 500k more Teslas means another 500k cars out there, people are seeing them, talking to people about them and they are becoming more ""real"" for a lot of people who had only read about them previously. This is an important factor that will drive demand forward in future."
"Yeah, true. Volvo was at 570k in 2017, can't find the 2018 figure, but it won't be much different. Tesla will pass Volvo in 2021, but could do it in 2020 even. What a feat for a young company..."

"I keep waiting for them to have a bad day so I can pick up some more shares and I kick myself for not buying more previously.  I had been in and out of it a few times and I really should have doubled down this time.  I bought a while back when it was on the way up, it got a bit squirrelly so I liquidated.  It dropped quite a bit at one point so I bought some more shares.  As it continued to drop little by little I kept averaging down.  My average share price of my current shares is $236.77 so I'm up about 89% at this point.  If it keeps on this trajectory I'll be a happy camper."

Personally i would totally like to buy a tesla right now and even with our expensive electricity it would save me around 900€ a year compared to my current car but the buy in cost is so high that nobody can afford it.

buying a model 3 in Europe starts at around 47k€ if you take the long range with FSD you are looking at 61k€

The people who have a problem with an increasing oil price are also the people that dont have the kind of money to buy a tesla or any other EV until you can get them used for under 10k€"
Tesla already sells every car they make.  I suppose they could make more S/X.
"Lol, yeah — over time (read: not over the span of a single trading day)."
Instability in that market damages buying power more than the rising oil price will likely dictate.

"My friend is finishing a very respected executive MBA program in North Carolina.

So, as much as you’d think we need to retire the meme ... there are still people out there."
go read TSLAQ people.    they think the cliff is still coming.    There is always some reason why they are selling more cars like pull forward because of tax incentives ending or many other reasons.
Detractors say that demand will surely collapse because US tax credit expired for 2020 and the *bijtelling* income tax change in The Netherlands. There's a fundamentally different lens of future sales which Tesla naysayers see the company through and don't understand. That is why sales figures must be fraudulent because it just doesn't make sense otherwise.

After a certain point, it's the *novelty* of the data, not the sheer quantity, that matters. My whole commute was novel the first time I drove it on AP (but even then not really, because I wasn't the first to drive that road on AP), but after that? My 15,000 miles of commute every year might only have a few meaningfully novel data points in it."

Yes and they greatly increased production capacity and margins.
They’ll be profitable in the last two and are clearly trending in the right direction. Q4 has great top line growth and strong mix with higher S/X sales and M3 price increases. Q3 showed great control over SG&A costs. All of these bode very well for strong Q4 profitability.
"Lost money on a GAAP basis, produced positive free cash flow in two out of three.  Likely to end the year in a significantly better cash position they entered in.  This is far more important than GAAP profitability if you believe that the EV market is growing."
"""Lost"" money by investing in their own growth and improvement of their capabilities. If you've got money to invest and you're a great investment, then you should never make a profit.. and ideally (appearances notwithstanding), you should be taking on some debt. It looks like most people still haven't learned from AMZN (the profit argument is what e.g. had the press screaming to short it when it was at $300).

Though, that might be complicated because Q1 is traditionally a pretty bad quarter for auto sales."
i mean they just bought the land for GF4 and will need to pay a decent sum upfront to start construction so there is certainly a lot of money to be spend in Q1

Germany will probably be slower. It also seems like the factory will be more complex because they want it to be more capable off the bat. I expect an 18 month build out.
Hopefully not as long as it takes them to build an airport
"Yes this is my understanding. If you were truly ""capable"" of something you would do it today given it is something you desire to do. Some part of the process is capable but some part of the system obviously is not, whether it be cell supply or workers at your disposal."

Yes exactly.
"1) Why in the world would you compare an ancient dying ICE business with a new EV and Autonomy business?  Also Tesla’s plan is for all terrestrial transport, not just cars.  And the plan is for Tesla Energy to be larger than Tesla Transport.

2) There is no rule that says Tesla will have the same low margins, nor a maximum of 10% marketshare like current auto companies.  If there is such a rule, please point it out?

3) Tesla is going after all transport profits. So if you want to compare, add in the value of all dealerships, automobile insurance companies, Tier1 automotive suppliers, oil companies and all gas stations. How does that comparison look?"

"Yes, I'm assuming for the US markets.   The electricity supply here isn't dependent on oil (only about 1%), so prices of electricity shouldn't skyrocket compared to gasoline.

I'm assuming those prices include VAT, which is not included in the US price.    Sales tax is anywhere from 6-9% generally, so you're still a little higher, but not dramatically so considering the transport costs."
Oil prices arbitrarily going up for any given event sickens me. So glad I don't have to play that game anymore with my EV household!

Aka Confirmation bias
I think my problem was buying online.
"Leasing is very common with premium sports sedans.  Luxury manufacturers often subsidize leases in order to juice demand, without the negative of lowering the price.

Tesla does not subsidize the lease and assumes a much lower residual that ensures they won’t take a loss at the end of the lease.  Therefore Tesla leases are not as attractive as others.  Also Elon discourages leasing by not letting the user keep the vehicle at the end.  He states the cars will be much more valuable because of full self driving, so if buyers are aware of this, they may opt to buy rather than lease.

Surprised your friends buck the majority."
Irrelevant but yes and no complants about service
"No, but as the son of an automotive worker, growing up in the area of the country where the UAW had both car and agricultural implement factories, I've seen their ""fight for us"".

The plant my dad worked in voted for a union in order to get a contract from one of the Big 3.  UAW declared our factory was too small and didn't accept us.  Both plants that voted to get inroads and pay dues didn't get in, and both are closed as of 2018.  

I watched nightly news of the Caterpillar Strikes of the mid 90s.  Caltrops.  Overturned cars.  Protests.  and in the end they never got anything out of Cat except plant closures in the union states and moving to Texas/non union southern states or overseas.  

I've seen the UAW bend over and take it for Deere in Moline.  

So if that's the ""leadership"" that is running today during a corruption probe?  I don't need to be tied into paying them dues and taking home less."
">it is better to just continue using your ICE car as long as it's somewhat fuel efficient

To my point, why not let someone else use your fuel efficient car and have them replace their less efficient car?  Especially people who are driving 15 year old gas chuggers and cannot afford a new efficient ICE.

If you have the means, trade in an ICE for an EV. Eventually all ICEs will be used, and soon after that, there will be no more ICEs.

Edit: also, that article likes to parade the line about it mattering where your energy comes from as if power sources will not be updated at all in the 10-15 lifetime of your car.

48 produced/hr in Q4 specifically.
"He did, then quickly corrected himself to say ""Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie **10k cars/week**.""

Amusingly, if Tesla did 367k vehicles last year, that's over 7000 a week on average, and if they demonstrated a rate of up to 3000/week from Gigafactory 3, that's pretty spot on. How soon they'll be able to reliably average 3000/week from China remains to be seen, but for a brief moment they demonstrated that production rate.

Edit: Tesla *delivered* 367k vehicles last year. Production was *only* 365,194 vehicles. Still >7k/week average. If we're talking Q4 production, that was >8k/week average."
"That was probably their target delivery **rate** by the end of year, so based on the last quarter or month or so, and extrapolate that to a full year."
"He did.  But that's just a tweet and Elon being Elon.

It's strange to me that we export oil and import oil to use. Why not just truck US to US refineries instead of shipping across the ocean and then trucking it in?
If we're exporting most of our oil than what are *we* using? Checkmate atheists
"It's not about importing or exporting oil. There is one single worldwide price for oil. If enough Americans stop buying gas, there will be a gross worldwide glut of oil, which will cause the worldwide price of oil to crash."
That’s not true at all. Roads and maps are always changing and new features are constantly being developed. It could be used to find discrepancies between the map and what drivers are doing as well as set the tone for car to car communications when full autonomy is available.
"Real Talk: The big place where they spend ”marketing"" dollars is the referral program; free Roadster2's don't grow on trees... (that one probably got away from them a little bit). I am sure they write off a lot of other things as ""marketing"" expenses. The CT event is another good example. They probably managed to claim some write-offs for the Starman launch even though that was his personal car."
Good point. And their physical sales locations (which I know they've cut down on) are sort of a marketing expense as well.
"And they have a website! That’s marketing too! We’re so smart for pointing that out. Upvote please!


/s."
About 150k not comparable really.
How much do you think it cost?
"Marketing Expenses are usually pretty small.

Usually the ad-buy is like 10x the actual budget of the production.   At the low end extremes we might spend $20k on a banner ad's design and production but then the company spends $1m on impressions.  I know Tesla has an in-house production team for video.  But even if you had a $4m/year production team, that's still 0.3% of the money a company like GM spends on air-time."
"They also spend money on advertising lmao, it's all just a crock of BS. Way less than others, but they do spend."
The drive chain in the Tesla will have an oil based lubricant in it anyway.

They owe a lot of roadsters.. but not in the billions of dollars like other car companies spend on TV, etc."
"> The referral program is negligible.

Not really the point, and it is just one example where there is a non-zero cost for marketing activities."
"True.  Just to give some numbers, because, why not?  Tesla is giving out over 80 Roadsters, which comes up to a loss of revenue of $20M."
"That's not really what people consider marketing. If you're making a game then putting up billboards is marketing, making a nice cover isn't."
"Over time they could profit on superchargers. The retail cost per kWh of electricity where I live is around $0.06, and they charge $0.28. There's a lot of investment to recoup, but that's a healthy margin going forward. On average they won't do that well but it may not be a big loss either."
"Mark my words, this will become a profit center in the future."
"Not sure why you are getting downvoted on this - it is a form of marketing, IMO.  It doesn’t matter if they make a profit in the future, it was something they did from the start and you could argue that it’s main purpose is to help sell cars."
Greatly increased capacity? They arent producing less then they are selling and are clearing out inventory cars....
"And it's ""shorts"" who constantly move the goalposts. Ok guys.

And as pointed out repeatedly to the financial illiterates here, capex has nothing to do with profit and loss. You need a new excuse."
Most people dont understand that cash is all that matters. I would like to see their cashflow/cash position excluding the impact of the capital raise earlier in the year.
"They didn't lose money to Capex or growth investment as those two line items are stable if not being decreased.

Tesla and Amazon arent comparable.

Tesla isn't losing money due to reinvestment of profit."
"I've been saying, ""I want to buy a Tesla"" for 3 or 4 years now whenever anyone asks me what I'm going to do when my current car dies.

Anyway q3 & q4 are going to include ramped GF3 and Solar Roof and ramping Model Y, so look out."

"Here's the direct question and answer from 2019 Q2 earnings call if you're interested:

>A.M. Sacconaghi -- Sanford C. Bernstein -- Analyst

>Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you can comment about whether you felt that Q2 benefited from consumers in the US sort of rushing out to buy Model 3 in advance of the declining federal tax credit, a phenomena that you sort of saw in Q4? And part of the reason I ask is, at least by my analysis, it looks like maybe 70% of the Model 3 sold in the quarter were in the US, which is sort of higher than your normalized percentage of US sales. And so do you feel that, that phenomena may have occurred in Q2? And are you still confident that Q3 deliveries can improve sequentially? And beyond the data point that you provided on the call that the orders quarter data better than last quarter, is there anything else you can point to that provides that confidence?

>Elon Musk -- Chief Executive Officer

>Yeah. I think we'll -- demand in Q3 will exceed Q2. It has thus far and I think we'll see some acceleration of that. So -- and then I think Q4 will be, I think very strong. So we expect that quarter-over-quarter improvements. I think Q1 next year will be tough. I think Q3 or 4 will be good, Q1 will be tough. Q2 will be not as bad, but still tough. And then I see like Q3 and Q4 next year will be incredible.

It think he was saying tougher than other specific quarters which we very good. Doesn't meant we'll get a huge loss like last Q1 necessarily.
What?  GF3 CapEx is 1/3 and Model Y is 1/2.
18 months is very generous for Germany. We're trying to build an airport in Berlin since 2006.
"As of now, FSD is illegal in Europe.  Tesla needs time to change this before ramping production of model 3/Y upselling to FSD."
"Only the difference is, it takes just a few weeks to go from ""theoretically capable"" to ""new normal"". It's not like their army of engineers are sitting on their laurels after extrapolating that number."
"Yep, I imagine they stockpiled a bunch of inputs (I'm guessing battery cells are one of the constraints), and went as fast as they could for an hour or two."
"Was in Edinburgh myself earlier this week, saw a fair few."
Thanks for finding that out. Quite a big jump for Volvo in 2018. Perhaps they will take a couple more years to overtake then.
"He means it's going from $1750 to $0, which is a smaller hit than going from $7000 to $3500."
"""Doesn't pay him anything at all"" well he owns a boatload of shares so he's getting a payday if the stock price rises regardless."
"Tesla is far more than a car company. They are very vertically integrated. You need to add the value of most automotive Tier 1 suppliers, automotive dealerships, automotive insurance companies.  And the plan is for all forms of terrestrial transport. That would include shipping, aircraft, trucking…"

"and maybe even a taxi company, like uber, but without drivers"
True breaking point will be after the 1st comercial electric plane or ship
"They even got out of some deals. I liked PayPal Credit financing for Home Depot purchases. I’d be spending >$1000 every time I went there while I was remodeling my house and having a nice 12 month no interest deal was cool. Now SYF offers the same deals via their Home Depot credit card, but then PayPal has **divested** their credit product to SYF, so that’s just as well. These days PayPal is becoming less relevant. There’s Zelle and other bank-backed platforms that actually can’t fuck you over like PayPal does."
I didn’t give any financial advice except to take profits along the way. I’d ask if you know what they say about assumptions but you’ve done a fine job making an ass out of yourself anyway.
"what an utterly stupid and idiotic lie. 

Microsoft shares are currently 150 dollars. If a Honda Civic cost 20,000, in order for that 20,000 to be worth “over a million” he’d have had to have bought and sold them when the shares were 3 dollars. So he cashed out 31 years ago in 1989? 

Fuck out of here, you complete moron 😂"
I hope he’s not investing a lot 🤣
"our electricity prices are luckily also not very much dependent on oil prices but very expensive in general.

Charging the model 3 LR from empty to full once would cost me about 21€ just in raw battery capacity not account for charging losses.

yea in Europe all prices are final and the price also includes all fees they are charging extra."
"i remember last decade during the summer, gas prices were around $5 in Seattle WA.  I end up buying a bicycle to ride to work."
Then your comment is super odd
"Lol, touché"
... what else would cause Tesla to go bankrupt at this point besides lack of demand? They’ve proven they can manage expenses.
oh relax it is a joke.  If it annoys you that much just downvote it and move on.
We bought online as well! Maybe we just got lucky
Just got the car yesterday. Before we were all done I asked them if there was anything going on to compensate people for the missed tax credit because we were told delivery by end of year. They ended up knocking it off the price of the car :)
"Most of my friends see Tesla’s like they see iPhones - new models are getting significant hardware upgrades that call into question the ability to resell after 5-7 years of ownership.  Therefore the lease seems like a less risky option, despite the shitty lease terms."
"It’s not the same service all over North America. Because you have okay service doesn’t mean everybody has okay service. 

It’s not irrelevant. If you don’t have a car and are simply an investor, you’re perspective is that of a keyboard warrior. If you do own a car, then you have more credibility."

Half a car every 43.9 seconds! That belongs in a rehabilitation clinic!
0.0113895216 cars every second! Zany!
"If you take their Q4 production rate of 48/hr and apply it to a whole year, it's not quite 500k. It's... 420k 😏"
"Ah yes I remember now, 10k a week production rate.  He worded it pretty badly though."
Did they publish their monthly numbers? And that’s worldwide right? I wonder how the curve looks...
[deleted]
Not all oil is same and not all oil costs same. US and Canada oil is expensive to produce as they have to squeeze it out of sand. Much more expensive than poking a hole in ground and have it gush out.
It’s cheap for Texas and Louisiana to use domestic oil it’s expensive for places far from pipelines and refineries
"It's absolutely true that the novelty of new data decreases as the amount of data you already have increases. Tesla themselves spent some time talking about novelty at Autonomy Day. 

>Roads and maps are always changing and new features are constantly being developed

Once a certain number of people drive the changed road or drive with the new feature, you've seen all you're going to see. New data will just show you what you already know. 

> It could be used to find discrepancies between the map and what drivers are doing

Again, once you see a certain number of people drive the area where there's a deviation, additional data is no longer novel. 

Basically, look into the law of large numbers."
"Elon Musk has publicly stated that full autonomy in Tesla’s is available now. It’s comments like this that make people not like him, it’s reckless and peoples lives are on the line."
"> free Roadster2's don't grow on trees

To put things in perspective; with **~$15 million** for marketing, one could:

1. Buy a 90-second Superbowl advert slot, or:
2. Cover the *entire* Roadster 2020 referral programme"
That was true.  The current referral program is much smaller than in the past.
"Their free software updates, adding video games like cuphead and standew valley, costs money and ends up in YouTube videos which are basically MARKETING. Nooooooo!"
That’s all they are.
"Tesla was going crazy with that one. If I remember correctly, it's 105 referrals for 2 roadsters. That's just 52-53 referrals per roadsters. I would have set 250 referrals per roadster and that's still generous."
Something like a 1 time $20 million charge which they quickly killed off...
"But the referral program only cost money IF another car is bought and delivered. That's not marketing, that's cost of sales."
"Those referrals did create a lot of sales if the average car price was $40,000 and you needed over 50 referrals thats $2M in sales per free roadster.   So $20M in free cars in exchange for $160M sales referrals isn't going to really hurt the bottom line that bad.  Maybe it should have been 100 to 200 referrals per roadster but even at 50 Tesla isn't going to loose a lot in exchange for the free promotion they got from the program."
So one 30 second Superbowl spot?
"You guys are confusing two terms. Marketing, and Advertising. Tesla doesn't advertise (Billboards, TV Commercials, etc.). They definitely market: Social Media positions, Videos on Youtube, etc."
"They built a complex infrastructure that is not easy to reproduce.   It’s what they call a ‘selling point’ of Tesla and still plays an important role in convincing people to take the plunge into buying a Tesla.  

I expect it will be a ‘break even’ kind of thing on the books, but probably sells lots of cars for the company in the future if they can keep building enough capacity to support the increasing number of Tesla on the road."
Especially if other car companies make deals to use them.  Tesla is set up for some serious success.
"Literally built their third factory.

GF3 in Shanghai.


You know reinvesting all the profits to increase future sakes and therefore profits. Also known as how every single company started up."
"Easy , just subtract the $2.3B cap raise from their delta cash balance start of 2019 ($2B) to start of 2020 ($6B), to see how much they’ve gained, so almost $2B free cash flow in 2019.  And way more in 2020!"
"I trust you're right. The broader thing going on is that they've always made it clear they're targeting growth, and have been attaining it.. and it wouldn't make sense to stop. If they had the additional cash on hand today, they wouldn't be paying out dividends with it - and I might sell my stock if they began to do so."
They’re not comparable because Amazon’s growth rate was pathetic compared to Tesla’s:-)
"Also the more are sold the more people see them and will eventually drive in them, before wanting one too."
"It's weird that they don't list the hard-to-overcome objections like ""There's still no good charging story for most people who live in apartments"" or ""The cheapest ones cost 2/3 of the median household income."""
">  “insert easily overcome objection here"".

For me, it’s loss of range in winter, but the 500 mile cybertruck has eliminated that objection."
"Same here. Also, at this point it no longer makes sense to buy an ICE car, because it will have zero resell value in 10 years. The past year we have seen massive fires in Siberia, the Amazon and Australia. Governments will have to react to."
"> insert easily overcome objection here

for many including myself, it's ... Thirty-plus thousand dollars. Not easily overcome for lots of folks."
"Yep, just got mine to replace my 2004 BMW 325xi. Between massive hail damage 2.5 years ago and having another minor collision over Thanksgiving, I finally cracked.   


I considered a few ICE cars but I just didn't see myself paying $55k for another BMW or $37k for the Subaru WRX, both gas guzzlers.    


The charging situation is really the only drawback. Right now the supercharger network is setup for long trips but it needs to get a little denser so that renters and apartment dwellers can just use superchargers as gas stations.  I'm stuck 20 miles between 3 chargers right now so it's a little annoying waiting for my home charging to be ready."
"Similar experiences here, but what’s crazy is the number of comments of: “wait, you mean it doesn’t use ANY gas?” Somehow people seem to know about them without knowing they are BEVs."
"I think the objections are still pretty valid.  I’m looking to get my garage wired for a Tesla right now and it’s no small feat.  Price and range concerns are valid as well.  That said, I can’t wait to get mine!"
I'm getting one as soon as I have access to a garage or at least off street parking.
"I dunno. I have an order in for a tri.

I am NOT happy with the threads I read detailing how shoddily made the interiors are (see the thread which is about a video on how to fix various rattles and vibrations....completely unacceptable).

And even worse is the feedback I’m seeing regarding customer service. Sounds like a fucking nightmare.

Do I still want my cybertruck? Of course. Has my excitement been tempered by the legion of Tesla owners who are starting to calm down their confirmation bias and start complaining about legitimate problems (that so far have been ignored by Tesla entirely?) Big time."
"He made quite a clear point, if you want proof of teslaq being funded by oil companies there is no proof; one way or the other it is quite clear. 

You can watch 'who killed the electric car' or read that article by that old guy that converts cars to electric, it was a really straight forward explanation."
Have you compared the way in which Tesla is shorted vs other shorted stocks?
"No, any electric car activity is good for Tesla, even if it's competitors selling cars. Teslas biggest opponent is ice cars not other electric cars."
oh shit I didn't realise I was doing my dissertation.    i was just helping the original poster out with a link of how there is oil money put again EVs and climate change denial.
You'd have to unravel all the lobbyist over the years that visited places like the CARB and shitted on everything electric; always up talked systems that weren't feasible /  had massive production/distribution networks  they'd control.
"Your doubt doesn’t matter.  Do the math on energy density and cost improvements and realize it will happen quicker than you forecast.

Have you done this, or are you basing your estimate on feelings?"
"The 4k number is from ARK Invest, who have since updated it to 6k."
Some people see $18k or more 10-12 years from now.  It sounds a bit crazy at first but if they do everything they say they will that's where it's going to be.
Hold them and forget it.
Close your eyes and look back in 5-10 years
"Selling and waiting for a dip to re-buy is a mistake many, many Apple, Amazon, Google investors made.  They sold shares at 100th of what they’re worth today.  As long as Tesla maintains 50% growth rate, the stock will roughly average that kind of growth.  Tesla is an unprecedented buy and hold.  Unless you find a company with more potential, do not sell.

Your temptation comes from the fact that the share price “feels high”.  Don’t invest on feelings.  Invest in companies with great products and great growth rates.  Only sell when those two things are no longer true."
"It is very, very likely those shares will be > $3k each."
"Don’t day trade. I used to and it’s more than a full time job, and I did have a young kid at the time *and* a full time job *and* grad school. I could have really used FSD back then because it was really hard to stay awake. Making good decisions while sleep deprived is very hard. It was taxing.

The worst thing a “young” investor can do is… trade. Don’t do it. It won’t go well in most cases."
"Near Berlin in Germany.
The contract is signed pending board approval from tesla, that's the thing stopping everything from starting right now."
"I'm not really an investor, but based on what Elon is saying does this mean it would be smart to sell off shares now and then rebuy Q3?"
Sure. Easy to come back from a marginal quarterly loss over 4 quarters too.
Growth standpoint. Expanding supercharging network and scaling battery production for grid storage.
"My hometown has been trying to build a highway bypass since I was a kid. I know the feel. However, SpaceX doesn't do that kind of crap. It'll be rushed because they must have it done in time for the real competition to arrive. They know it's coming and need it in 2021 to get a head start."
"Germany also makes 6 million vehicles per year, and 22% of world vehicle exports. The only thing they're better at producing than cars is war criminals."
Model 3 is already the best selling car in the Netherlands by a lot. People like electric cars even without FSD.
What difference does FSD make? People are buying Teslas like crazy even without it.
"Sure, but there's still a certain amount of influence the total removal of incentive is going to have. I think end of 2019 a lot of people don't want to ""miss out"" on the federal incentive."
"That is true, but my point stands.

Elon isn't compensated anything unless Tesla hits $100 billion market cap and maintains it for at least 6 months."
That’s not a payday.  He would profit just as much sitting on a beach.
"In order for Amazon to get to it's current market share every main Street in small town America would have to shutter. Have you seen the state of small town America? They all look like ghost town, now apply the same analogy to transport."
That's why I am saying they need to tackle self-driving next. So that they can charge more.
FINALLY some elementary economics being put to use in here. Thanks!
Tesla doesn’t just sell cars.
"Very possible. I’m overall less optimistic on the FSD product, but I know they’ll eventually get it done. Tesla has a huge potential right now for energy"
"Taking profit along the way is one thing if you're invested in a steadily and slowly increasing stock like Disney.  Telling people to take profits during potentially the largest growth story of the 2020's is profoundly dumb.  Tesla is $450 today, but highly likely to 10x within 3-5 years."
"Riding a bicycle in the summertime, how savage!"
Any threat to the oil supply / increased tension in oil producing regions of the Middle East should improve the prospects of electric car companies.
Huh? Why does Tesla have to go bankrupt? Why are you on about?
"It's stops being a joke when it stops being funny but if you guys STILL find this funny after a year, Have at it :)"
Nice!  I hope you enjoy it!
"Bad logic, I think.  Resale is not just determined by newer Tesla models, but by all used models.  So 3 year old Model 3’s are competing against 3 year old BMW’s... which will look far less attractive in that time.

In addition, if Tesla solves Full Self driving, the value of the cars will rapidly rise and new Teslas may not even be sold to consumers.  Selling one EV robocall-taxi is far more profitable and does far more for the mission.

Tell them to at least put in a $100 reservation on the Cybertruck and select the $7k FSD option to lock in the price, in case Elon’s right.

I know he’s often late, but no matter how preposterous the claim, he’s always right in the end."
"Didn't say it was the same service everywhere or for everyone

Sticking with no sense shutting down production to satisfy some arbitrary level of service satisfaction"
"And for the millions of people who don't live in densely populated cities, going EV is the more environmentally friendly choice."

"420,716 by my calculation. I know it should be rounded up"
he did say at the end of Q4. So factor in Chinese factory and you have 500k
"I don't think they publish monthly numbers, but yes, that is worldwide."
"As best I can determine, Tesla's production numbers for 2019:

* [77,100 from Q1](https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-q1-2019-vehicle-production-deliveries)
* [87,048 from Q2](https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-q2-2019-vehicle-production-deliveries)
* [96,155 from Q3](https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-q3-2019-vehicle-production-deliveries)
* [104,891 from Q4](https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-q4-2019-vehicle-production-deliveries)

In total, 365,194 vehicles produced. So sure, technically lower by 0.6%. Still over 7000/week on average.

Also hey, laying out the number that way, kinda looks like a trend. Production went up 36% between Q1 (under 6000/week) and Q4 (over 8000/week). The numbers are even better than I expected."
"Inventory is effectively zero.  For Tesla, at least right now, the delta between production and deliveries is nothing more than delivery logistics."
"You realize that can only happen to a very limited extent, right? You can't sell more than you make forever."
"They carry over inventory between quarters because cars take time to transport and deliver. Its not nearly as bad as you're making it sound. Its not as if they're selling cars they made 6-12 months ago. Its more like selling a car in January that was made in December, so in Q1 reports that car shows up in sales but not in production."
Sources?
"Sure, but isnt the price of oil set by the market? Saudia Arabia just makes more per barrel than Alberta. So if price of oil is the same, wouldnt it be cheaper for a US refinery to buy domestically than ship from overseas?"
"Built into the cost is also workers/human rights and such, not *just* that it's harder to get into a usable form."
"I have no clue what you’re talking about. Full autonomy may be ready for basic use but without it being used practically at a large scale, nobody knows how good it’s going to be. 

To make it better, driver data needs to be analyzed and the product will have to be optimized. 

My comment has nothing negative to do with Musk. In fact it’s praising their efforts as a software company by using collected data to make their product better over time. More so than any other car manufacturer."
"Yup. But, I’ve had my model 3 for 3 months and still haven’t consumed my 1500km of free referral charging. On the other hand, I’ll use Ionity for big charges if possible since they have a flat rate of €8, while Tesla charges €0.17 at the Supercharger here in Norway. Break even is 47kWh. 

On my way home for Christmas I charged 48,3 kWh in 26 minutes, averaging 111kW, with a 180kW peak at an Ionity station. From ~20% to 79%."
"Pff. And they even put the car brand on the car, too. That’s marketing! What fucking losers.

/s

You people are so desperate for an argument it’s laughable."
"Meh, that's just product development.  It's no different than any other interior nice-to-have feature (e.g. heated seats) that isn't strictly necessary for driving but that adds a selling point."
[deleted]
"You are splitting hairs.  And I can’t understand why everyone seems so hell bent on asserting that Tesla spends no money on advertising or marketing.  
But if you want to get technical, the referral rewards are only incurred when a sale is made, but it is a program, which needs planning, budgeting, and personnel to implement it - all which cost money.

TESLA SPENDS MONEY ON MARKETING!!!!!  Just not on traditional media advertising."
Also the people with 50 to 100 referrals are mostly youtubers/ tesla enthusiasts exactly the kind of people you want hyping up your flagship car.
"I wasn't suggesting they lost money.  I was putting the cost of marketing via free cars in perspective.  Advertising usually costs money, but more than pays for itself in revenue, just as giving out 80 free Roadsters did."
You're assuming all referral sales wouldn't have happened otherwise.
Plus all the promotion as YouTubers begin taking delivery.
"Yep. 

The big worries of people thinking about getting their first EV is general range and ability to charge on ‘road trips’.   Even if most people don’t do big road trips, lots of people want the fancy new car to be able to. North America is fricking big, and building a charging infrastructure takes real effort.  

Car makers, other than Tesla, have dropped the ball on actually building the needed infrastructure to support the cars that they sell.  

Until North American EV infrastructure is really built out by reliable 3rd parties, the supercharger network will be a massive asset to Tesla that they gave a big head start in."
"Tesla hasn't made a yearly profit or year over year positive cash flow. They aren't making an annual profit to invest, period.

What you say is false because of that alone. Tesla posts their fincials.

Secondly we know their capex numbers, they don't come from profit, and they are stable if not decreasing and are very low.

Finally and most importantly.

GF3 in Shanghai was LITERALLY BUILT FROM CHINESE LOANS. Tesla borrowed money to build it.

Not from Capex or profits but debt.

https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-enters-loan-agreement-chinese-banks-to-fund-new-gigafactory-2019-3

>You know reinvesting all the profits to increase future sakes and therefore profits. Also known as how every single company started up.

You need to do some basic research before you make stupid claims that Tesla themselves disprove."
"Yes the math is easy, just need to know the 2020 cash balance.

Knowing the change in working capital would be nice too."
"This is my dad. When the model S came out I was like "" super intrigued."" and he was all ""ehhhhhh"" about it. Althrn a family friend bought one and my dad rode in it and when he came home all he could talk about was tesla"
"Yep, until 2018 I had literally only seen one Tesla in my town and that was only because I was in a more expensive area, now sometimes I’ll see 2 or 3 in a single day."
"It's true that people making the median home income aren't buying new Teslas, but to be fair they aren't buying new beamers either.  Eventually used model 3s will be on the market for more reasonable prices as they age."
"Winter range loss is severe on short trips as it takes a lot of energy to initially warm the battery pack and the cabin.  On long trips where it’s most important, it’s only about 25%."
"That's true. However, by the time I'm ready to buy the used market for Model 3s should be starting to fill out. I don't need a brand new one as long as everything checks out."
"See what a quote would be for getting an rev outlet. And then use the cable that comes with the car. It’s just as good, and it will work for your friends leaf or bmw when they need a charge for their lesser car"

My point is that you can't/shouldn't present information from a biased source as trustworthy.  Isn't that obvious?  There's a conflict of interest.
"No I haven’t done the math, but specific to autos how many years/replacement cycles will it take to transition? Ballpark, every ICE car sold in 2020 will be on the road for 11 years or more. 95+% of cars sold told are ICE. It’s going to take several replacement cycles to convert the auto fleet to electric. Let alone other modes of transport.

Don’t get me wrong I think EVs are great but you won’t replace ICE overnight even with meaningful improvements in density. 

Now let’s talk about transitioning the military to EVs. Not going to happen, hence my statement that oil won’t go away."
I remember predicting $5k per share about 5 years back and everyone in the sub thought I was mad haha :)
Kind of also from Elon because his maximum bonus package will be granted when the company reached 10x which is roughly 3.5k.
[deleted]
"$18k (and almost any number over $2k) is only possible with FSD working without human intervention for 99.99% of trips.  If that happens, the revenue from taxi service will be amazing.  Also society would undergo rapid change."

I agree Supercharger V3 will ramp rapidly.  Battery cell scaling is the big unknown and could definitely affect profit.
lmao
"Netherlands just had a lot of 2020 demand pulled forward because of a large increase on Model 3 taxes 3 days ago.  1st half of 2020 will be rough, but 2nd half will pick right back up again, because there’s another large tax increase in 2021.

On the plus side, the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Germany all have new incentives coming."
"People like to pay just 80 euros a month tax for being allowed to drive a company car as a private car too, that's the whole 'scheme' here. Similar regulations caused a massive PHEV boom around 2014 (especially for the Mitsubishi Outlander) until controversy ensued that most people were driving their car on fuel only as companies didn't tend to also provide a charging subscription (as there was no incentive/regulation on that too). The percentage of non-lease EV's in the Netherlands is very low, and is only just starting to grow. People will like EV's eventually but this boom isn't related to that much, altough the benefits still stand that a fairly large group of BEV's (regardless of their motivations) will have positive side effects on things like charging infrastructure demand, which is of course why the incentives are there."
">What difference does FSD make?

About $3-4k in pure profit per car. Takes a bit of the sting out of building a new factory."
what's the expected tesla share price at $100 billion market cap?
[deleted]
"You can't just charge more and expect no change in demand.  
Having a monopoly on working FSD, but at a high price, would just drive people to buy a competitor's offering without FSD if that's what their budget can afford.  
If you try and bring in a government-backed requirement for FSD, your monopoly will have public push-back on price gouging and probably be mandated into worse profit than keeping competition alive."
You’re clearly new to this. Good luck.
wasn't bad in Seattle.
The professor believes Tesla is going bankrupt.
I guess we are all just idiots who find demand jokes funny.   Still like to laugh at a fart joke too so maybe that is the reason we are so unintelligent.
"I didn’t say shutdown production, I said put more emphasis on customer service for those of us who have a car already. Let’s be clear: Tesla needs to produce cars. But _just as important_ they need to support those customers and cars with the same level."
This is very true.
"104891 vehicles produced in Q4. Multiply by 4 and you get 419,564 from Fremont. Which would round up to 420k."
"Yes, that correct for the annualised at end-of-2019.

Now for 2020, one can factor in **Model Y**, and it's a heck of a lot more—built on *additional* production lines—and possibly beats the +3.3% month-on-month / +50% year-on-year that Tesla has been sustaining; …but everything depends on the battery cells.

^(*edit:* +years and battery cells for additional clarity)"
"I’m thinking with all the production coming online if you extrapolate Q4 numbers we could be seeing ridiculous growth in 2020. I’m just excited for the company to be finally hitting its stride. Hopefully we’ll see some growth across the sectors (like their **fucking service department** haha :D). 

Here’s to 2020!"
yup which may become a problem for Tesla
"Source?

The article this thread links to is the source.. 

You're literally commenting on the thread with the information you need. Production is lower than deliveries.

Just click on the link for this thread. It even has a nice table."
"There are tons of different grades of oil.  US refineries were built with expensive equipment to handle heavy sour crude, which is cheaper per barrel.  Shale oil is light and sweet, and easy to refine.....this means it’s a more expensive per barrel because more refineries can process it.

Therefore, US oil is sold globally at the higher price while US refineries buy cheap heavy crude because they already invested in the expensive equipment to refine it.  Other nations are willing to pay more for shale oil because they haven’t yet invested in the tech to refine heavy sour."
[deleted]
u/TylerHobbit was probably joking...
i mean of course that’s marketing. it still cool tesla doesn’t need ads.
"What do you mean, “you people”?!"
And they also make sense in terms of driving amenity for a Tesla since you aren't gonna be driving anymore(Soon). Need something to do while in traffic.
"That was the point. They were looking for free advertising through the channels that their customers use. Aka EV blogs and YouTube like you said.

Far from free though as all those roadsters are going to cost them."
"1) You pivoted from your original point, which was that they weren’t substantially increasing capacity.  Does that mean you understand you were wrong and just chose not to reply?

2) it’s irrelevant that loans help finance GF3.  GF3 still greatly increases capacity.  GF3 is not really a car factory.  It is a money printing machine! 1st phase will already be spinning off $1.3B annual gross profit on a $2B investment.   Ummm, borrowing at 4% or so to generate 60% return is a no-brainer, right?  And if you think Tesla is pausing at that level of gross profit generation (150k cars / year), then I don’t know what to tell you.  

3) The most amazing aspect of Tesla’s financials is that they just passed the point where gross profits cover ALL of the company’s Operating Expenses, and Operating Expenses don’t need to grow much this year.  I.e. 80% or more of upcoming gross profit increases on GF3, Model Y, Solar Roof and Megapacks flow directly through to net profit.  This might be the single largest factor that shorts, who only look at past balance sheets, miss.  If I were a short, I would literally be shaking in my boots over what 2020 second half portends."
Just keep it plugged in and it'll be fine.
"That's another issue. If you purchase a five-year-old Tesla, how long until you have to replace the battery? They cost like $5,000 right now.  That's easily two-three years worth of repairs on a gas vehicle.

"Personally, I don't agree; if you join the dots you can see the picture.

"Split probably.  Dividend and buyback, almost certainly not for decades.  Elon and his cofounder from PayPal, Peter Thiel, are fond of saying that dividends are a symptom of a lack of innovation and a sign the company has nothing worth spending money on.  Transitioning the world to sustainable energy will take trillions of investment.  It's not Elon's MO to make enterprise level profits, those profits will all be reinvested in future growth.  It will be like Apple, once it hits a crazy market cap and brings in the equivalent of Tim Cook to replace Elon it will start to take the foot off the gas and turn to a dividend/buyback type stock but that's likely decades away."
"Right, but it would be as-if you bought now and held to a higher price."

"I would view it as gambling on not losing $1,000’s per share, in order to make $25 / share.

My thesis is that Tesla is a technological juggernaut with many, many advantages competing against legacy companies with very many handicaps.  Therefore the odds are very high the company will grow ver, very rapidly, and the share price will on average grow very rapidly.  So buy and hold long term is a bet on Tesla the company.

By waiting for a dip, you are basing your decision on a “hunch” that the stock will dip below its current price.  Your bet is that you have some innate understanding of short term market psychology and that trends will continue as they have, that the short rally will not continue, that the earnings report will not surprise, that Tesla does not shock Wall St. by announcing they’re already selling 1k Solar Roofs / week and ramping to 5k roofs...

Even if there is a 90% chance your hunch is correct, it is still a bad bet, because you’re risking $1,000’s per share to make $25.00 for each share."
"These countries are very small which makes their embrace of BEV's very exciting. Within a decade, we'll be able to see what a society looks like that uses mostly electric cars.

"he was saying production rate at the end of Q4 2019. While there was chinese factory producing at the end of Q4, there were (almost) none Model Y at the end of Q4 2019"
why would it be a problem? You just put more cars into the backlog. People will choose to wait or not.
They just opened a new factory to handle their 2nd biggest market. Shouldn't be a problem at all.
"You said ""They didn't produce the cars sold in these **quarters**"". Quarters plural. 

The article gives Q4 production and delivery numbers, as well as deliveries for all of 2019. It does not give production numbers for Q1-Q3. From the linked information, at best it can be argued that Q4 deliveries exceeded production. It does not back up your assertion. Indeed, Q1 production dramatically exceeded deliveries.

As I outlined in my other comment, if we look at the entire year, Tesla's production was within 1% of its deliveries. So you're technically correct for 3 of the 4 last quarters, and technically correct for the 2019 totals, but ultimately the difference is negligible and if I were to use production numbers rather than delivery numbers, it does not change any of my conclusions."
">If we couldn't import any oil, we'd have pretty nasty gasoline shortages and price jumps for a while

"The Tesla warranty on the battery pack is 8 years so you'd have at least three years left on that.

As far as how long the pack will last based on mileage, that's going to depend on each battery pack. So far, there haven't been many reports of the packs going out early (bar catastrphic defects  covered under warranty). One source I found said that a Model S still had 90% battery after 186k miles. 

If I could get to 250k before needing a replacement, I'd call that a win. Especially since you don't have to pay for a lot of the maintenance and failures that might occur in an ICE vehicle (oil changes, transmission, even brakes last much much longer)."

That really depends though. Because if the self driving car thing does really take off then people will need much less cars total.
Companies will often initiate buy backs if they see the stock as undervalues.  An important caveat here is that they have the cash to do so.
"Fundamentally though, dividends are the only real “payoff” you get for investing in a stock. They are a share of the profits. Of course the stock price may go up, but only because the next person you sell it to expects it to go up, and the next person, and so on. The market cannot just be an endless chain of speculation on stock price. At the core, there would be no reason to buy a stock if there were no dividends."

"because being supply constrained isn't a good long term problem to have...

it doesn't matter right now because if they make too many in a quarter it gets sold in another.

eventually you will need to expand properly."
"I didn't know what the SPR was. So I googled it. It's the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is basically a place we can store 713 millions barrels of crude oil to support disruptions in productions, as well and sell it at higher prices.

My math has 713 million barrels of oil being worth $44.9 billion."
"Because it has been since proven wrong. I understand that you think innocent until proven guilty but I think that the system it's exploited everyday to cater to their needs and the stakes are too high now. They managed to shut down electric cars in the past like they did when they bought that battery patent and locked it up so nobody could use it. It is simply too much, they play with the air we breathe and it is just necessary to say aloud what they are and what they do."
"Yes, and Tesla could be one day as well :)

And actually the share price would need to be over 8k/sh for a $1T market cap assuming no new shares"
"Well, they might not buy a tesla, but they will still use it as a robotaxi, and that will earn tesla more in the long run."
"Elon has super voting stock and he has a large group of friendlies like Ellison (who has 3m shares) that are likely to vote in his favor as long as he is at the helm.  So I think the short term will go that route but long term I don't disagree it is possible.  It was a big battle at Apple that took years until after Jobs left.

I think it was Bezos who said you can be a dividend paying stock, you can be a growth stock, you can be a buy and hold stock, you just need to make sure your investors are aligned with what kind of a company you want to be.  If you look at some of Elon's comments on earnings calls in 2018 he made brash comments about not trying to convince people to buy his stock.  They seemed odd on their own but if you look at it as aligning his stakeholders with his vision (even if it meant a lower stock price at the time) then it starts to make a lot of sense."
"It depends.  Shareholders like dividends from income stocks that are supposed to pay dividends.  For growth stocks, this usually is not a factor."
Incorrect.  Being supply constrained is a GREAT problem to have.  I think you’re confusing it with being demand constrained (which is a bad problem to have and one that EVERY OTHER auto manufacturer suffers).
"Like, say, building a factory in China and another one in Germany???"
"They’ve been supply constrained for 5 years at this point. Not a big problem to have compared to demand constrained. 

Either way you are looking at the numbers a bit incorrectly. Tesla can play a lot of games with the delivery/production ratio based on where it is shipping vehicles. The real concern would be if Tesla was stockpiling cars. Then they have a huge profit sink in the unsold inventory. That isn’t happening. Nothing to worry about."

What happens if they split the stock? Would they ever split it?
"> Elon has super voting stock

As far as I can tell there's only 1 class of stock (i.e. no super-voting stock like Alphabet/Google with class A, B, C etc)."
I'm not familiar with us laws bit probably it would be a crime so we would know about. I can't provide proof as I said.
"Typically companies split their stock when the price per share exceeds the price point of their target investor.  Most investors like stocks less than 500 a share.  Back in the day, I owned Harley Davison stock and it would typically when it rose over $50.  Other stocks, like Berkshire Hathaway, they let rise into the thousands, as their investors are typically more sophisticated and wealthy, so the price per share does not bother them as much.

There seem to be a lot of Tesla investors that buy just a few shares at a time.  So for this reason (if their numbers are significant), they may split it to keep the price/share under $500."
"Depends. Splitting would probably entice more retail investors because 8k/sh is a lot for anyone who isn't running an investment bank. Unless fractional shares really start to catch on, which I suppose they will."
"Sorry, I think you're right.  There is a supermajority approval right which grants Elon, as a major holder an effective veto right as his vote is needed to adopt certain actions, which is not the same as supervoting stock."
Gotcha. Thanks for the insight.
"> While accidents caused by a mistaken press of the accelerator pedal have been alleged for nearly every make/model of vehicle on the road, the accelerator pedals in Model S, X and 3 vehicles have two independent position sensors, and if there is any error, the system defaults to cut off motor torque. Likewise, applying the brake pedal simultaneously with the accelerator pedal will override the accelerator pedal input and cut off motor torque, and regardless of the torque, sustained braking will stop the car. Unique to Tesla, we also use the Autopilot sensor suite to help distinguish potential pedal misapplications and cut torque to mitigate or prevent accidents when we’re confident the driver’s input was unintentional. Each system is independent and records data, so we can examine exactly what happened.

Solid response!"
I'm glad Tesla addressed that bogus claim.
[deleted]
"I for one can confirm, that my Tesla accelerates exactly as intended... which is to say, immediately."
Lol can you believe the balls on Brian Sparks? Trying to push some BS petition to recall *every single* Tesla vehicle on the road? He could’ve been more realistic and tried to go after just a subset 😂😂
100% written by Elon lol
"None of this is new but nice to see clearly described and stated.  
Still won stop the short seller BS :/"
"Malcolm Gladwell's podcast did a whole episode on ""unintended acceleration"" a while back which did a great job of completely debunking the supposed phenomenon while also explaining what factors lead to it happening.

While it doesn't mention Teslas specifically, he does mention that it's much more likely to happen when there is no idle/creep (as is the case with any Tesla that doesn't have creep mode enabled) because when you're parking the car you're pressing on the accelerator pedal when you would otherwise be pressing on the brake pedal (and thus if you're not thinking and think your foot is on the brake, there is the greater possibility of pressing down on it instinctively).

Anyway here's the link:

[http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/08-blame-game](http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/08-blame-game)"
This is like at work when people say crazy things happen (of course they are never at fault). A quick review of the actual data always tells the truth (the people are usually at fault).
"No surprises here, adding to my TSLA position on these fakes claims from the shorts. Thanks shorts for the artificial share price suppression over the years and all your billions of dollars flowing into our accounts."
My Tesla accelerates unintentionally faster than I anticipate... And I like it.
"BIG F'N SURPRISE. 

&#x200B;

Sorry for yelling, but its soooo stupid that these completely false headlines deserve any time of day. Fuck just realized, I'm getting worked up over this very thing, which means they may have won this one."
"It sounds like what they're saying is ""In all of our models, if there is any doubt, the car shuts off the motor.""

Which makes sense. Push two pedals, assume you want brake. Getting different info from the two petal sensors? Don't accelerate.

Just the fact that if you are pushing on the brake and gas, it cuts the motor, that's proof enough. So if you felt undesired acceleration, pushing the brake should stop you no matter what.

And the best part of this is that the Teslas are in a unique position to provide a suite of sensor and camera black box data in each crash.

--------------

Look. Here's the thing. We're all human. And we all have our own computers that can malfunction too - but those computers don't have black boxes. Given the number of claims here versus the number of miles driven per day, it seems perfectly reasonable to chalk this up to driver error.

But if Tesla really wanted to put it to bed, they could install an inferred camera that looks at the driver's feet on a few hundred cars - and prove that accelerator == acceleration."
"Just a FYI nearly every ""eThrottle"" on any car made in the last 20 years has two sensors in it, and goes into ""limp/no throttle"" mode if they don't agree."
"Tesla: ""Sit the fuck down""."
What’s a short seller?
"Yes, drivers can mistakenly press accelerator instead of brake in panic. I think the more likely scenario for unintended acceleration is if Autopilot does not recognize an obstacle or vehicle and accelerates to resume preset speed.

Again, that should be able to traced from logs."
WHAT NOW JIM CHANOS? WHAT NOW MARK B SPIEGEL? IS IT PEE PEE PANTS TIME!?!?!?!?
">is completely false and was brought by a Tesla short-seller.

Serious question, if this is the case, why isnt Tesla taking this to the courts?"
"Smack down! I mean, this was expected to be the case, but good to see Tesla getting out ahead of this short storm."
Some people are too dumb to drive.
I'm still convinced this is people disengaging AP but not cruise control by turning the wheel.... Any proof that it isn't?
"There's a ""chill"" mode for people that don't know the difference between the brake and accelerator pedal. But I always thought these people should NOT be driving."
I can’t even imagine trying to slander Elon like this. The man is innovating everything he touches just sit back and let him do it!
Tesla shorts can go suck it.
"Its the shorters @500, that all"
Mic drop.
">the Autopilot sensor suite to help distinguish potential pedal  misapplications and cut torque to mitigate or prevent accidents when  we’re confident the driver’s input was unintentional 

Sure wish that worked for me when I accidentaly stepped on the accelerator while trying to pay for a thing and almost slammed the car into the barrier, but that's just me being a dumbass"
"Lol you can tell they're annoyed.

  


But ABC news faithfully carried the story as if it was a fact.

  


Brought to you by our ICE sponsors."
"Why do I feel like the media and establishment have some sort of ""beef"" or ""agenda"" against Tesla?  For how much they push climate awareness it's like they are anti the company making the biggest difference....  It's odd to me."
Now the stock will just go up faster without the shorts asking it to.
"I’ve wondered is this unintended acceleration the same thing as the car going on the wrong direction?

I’ve seen about 3 posts about people believing their car is in reverse and the car goes forward instead. Most of these accounts admit they were tired or sleepy, but one claims they were fully awake and on a hill."
"Stupidly vague claim in the first place, and with the bogus number of complaints it would have amounted to half or a third of owners were seeing this issue."
"Not related, but could these multiple checks cause phantom braking?"
Booyah son!
Hope the short seller gets nailed for fraudulent claims 👍
Solid response! It seems every incident like this is always caused by human error every single time.
Did everyone hear the mic drop?
"We don’t even own a Tesla and my husband and I called BS when we saw these “accusations “.  

Tsk tsk, not being very subtle about it."
Short seller who caused this should go to jail.
Everyone gave me shit when I said dark forces are trying to bring Tesla down!
"As soon as I heard this on the radio business report - ""anonymous complaint about runaway acceleration in Teslas"" my first though was that it had to be Tesla Shorts.  If there were that many complaints, no way the NTSB would *not* investigate for a common thread. The commentator described one guy complaining he took a U-turn and the car suddenly took off. My guess, he was on (adaptive) cruise control and behind another left-turning car. As soon as he turned enough that there was no obstructing car in front, the cruise control tried to get him up to full speed."
I was leaving Publix the other day and in 2.6s I ended up in a McDonald's drive through window. All I did was hit the brake pedal and it went to the floor. Tesla is at fault /s
"I genuinely don't understand most of the comments in this thread. Yes, I read the response, which essentially boils down to: ""We know we didn't make a mistake because we checked it out and we found that we didn't."" Depending on your opinion of Tesla, you will either view this as vindication or extreme naivety––certainly not conclusive evidence on either side.

""We are transparent with NHTSA"" =/= ""Outside bodies have also audited every complaint and have also found no mistakes.""

My M3 is the best car I've ever owned FYI, which I guess I'm obligated to say to ensure my comment doesn't end up at the bottom. Am I missing something here?"
"Come on, even my 2006 ICE car has two potentiometers on accelerator, and sensor disagreement means no throttle - and people still push the ""car accelerated all by itself"".

I had experienced ""sudden unintended acceleration"" several times, and 2/3 of the cases car was not at fault :

1. (IIRC) Peugeot 405 - hardware defect, stuck accelerator cable
2. Citroen Xsara - aftermarket floor mats made pedal stuck
3. hacking cruise control to my 2006 Grand Vitara.

1 and 2) were easily fixed by pressing clutch, killing the engine and fixing the underlying issue. In 3, I just had to short two wires :)

Not to mention both 1) and 2) did not cause the car to accelerate suddenly, but it ""merely"" kept accelerating after I released the pedal.

That's the thing I really like about manual transmission cars - you press a pedal, and no matter what is fucked up in the car systems, you'll always (well, almost always) disconnect the engine from the wheels."
Good DAY!
"*This is what happens when the shit at wsb becomes more mainstream, retards going full retard.*"
Sweet!
In every case.
All these attempts to desperately bring down Tesla are embarrassing. I only laugh when I see something like it. Why are they still even trying? Is there some1 who will still actualy believe to it?
How does Autopilot determine pedal misapplication?

"This shit doesn't happen to limited companies, close it Elon"
Official response to Batterygate and Chargegate please
"I drive a model S and moved into a new house few months ago. The garage is super tight and I learned what happens when you’re really close to something (going extremely low speed) but you accelerate, the car does indeed stop. I still had space but if I had pressed the gas too hard, too much, I definitely would have hit."
"Ah, the FAKE OUTRAGE media at it again."
When will the short sellers be jailed for market manipulation?
"I dont own a Tesla, but reading these type of news, why do people try to put down Tesla ? Other car manufacturers have been involved in shady businesses practices and yet somehow Tesla gets the burn for providing a safe car that is constantly being improved. Is it jealously ? Greed ? Selfishness ? Courts should start punishing people who create and give false information."
"I know 3 people who have crashed their cars by doing this. One drove into a Walmart. They all claimed it's their car's fault and swear up and down that they were stomping on the brakes, not the gas. I'd believe them more if they said they weren't pressing anything. They were stomping on the gas."
"> ""Likewise, applying the brake pedal simultaneously with the accelerator pedal will override the accelerator pedal input and cut off motor torque, and regardless of the torque, sustained braking will stop the car.""

I didn't know that Tesla did this. Do any other cars have this feature? It seems obvious that when the brake is applied there is no reason for the accelerator to be pressed."
"Welp, I'm embarrassed to say I had my first unintended acceleration yesterday. BUT to the best of my knowledge this was totally my fault. I am also really surprised how easy it was to do! If correct my speculated cause has nothing to do with pedals.

I was in a parking lot and started to back into a charger spot and then noticed it was reserved (charge point, not tesla). I run in hold mode so the car stopped when with no acceleration.  A car was approaching so I sat waiting for it to pass. Since I was stopped I pushed the right stick down to shift into drive and the car started moving!!! It started slowly but it was moving and this made no sense.  In complete surprise I remained calm and trying diagnose why the car was moving on its own. I didn't have long, what started at a slugs pace picked up quickly. I only had a moment or two as I was approaching a parking lot crosswalk with pedestrians. I just stepped on the brake and then tried to figure out what just happened.

I don't know exactly what happened but I believe this is what happened and it makes sense... To the beset of my knowledge I'll assume I had already put the car into drive while in hold mode while waiting for the car to cross my path. When the car passed I ""shifted into drive"" to pull out, But if already in drive this would have accidentally enabled ACC so the car would start moving. I have no proof this is what happened.  I believe this is what happened and it makes sense."
Is the first sentence in the Tesla response missing a word?
"Tesla is better than most manufacturers, but there is a fundamental problem with how we control cars.

How to accelerate:  Press your foot down on a pedal.  
How to decelerate:  Press your foot down on a pedal.

Those should not be identical actions!  The only difference is where the foot is, and proprioception alone is not accurate enough in an emergency.

So, change one of the two to anything else.  Anything else is better than what we have, but here are a couple ideas:

* Keep your foot on the brake pedal, but pull it back instead of pressing down to accelerate.  
* Use a hand control for either braking or accelerating."
"> This petition is completely false and was brought by a Tesla short-seller.

*SOUR GRAPES!*"
Wtf is with these short sellers? Why don't they just go get fucked? I don't know the first thing about investing but I have read around here that they're a super sour lot.
"It is interesting how every person who speaks against Tesla gets down voted. I think we should keep an open mind about possibility that Tesla is wrong. 
I personally own a model 3 perf and I love the car. But I am 100% sure that I have been in more than a couple of instances where the car accelerated by itself. Thankfully, I was alert and hit breaks in time before something bad happened. 
I am not saying that all the cases where people claimed that accidents are because of unintended acceleration are legit. But as a person who experienced this bug, I can tell that this is happening and Tesla needs to take it more seriously and fix the bug."
"I have to admit that my ""unintended acceleration"" was caused by me not being used to one pedal driving so when I suddenly have to come to a complete stop, I instinctively stomp on the pedal that my foot is on. On teslas, that just happens to be the accelerator pedal.

I'm not ashamed to say that this happened twice since I started owning my tesla. Luckily, nothing bad had happened and I quickly realized my mistake and switched to the break pedal.

I can totally imagine that this is what happened to people whom claim that teslas have unintentionally accelerated but did not want to admit fault."
"Very interesting, I'm going to ask them if they can pull data from my car. I have a specific date/time/location.

EDIT: You guys need to calm down, 12 downvotes for wanting to ask Tesla to see if anything seems odd about my car and you guys go on the attack. I'm not even being hostile about it I was just going to the maker themselves to see if it was abnormal, and so they could have data to fix. Good lord people, this sub has gone off the rails. If they pull the data and say, your foot was on the pedal, then that's the end of it. If they say otherwise they can look at my data and figure out a fix."
I find it hard to believe that someone with hundreds of thousands if not millions of  dollars heck their own bankruptcy even on the line would stoop this low..... /s.

I do really appreciate Tesla’s no-BS responses to these kinds of things. Most other companies spin it somehow or use vague language to cloud the issue.

"Auto mechanic here. Pretty much every drive by wire car for the last, almost, two decades uses a similar system. Minus the autopilot stuff that is. I've been working on all manner of drive by wire systems for years. Never seen a legit unintended acceleration."
Also cool to learn there are two sensors on the accelerator pedal.
"What they don't mention is that most of these cases claim the driver was hitting the brake pedal. In addition to the acceleration pedal, there is also a brake sensor, which would record whether the brake was applied. So you would not only need to have 2 independent acceleration sensors be wrong, you'd also need the brake sensor to be reporting incorrectly in order to support such a claim. 

At some point they should just stick a camera in the footwell."
Eat that clumsy people trying to bankrupt Tesla!
It’s hard to argue against science
"I wonder if track mode allows brake and accelerator simultaneously. Left foot brake, anyone?"
"Malcolm Gladwell did an episode of Revisionist History on this. 

https://blog.simonsays.ai/blame-game-with-malcolm-gladwell-e8-s1-revisionist-history-podcast-transcript-b4b5eb874cae

turns out pretty much every time it's just the person flipping out and hitting the gas instead of the brake."
Dang that's a beast response.  True to Elon's word that safety is the number 1 priority.
"It is a solid response. But having a really bad experience with FCA, I have doubts when the company says the car doesn’t have a problem.

My Jeep has rain detection(or whatever its called in english) to wipe the windshield automatically. Pretty standard in the US i would imagine. Anyways, it sometimes wipes the windshield when its not supposed to (i.e sunny days). I took it several times to the dealership and all they do is scan with a computer to have no error logged. So they give the car back to me and tell me there is nothing wrong with the car. One time I even RECORDED several ocassions where it happens, making sure the position of the lever and the windshield sensor both are shown in the video, but since it never happened while the car was with them, they say there is nothing they can do, they car is perfectly fine.

The thing is, sometimes it happens 2-10 times in a row for a few days straight, sometimes it takes 2-3 weeks to happen ONCE.

Aside from other problems of course. Nonetheless, I am taking them to court to get my money back. The car is a bug on wheels."
"What I don’t understand though, why doesn’t the car detect that something is in front, like a wall and just not let the car accelerate towards the obstacle? 

From what I’ve seen, Subaru’s eyesight won’t let you run into an object until you press the accelerator several times."
"Yes it's illegal, but unlikely action will be taken. Although I encourage you file a complaint with the SEC: https://www.sec.gov/tcr

The short seller's identity is clearly available, you can mention them directly.

They definitely won't do anything without direct complaints from shareholders."
"The SEC does not care about ""short and distort"", although it is illegal..."
SEC only cares about Elon was too right on predicting the price. lol
"I think legal action can only apply here if they could prove that the allegations are presented for the sole purpose to negatively effect the stock price. Basically meaning all the claims are false and they know it. I fully believe most of the actual clients making the claim believe it wasn't their fault. 

We also publically know the person behind it, and that he is short, thus he isnt trying to hide anything. That would make this very improbable for SEC investigation."
Probably a /r/wallstreetbets poster...
"Just like Bill Ackman’s public attack on herbalife? He publicly said it was a scam. Made multiple videos, was able to get on multiple news outlets and wrote many opinion pieces about how Herbalife was a scam all the while having a massive short position. The sec did nothing. 

Ackman conceded defeat and lost like one billion of investors money with his short."
So in that case a certain somebody with the last name Sparks should be seeing some slaps on the wrist like Elon did for securities fraud. Right?
Can people without inside information do illegal market manipulation?   Isn’t that just freedom of speech?
Lol
You mean the Shortseller Enrichment Commission?
"If a short seller is losing millions (billions?), they don’t give a shit...it’s worth it if they can reverse the trend."
Yup. Every acceleration my car has experienced has been very much intentional.
"Pretty sure this is the majority of supposed SUA complaints.    Coupled with creep mode being off, people aren't used to hitting the pedal to slowly move forward, and screw it up."
"Back to the future!

Because is goes really fast immediately, get it?"
He'd be in jail if the SEC wasn't corrupt. He did it because he knows they are.
"Yup, I could hear him at the opening line."
"Honestly, part of the problem here is stories like this just cause more stories of 'unintended acceleration' to pop up, either from the confused, or as an excuse for accidents.

Back when Toyota unintended acceleration stories were a thing there was one somewhat famous 'unintended acceleration' story that popped up after the media was already talking about. A woman was backing out of her driveway, and drove full force into the fence of the neighbor across the street. She blamed it on her Toyota Prius accelerating unintentionally, but a police investigation determined that she slammed hard on the accelerator (and likely mixed it and the brakes up).

And then there's some people who engage in showmanship for other reasons. There was a guy who claimed his Prius was unintentionally accelerating rapidly on the high way, who in a 15 minute 'police chase' managed to 'stop' it and swore he'd never drive another Prius again. It got a bunch of headlines at the time as another example of the accelerating Prius. But then Toyota & government investigators determined that the guy was full of BS after studying the car. 

I'm not saying there were definitely zero true cases of unintended acceleration with the Prius back then (it's the car I drove back then, and still drive today), but a lot of the cases that came up after it started getting media attention weren't real problems with the car."
Also any mode on Tesla can be correlated with going from manual to automatic gear box or the other way which debunks the complaints about it acting differently than other cars.
This episode was the first thing that came to mind when I heard about that claim.
"As a non-Tesla owner, is creep mode enabled by default? Seems like it should be default on for new car sales as that's most similar to what customers would be used to from ICE cars."
Hit the brake!!
"Wait, Malcolm Gladwell is actually right about something?"

"This is like every accident involving an elderly driver. ""I don't know what happened, the car just lurched forward and ran into the building."" No grandma, you got confused and hit the wrong pedal."
"Absolutely. I run an e-commerce store and offer free shipping and free returns.  Customers will call us every day and say “you shipped me the wrong stuff.” When in reality they simply chose the wrong color/size themselves. You’d think that having them look at their email confirmation showing what they ordered would prove to them we actually shipped what they ordered, but no, we somehow “changed the email” 😂"
"""I didn't change anything and it stopped working."" 

*Does git diff and shows 10 different files*

""Yeah but that shouldn't affect anything!"""
To be very clear you are recording sensors that purport to have recorded actual data.  It’s not the actual data.
Is this sub just people with stock in Tesla
They don’t need to look at drivers feet. They have the data from the sensors on the pedals.
"Is it possible that there isn't driver feedback when the accelerator is stuck on an electric vehicle whereas there is with an ICU.   When an accelerator is stuck in an ICE vehicle the driver will hear the engine growl even if the driver also has their foot on the brake.  On an electric, it sounds like there isn't feedback, until the driver takes their foot off the brake.  This would still be driver error, but I wonder if that could play into it."

Someone who profits if the stock goes down.
"No relation to shorts seller, who usually deals with clothing."
"I think a stock is going down. I borrow that stock from Joe Investor. I sell that stock at its current price (say $500). And have an agreement in writing that I will give Joe Investor his shares back within a certain amount of time and in return I pay him some fee.

Stock goes up (is now $1000) - I buy the stock back, and give it back to Joe Investor. I've now lost money. -$500 per share.

Stock goes down (is now $100) - I buy the stock back, and give it back to Joe Investor. I've now made money. +$400 per share.

But while I have that short in place, I have a monetary interest in seeing it goes as low as I can. I may go on news outlets and trash talk the stock, and tell everybody I can why it's a bad deal.

----------

For this specific instance, it's certainly in the short seller's interest for the company to tank, they could be motivated by trying to do the right thing (as well as the money).

I mean, if you knew some shady company was doing some shady shit, you might short their stock before you start trying to bring them down - that's not a terrible idea.

BUT - if you have bad intent, like say you're an oil exec with a vested interest in electric transportation being stopped or slowed as much as possible, you might not be acting in good faith.

I'd guess this is probably the 'not good faith' type of short."
"As others have correctly and expertly said, but they missed the bit, saying they have to be under 5ft 2in"
"It is an investor whose investments are such so that he stands to make profit if shares go down, and lose money if they go up."
Someone who is financially hurt if the stock price goes up.
I mean they easily could be and just aren’t publishing it
They can but courts take forever and a lot of data could be released in order for Tesla to prove they’re telling the truth and do they really want to invest so much money and time to go after a no body? The best thing to do is release a statement and move on. But who knows? Maybe Elon has had enough and he does file a lawsuit against him.
iirc you have to prove intent.  Shorty can just say he is a concerned citizen and wanted to bring a potential fault to the authorities attention.  Case dismissed.
"I think that is the case too. If it were real, there would be YouTube videos demonstrating it."
Chill is for less accel.  Object aware acceleration is for pedal dyslexics
"When I first got my home charger installed, I too was a dumbass and went to pull forward out of my parking space, but put it in reverse out of habit. (I had just started backing in to charge, before then I backed out.) I pressed the accelerator, and the car did actually slow me down due to obstacle-aware acceleration; I remember thinking it felt very ""heavy"" before I realized what I was doing. It would've let me keep going and back right into my fence, but the artificial slowness bought me the extra second or two to realize I was a moron and stop. It works!"
That is true.  You were being a dumbass.
Did you have Obstacle Aware Acceleration turned on?
"I don't know if it's so much the media behind it, as it is people using the media as their tool. We're at the point where people can and do put together what looks like a shiny, legitimate ""news story"" on some domain that sounds believable, and some media outlets will merrily snap that up and broadcast it as if it was the gospel truth."
"The media today gets money from clicks.  Clicks come from juicy stories.  The words ""Tesla"" in any media guarantee clicks.  Negative coverage guarantees more, and honestly ""news"" is about the bad things that happen in the world.  Not the good things."
Not likely. The phantom braking seems to be generally accepted as an issue with using radar.
"I sometimes experience issues with phantom braking. I suspect faulty map data with wrong maximum speeds, because I saw the target speed drop from 120km/h to 50km/h and few seconds later going back up to 120km/h. It scared the hell out of me, and I was lucky I had no one behind me. This was on a clear and straight section of highway during the day with good visibility."
I don’t think everyone is accurate. Especially on here.
"I owned a Toyota Prius.  It was one of the first accused of unintended acceleration.  I got new floor mats with hooks in them (to prevent bunching, one of the hypothetical causes).  Toyota spent lots of money investigating.  In the end, there was no actual evidence of a failure.  It took years and millions.

Tesla has a great deal more information, partly because this ""unintended acceleration"" claim has been applied to many other cars since.  They have metrics, actual data of which pedal is pressed, and when, and how much -- not all cars do, but Teslas do because they are designed to capture these metrics.  So when Tesla categorically denies that the reported events were caused by an error, it is not just denial, it's that they have looked at the data and concluded that something else happened ... most likely user error. And, they share this exculpatory data with NHTSA. That's what the report says, at least.

Perhaps Tesla is covering up something like VW did when they faked their emissions test results.  I seriously doubt that.  Otherwise, what you're hearing is an engineer saying ""We have looked at each event using data we have and found no cases of unexpected behavior."" Sure, maybe the software that records the metrics is in error ... but that seems unlikely.  So not naive, rather just factual."
If you read it...hitting the brake overrides the signal for acceleration.  So it is essentially the same as the clutch if not even better since the motor won’t keep revving.   It also would override any floor mats issue.  The brakes wouldn’t actually fight the power since the signal for power wouldn’t even happen in a Tesla.  Also there is no throttle cable on Tesla’s to get stuck.
"Items 2 and 3 in your example are not defects of the car (or the fault of the manufacturer). If people are going to say Tesla (or Toyota, or Audi, or etc) is at fault for unintended acceleration when some bozo puts a floor mat in the way of the pedal, then by that logic it's also Tesla/Toyota/Audi's fault if someone puts a brick on their pedal."
If there’s a car right in front of you and you slam on the accelerator it will assume that’s a misapplication.
"In a drive by wire car this is easy. I know my old ICE car limited the max revs while pressing both pedals but in some cases pressing both is needed. For example when towing a heavy load up hill you can start to depress the clutch but when you release the brake you'll still roll backwards due to the heavy weight and the clutch not fully engaged. Using the accelerator you can let the clutch slip until you feel the car going forward. Then you release the brake. Obviously a handbrake can do this but many cars have an electronic handbrake which is shit. It's a delicate balance between brake, accelerator and clutch which requires you to heel/toe the brake and accelerator but when done right it is a very useful technique."
"I'm surprised again, after testing I'm pretty sure my previous guess as to what happened is wrong. Turns out the car can't enable CC when stopped or at a low rate of speed. I suspected this would be true for a parking lot, but I tried it on a road and right stalk down from stop or low speed won't enable either CC or AP."
"So you're proposing a change to the user interface of cars?  Very bold, indeed!"
With the model 3s it is turning into 1 pedal driving. Car acts more like a seadoo
"The other thing to keep in mind is that even if 100% of these cases are the result of the driver pressing the pedal, if the rate of unintentional acceleration is significantly higher than other vehicles (note, that is a very big if) that may still indicate a design flaw with the car.  If you make a product that is very easy to use incorrectly and that incorrect usage can result in damages and injury, it is a flawed product."
"Curious - were you at a stop when this happened?

How much more seriously can Tesla take it than looking at the logs of every incident and examining/confirming the hardware and software systems in place to explicitly prevent this? Seems like they’re taking it plenty seriously."
"I am in chat right now with Tesla with dates, times, locations, everything and they told me to go buy a $1200 Event data recorder because they can't pull that data without the courts being involved.

So all the cars that were checked, were apparently court ordered. I am basically throwing my cars data at them and they don't want it. I'll admit, I am surprised they can't pull everything OTA. I'm just going to keep my eyes peeled for a while to see if it occurs again."
"Your post is unclear.

In any vehicle, your right foot should always be the one used to switch between gas or brake. Your left foot should never ever touch anything, unless you are driving a manual vehicle, where it should only ever touch the clutch.

Any other way is a dangerous and incorrect habit.

No idea what you mean by accidentally stomping on the accelerator."
Please don’t drive behind me!
"There's a Tesla hacker that pulls logs for insurance companies who has a standing offer of $10000 he will pay you if your car is the first ever to have actual SUA.  You owe him $10k when he proves it was your foot.

No charge for pulling the logs and he will be your expert testimony for free too.  If you're confident to put your money where your mouth is, contact him."
"> I'm going to ask them if they can pull data from my car

You have a case where the car accelerated outside of you pressing the accelerator pedal? Did you hit something?"
You should.  If you have an issue. Submit it for a claim.
"Every Strawman:. ""if I only had a brain"""
"More like Tesla: We have individually checked every bug report for *this specific problem* and found that every single one was a user error.

Also, I am a software developer and have never met a fellow developer who says their systems doesn't have bugs."
"This isnt software you dud, this is event recording from multiple sensors that prove without a doubt its the users faults for hitting the pedal.

Jesus people are dense"

Indeed. I’d say that’s that.

"> Most other companies spin it somehow or use vague language to cloud the issue.

If I dont have anything to hide, i dont have anything to spin, or use vague language. In other cases other companies used blunt words do defend themself vs. (sometimes outragious) allegations because they knew its Bullshit. As soon as you get walk arounds and the sorts, you know there is either some truth to it, or it relates to something they are in fact hiding/is illegal/could get them in trouble.

In this case, tesla has the cold hard facts on the table from multiple systems, reviewed and signed of by the NHTSA. Having responded anything else would be wrong and/or stupid."

"Without going into details, ex auto mechanic here, and I currently work in the industry, sometimes investigating similar claims.   Pretty much  always driver error on the ones I've seen."
"there was an Advert from Nissan 6+ years ago. and it went something along the lines of:  
""All 20XX Nissans use electronic throttles that when the brake and accelerator is depressed at the same time, the engine rpm is reduced to idle levels.... ""*in Fact this has been on all Nissans for over 10 years.""*  


it was some HUGE shade thrown at Toyota.  pretty much starting mid 97 all Nissans were drive by wire and had this baked in."
All cars with e-pedals are like this. Standard in the industry.
"Even more interesting, the early versions of these pedals had two identical sensor curves in opposition, so there was a slender theoretical chance of there still being wrong signals that threw things off. Nowadays they also have two different curves, so there are even fewer ways that things could go wrong."
"Pretty much every time this happens it's when a driver is in an unfamiliar car, they go to press the brakes, accidentally press the accelerator, panic and slam down on the accelerator (thinking it's the brake), and then if they are still alive try to sue."

">Chill is for less accel.

This is what they need. The people that have mistaken a brake and accelerator pedal in a ICE car have time to correct themselves. In a Tesla with near instant max torque, they do not and end up driving into the garage wall or a convenient store."

"Make that billions. Toyota recalled 10 million cars and were fined 1 billion dollars. Plus civil lawsuits that followed... All because of unsubstantiated claims and hysteria about unintended acceleration.

"Yeah, I've read it. The point of this comment was mostly ""there's almost no freakin way the car would be at fault"".

I have to slightly disagree with the brake overriding accelerator to be better than clutch - at least from the safety point of view. If something in ECU will go haywire, and signal full throttle (or full power to the motor in case of EV), it might as well ignore the brake signal telling it to kill the power. The clutch is completely independent (mechanical) system any electronic system in car cannot mess with. So, from the safety point of view, clutch is better."
I agree (and actually wanted to say this). Edited to make this clear.
I don't have any specific user interface change in mind.  I just know that what we have today is incredibly dangerous.
"Yep. Unintended acceleration due to petal misapplication is still considered unintended acceleration. 

I wont be surprised if fast, cheap EVs force the US to adopt a tiered licence system."
"I remember three incidents where it accelerated from stop and once while I was driving. In 2 of the cases, my leg wasn't even close to the accelerator. 

I initially thought that something was wrong with my car and I went and spoke to the Tesla service center guys. They said that it is not possible and if something goes wrong with autopilot, the car would warn the user to take it to the service center. I tried to tell them that this happened when autopilot was not enabled but they insisted that it is not possible.


Even if I have the videos of the car acclerating on its own, there is no way I can prove that I did not press the accelerator in that instant."
"They are referring to active braking, let off the accelerator and the car brakes. Nothing to do with the left foot."
"You know how in ice cars, when you let go of your gas pedal, your default position is to rest your foot on the brake? If you want to make a sudden stop, you stomp on the pedal your foot is defaulted to.

Now with teslas, your default foot position is rested on the gas pedal because of regen breaking. If you don't,  your tesla would brake by itself. So when you have to make a sudden stop, coming from an ice, you instinctively stomp on whatever pedal your foot is rested on.

It's completely an user error due to the switch from ice."
Please take up this hackers bet😂
"Why would I get a hacker to figure out what I am going to ask tesla to do? No one is going to go directly to the manufacturer with good intentions and then try to sue them. Well, some people may but I feel a split second of random acceleration isn't going to win any lawyers."

I'm a software developer, the responses in this thread make me laugh. If tesla or any other company for that matter showed you their bug repository you would cry. Usually most of it just gets ignored or and the majority of the time the software works as expected and the impact is low. 

this is how it worked for the 787max until it started crashing.."
No. I have had my car accelerate for no reason before. Nothing to do with regen. It was scary.  I just don’t see the harm in investigating this.
>and it slows or stops when the driver applies the brake.

"Most companies aren’t trying to push a new technology that other larger well established companies would love to see fail.  I think it’s unfortunate that Tesla has to continually defend themselves from things.

Ford, Honda, Chevy, etc don’t even have to respond or “spin” it.  They just put out a recall, pay off dead widows, and move on with their day."
It’s because of Elon’s philosophy of first principles and physics. He wouldn’t even design the system from the start that allowed bad things to happen. Most ICE cars have never been thought of like that as there’s so much legacy behind them.
"The solution they described is actually just the logical solution. It's basically the same as the solution in industry - which includes car manufacturing. So it should be a simple thought for them to use the same approach to vehicle controls.

Whether they actually do this is a different story, but I'd be surprised if any vary considerably from it. There may be some variation - maybe by using different sensor type or different mounting positions and thus requiring some conversion formula - but it's the solution they all should come up with.

If any are using just a single sensor on any of the pedals, and it's entirely electric, then they are utterly insane. The sensors have a failure rate, and we'd see it as rampant by now."

"No, most other car companies don't have the level of data monitoring to say unequivocally it was operator error or a sticky pedal. 

There's a world of analysis of first-person eyewitness reports. People can honestly mis-remember what happened or what they did, particularly in stressful situations."
So every company is guilty except this one... And you are basing this off of what?

Reset sequences are hilarious. Here’s a list for just window recalibration - http://www.autoglassreplacementquote.com/door-glass/window-recalibration-reset-reprogramming-sequences/
Ever added a replacement key fob? On a Toyota you look like you should be admitted for mental evaluation. Open door close door. Repeat 5x. Key on key off. Repeat 5x. Press button on new fob.
Yea my Subaru you had to unbuckle and buckle the seatbelt in certain time to turn off the chime.
Post the screenshot bro.
"I would, that sounds hilarious"

And also a joke.
"You can take a screenshot of the main display by pressing and holding on the setting app, but the screenshots are only visible by Tesla support unfortunately."
"I am working on a BMW 135 right now that looks like the customer legit took a hallway rug from their house, cut it in half, and is using it as floor mats. You can barely see the gas pedal."
Funny how some people in this sub claim every other car company is guilty and it's not driver error...
We have had TSB's for this 'issue' for a long time. Because a lot of customers liked to rest their foot on the brake pedal. Which cuts the throttle.
"Yep, can confirm. Basically a very safe design."
"If memory serves correctly, this was a criticism of the Toyota accelerator design, the use of non redundant low cost Hall Effect sensors to detect accelerator position could in theory result in unintended acceleration. It was never proven to cause any accidents but it was an engineering weakness. 

Glad to see the industry has learned its lesson. Honestly the investigation of these kinds of issues helps consumers -- having external checks is important for keeping companies honest. It's just annoying that in this case the petition seemed to be brought forward with ill intent."
"The e-pedal is a sensor.  Since there’s no mechanical linkage to a throttle plate, the only function is to pass a signal."
"Just like having 2 sensors for the 737-Max. If one of them says the nose is too high, the nose is too high. It gets dealt with..."
The attempt looks pretty clumsy to me.
"You can get some benefit by having the brake on either the forward or rear wheels while applying power to the other two, but it's marginal at best. The ideal use may be when you need to heat up the brakes, so you can do this to put more energy through the brakes while keeping the same speed (like when behind a safety car, or when going around a long corner and you can't accelerate out if it yet).

There may also be some vehicle dynamic factors that make it a bit useful. It might be able to help keep rear traction in some cases (ie, to prevent lift-off oversteer), but that is really questionable and would usually involve a very small amount of throttle. It's most likely better to not put the car in that situation in the first place."
I wouldn't think so. Kinda cool that it means that people in the habit aren't put out by it though.
"You didn’t get the point here. There system in my car is reporting that everything is working as intended.

If the system thinks wiping the windshield on a sunny day is the correct thing to do, it’s not going to log any error, airgo the sensors are reporting everything is funcioning as expected. In other words, even if the sensor is faulty and reading the “weather” wrong, it is still telling the car to wipe the windshield. The car gets that message and does it without logging any error because both of them think its raining."
"You’d think that majority of these accidents would be prevented if that were the case. 
I’m not risking to test it on my Tesla, but I’ve seen a Brit on YouTube show that his Tesla ran into his fridge, granted he was using the smart summon forward and backwards. But then there was a guy who tried to see if the car would stop for boxes in front, but it decided to run through them anyway. 
I’d like to believe what it says, but from what we’ve seen it’s not quite the case. I’m not saying that people didn’t accidentally press on accelerator, but you’d think it would stop before running through the garage door and other things."

Also, it’s much easier to prove your claim by simply releasing a statement that says you worked with the government agency on a lot of these cases and determine that it wasn’t Tesla’s fault or anything of they sort.

Edit: This was the perfect move, releasing a statement. The stock is up, and most people seek to be on Tesla’s side. The statement was perfect and it gained confidence from investors."
Chill still accelerates faster than most cars.  Try OAA it's really slow are probably what you're thinking of.
Something just doesn’t go wrong and there are redundancies.   You also don’t know how the override is setup.  It could be mechanical
"He is referring to the right foot. When I’m driving my model 3 my foot defaults to the accelerator. Even when I’m slowing down, to a full stop, my foot is on the accelerator. I only move my foot to the brake if there is something that requires mechanical braking. 
When I’m in any other car, when I need to slow down my foot moves from the right pedal to the left pedal and if something requires more braking I just push my foot down."

"Throwaway account I have been using for months lol I posted in the other thread with more details, and everyone lit the torches, so I will just ask Tesla directly and see if they find anything."
"Yeah, people can be harsh. 

I wonder if it accelerated to avoid an incoming accident?"
"> this is how it worked for the 787max until it started crashing..

*737.  No 787 has ever crashed as far as I am aware."
I think agree they didn’t say anything about no bugs.  They said all the ones they investigated were not bugs.
"A few questions:

* If you're a software developer, why on earth would you claim in your previous message that the software developers at Tesla say their system has no bugs?
* I am absolutely certain that there are hair raisingly many uninvestigated bug reports in Teslas issue tracker. That seems to be a constant of most software houses. But bug triaging is a thing. I'd be shocked if they don't go through near fatal accidents where the vehicle is blamed. We're literally talking about a few dozen incidents in total. My employer, which has a smaller engineering force than Tesla, handles a small number of P1 incidents *per day*.
* I don't get the parallel to Boeing. As can be seen with the Crew Dragon vs. Starliner, the SpaceX and Boeing couldn't operate more differently if they tried. The same is no doubt true of Tesla and Boeing. So what point are you trying to make?"
"It was you.  I am not saying you are lying I am saying you are mistaken.  Submit your incident and they will.  As they have EVERY OTHER INCIDENT.

Why do people keep saying they don’t see the harm in investigating when Tesla and everyone on here keep saying they ARE INVESTIGATING!   They always do investigate.   Every time they get one fo these claims they investigate and every time it is user error.

I feel like people just don’t understand English..."
"Tesla has investigated this and so has NHTSA.

If you had a problem, you need to submit a bug report and that would automatically save the logs. And then Tesla can look into your particular case.

I bet you triggered traffic aware cruise control if you were not pressing the accelerator pedal."
"Nice try but impossible. Maybe you turned on cruise instead of turn signal.  That happens, but whatever it was it was you.  There isn't even a fuel injector to get stuck so it's physically impossible and logged at like 400 hertz"
"Y..yes.  I'm not sure how this has anything to do with unintentional acceleration...

This statement also doesn't conflict the other two statements I quoted."
[Here's the video](https://youtu.be/94d8CAB3zkM) of the feature in action...
"I've experienced this a couple times when I am in a huff and want to get around a slow/idiot driver.

"I for one didn't know there were two independent position sensors for the pedal. That might even be a required thing with drive by wire systems, but it was news to me!

Gotta love it.
"How about if there's an error, so it cuts power, but you NEED to keep accelerating like on a busy motorway going fast?

That also sounds dangerous."
I once listened to a podcast about those incidents and how they were almost certainly universally driver error. I think they even did some tests to prove that even if the car mistook the accelerator as 100% depressed if the driver was really on the brake pedal as hard as they claim the brakes win the battle.
"What was said:

>a criticism of the Toyota accelerator design, the use of non redundant  low cost Hall Effect sensors to detect accelerator position

What I heard:

*To pimp your ride on a budget, Toyotas go faster if you put magnets in your shoes!*"
What are Tesla and others using for sensors? Hall effect sensors seem like a bad idea from the jump due to the potential (albeit highly unlikely) for electrical interference to cause a false reading.
Clearly they can.
You can if you're the SEC.  They have a job and it isn't upholding the law.

There is no “unintended acceleration” in Tesla vehicles
The Tesla Team January 20, 2020

>This petition is **completely false** and was brought by a Tesla short-seller. We investigate every single incident where the driver alleges to us that their vehicle accelerated contrary to their input, and in every case where we had the vehicle's data, we confirmed that the car operated as designed. In other words, the car accelerates if, and only if, the driver told it to do so, and it slows or stops when the driver applies the brake."
Wow.  The /r/Tesla automatically deletes your comment if you mention the president by name.   Wow.
"You ""borrow"" shares from someone and immediately sell them. Then, if the price of the stock drops you can buy back your borrowed shares for less money than you originally sold them for and close out the short position."
"Fundamentally, you’re borrowing stock which you then sell. Later on, you buy the same amount of stock and give it back to whoever you borrowed from. If the price is lower than when you borrowed it, you make money.

The same basic principle of “buy low, sell high” applies. It’s just that you’re selling first and buying later, instead of the other way around."
Short squeeze!
"Yea but the point of your post is to explain in simple terms what a short sale is to someone who doesn't understand it. It's highly confusing when you start your explanation by saying you purchase the stock at the current price (plus fees) and then sell it at the current price. That suggests that you start out in the hole, which makes the rest of the explanation not make sense, because whether you buy it later at a lower or higher price, you are purchasing stock again after already losing money on the initial purchase and sale.

I understand that's not what you meant, but I mean read it... that's exactly what you're saying."
I’m actually from Greece and bonds are bets too :D
"> So yeah, an investment. All investments are bets except bonds.

If you want to follow that line of reasoning, then you fail already since clearly a bond ownership is a bet that the bond seller won't default.

But no, that's not a bet - that's you assuming the risk of that investment in exchange for a return. Which in fact the bond is almost always backed by collateral which represent the real value of the bond.

A short seller on the other hand does not own anything, it is purely a bet the price will fall. In fact in the middle term the short seller gets dollars in exchange for doing the short sale. It is pure speculation."
Yip
"I'm truly honored you think I have 10k to risk.

I'm not trying to make money, I'm trying to help improve the cars abilities. I don't know why we keep talking about putting money on the table."
"I also wonder that, I don't believe anyone was that close to me, but that doesn't mean the car didn't think there was. That was in my top reasons of why it *could* have happened. 

If this was the case, minus false collision detected it worked right. No one was in front of me (so it would know I was clear to accelerate). 

I did contact Tesla, in short they can't pull data on this issue without the courts being involved. (Which seems absurd)."
"And that's all well and good. I'm not making a determination if they do or they don't. I think as someone who would probably be working on something like this in my career it is important not to put blinders on and get emotional about reports of potential bugs.

It's easy to say short sellers are trying to put me down when it could be in fact a bug.

Lets try to be objective here.

\-Tesla claims the petition is COMPLETELY false and brought by short sellers.

\-Tesla then claims they in fact DO INVESTIGATE reports of unintended acceleration.

So which one is it? is it completely false as they claim or have users actually reported that the car accelerated when they weren't expecting it? If I put my foot on the gas gently and it lurches forward, it's probably not the reaction I was expecting but the logs will in fact show that I did press on the gas. Bugs are complicated so lets NHTSA do their investigation and sort it out."
"1. it was a joke. All software have bugs (that was the joke)
2. agree. i'm sure it is user error and nothing will come of it
3. more targeted at the ""short sellers"" quip because it made it seem like they are dismissing the reports because of who reported it. There are infact people who don't really care about short sellers (and their non effect on tesla stock performance)."
Probably didn’t even read the statement.
"> Why do people keep saying they don’t see the harm in investigating when Tesla and everyone on here keep saying they ARE INVESTIGATING!

I do believe Tesla in this matter, but saying Tesla didn't make a mistake because Tesla said so is naive.

The statement says ""we are transparent with NHTSA,"" but it doesn't say any other body has ""always"" investigated every claim."
"Honest, my hands were on the wheel.   But you’re right. I should have reported it right away.  But to me it was a one time thing so I didn’t worry about it.  If I had known that others might have seen something similar, I would have reported it. That’s what I’m hoping people will do after seeing this.  It isn’t about manipulating stocks, it’s about reporting something that they normally would dismiss. That’s all. 

I love my car. I just want it to be the best it can be."
"Tesla in the same paragraph states that the car only does what the driver instructs, and then a sentence later says it can over ride driver input if it deems the input to be in error.  

I’m sorry you can’t parse the whole thing."

I trigger that almost every day when the work gate is opening. It is just a [rising bar gate](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/7/77/Lift_gate.jpg) so I know when I can clear it but the car still cuts power. It is fine though so I leave the feature on.

I totally agree. Watching adults attempt to play unfamiliar video games has a lot of similarities. Even if the person is pressing the wrong controls they often do it again and again before resetting their minds and taking a look at the big pictures. Confused humans tend to just double down on their behavior rather than trying something different.
"I may have listened to the same podcast it was by Malcolm Gladwell, and it was very convincing they even carried out a real word world test.

Basically every car on the road has a braking system able to overcome the acceleration of the car."
"Yes, it sounds like you're referring to this Malcolm Gladwell podcast episode:

 [http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/08-blame-game](http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/08-blame-game)"
"There is a podcast by Radiolab titled ""bitflip"" that discusses some actual incidents of unintended acceleration that were shown to be a result of cosmic rays flipping a one to a zero (basically) in the cars computer which caused fatalities. Sounds like bs but after listening to this podcast and doing some further research it seems legit. https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/radiolab/bit-flip-c1mB07ZWCXz/

"Industry standard is (or was a decade or so ago) to put two potentiometers. One lead goes to +VCC (let's say +12V), second one to ground, and the middle/sensing lead goes to ECU. The second one has +VCC and GND wires swapped. So in idle position, one sensing wire is at +VCC and second one at GND. At full throttle, first is at GND and second at +VCC. And if these signals disagree, ECU detects a fault. You can play with this a bit more for additional safety - detect any kind of signal curve, that is unlikely to come from the human pressing pedal and ignore it, etc..."
Someone said that Teslas accelerators have two sensors output differing values at the same position; the computer will reject it if values don't agree or if the output of either (or both) is shorted (or grounded); it will also reject it if it doesn't see a plausible ramp-up; such as the output spiking up or down faster then any human can realistically achieve.

">-Tesla claims the petition is COMPLETELY false and brought by short sellers.

The complainant comes to an un-proven conclusion based on anecdotes. The facts Tesla has gathered from logs, along with independent tests and system designs shows facts are greater than anecdotes, and thus the CONCLUSION of the claims is false and provably so.

> -Tesla then claims they in fact DO INVESTIGATE reports of unintended acceleration.

Tesla has investigated certain reports of unintended acceleration to confirm their system is working as designed. If a dumbass wants to slam on the gas and ram into a store front (which happens in every car make and model across the entire industry), then that is a fault of theirs, not the vehicle's fault.

I would imagine they pull the logs not for every crash, but ones that have reached the NHTSA or through legal action. 

The NHTSA would have a hell of a backlog if they were to investigate every claim of unintended acceleration from every manufacturer just because they were distracted and dumb and refuse to admit they made a mistake."
"OK, thanks for clarifying. :)"
The person who file the complain don't even own a Tesla how can you investigate it if the complainant don't even own the f*cking car.
I think that insinuates all the claims that come in NHSTA asks for info on and Tesla gives it to them.  Not just this BS one that was raised by Sparks.
"Wrong, the first paragraph states that the car will only ACCELERATE when the driver instructs.  Tesla, as well as almost any new car you can buy today, has automatic emergency braking.

The next portion is about stopping acceleration when the algorithm deems that it was possibly erroneous input via the rightmost pedal."

Potentially. At least with acceleration, I can brake if need be."
"Sensor failure does not mean sensor goes offline. It means it returns the wrong value.

"sensors can fail on.  if the sensor fails and sticks to 75%, the car would continue accelerating.

Critical systems are always doubled up for redundancy and cross checking.  Factory machine safety is the same way."

"It sounds less insane if you know that this is actually a pretty common thing in computing; cosmic rays hit your RAM *all the time*, and because of the nature of volatile storage, it's trivial for them to affect your computer's behavior. IBM did studies in the 90s, showing that the average computer has one cosmic ray related error per week per GB of RAM. That's just errors, not the rays that don't cause any harm. If your computer ever randomly crashes and there's literally no explanation for it, it could just be an unlucky cosmic ray."

So if you call them and say you had SUA today  even though you didn't they'd report that to nhtsa with logs showing you made it up."
"Not OP, but If “widows” was intended and “windows” was a joke then paying off dead widows is likely a reference to settling lawsuits instead of fixing the problem.

The movie fight club has an entertaining if somewhat NSFL explanation of the equation here: https://youtu.be/SiB8GVMNJkE"
"Oh, I never read the claim, only Tesla's response on this thread. So they should have said widower, or they meant it more generally than what happened in this case."
"Maybe they remarried, or have kids. They’re paying off the dead widow’s estate.

Clearly the accident rate among widows must be shocking."
"Also a very important piece of info, if I have one sensor I can't tell if is a bad signal (static value despite changing petal position) compared to if I use two sensors. Then if the sensors disagree I at least know one is broken/malfunctioning."
So the “bank” would be the original person holding the stock?
You too!
If Ford and GM wants to force their competitor into a costly recall they will find a patsy that actually own's the defective product and convince him to file the complaint.
Exactly.  Which is why everyone on the reddit saying they had it happen should report it.
"Oh yeah, dead widows did make sense initially. Damn reddit sarcasm"
He should have left out the word “dead.”
Survivor's Guilt gets them in the end and they develop driving deathwishes.
"There are also some extra things they could be doing with position sensors.  e.g. the 'zero input' position might be beyond the pedal resting position so a sensor short or bias would be identifiable as different than a nominal pedal position.  Generally, these are well known, high reliability parts with understood failure modes."
Boeing should take notes.
"Right, generally with your broker helping out. For a retail investor, you just put in an order to sell the stock short with your broker. They will find a lender (possibly another customer of the brokerage, possibly a bank or large institution who holds the stock as part of their investments), borrow the shares, and sell them. When you put in an order to cover the short, they’ll buy the stock on the market and return it to the lender."
"All of the 127 reports Sparks googled had already been reported, any others will be too."
"Me:

Reading comprehension: 0%

Wooosh: 100%"
Hmm. Interesting. That movie about the short sellers during the housing market crash makes a little more sense now
I think its time to stop comparing Tesla sales to just EV sales. I'm more interested in overall car sales. The point of Tesla isnt to sell the best EV but the best CAR.

"The problem now is that I need to wait 8-11 weeks for mine. I waited just a couple days too long to hit the order button, it was right after the estimate jumped up."
It's almost like spending all your money on building a great product (rather than advertising and lobbying congress to make life hard for your competitors) is a good business model.
Is comparing Tesla sales to other EV sales even a fair contest? It’ll be news when they outsell gas cars.
"Rather than Tesla's marketshare declining in the future, it may only go up.   No other company comes close.  Others automakers are doing better in Europe and China, but I think Tesla's marketshare will go up in both once the Gigafactories are producing at full speed.

But Musk has said they can't do it alone.  Well, I think Tesla can, but it will just take longer."
"Guys this isn't a good thing, if no other car companies are making compelling EVs we're just fast tracking climate change even more."
I want one but just too expensive. I live in a snowy climate so AWD is a must. 58k is about 800$/mo for 72mo.
"I just got my Model 3 back from the shop. They gave me a loaner Model S 75d. I'm sorry, but the Model 3 is much nicer to drive! The Model S is big and roomy but it drives like a boat. I really enjoy driving my car, and autopilot is a fucking godsend in Bay Area traffic!"
Domination
Wish I could afford one
I can’t believe some car reviewers are rating the Chevy bolt better than the model three.  Edmunds is crap.
Tesla should put the $35k model 3 back on the web menu instead of keeping it an off menu special order
And all of these other companies are actually allowed to sell cars in every state. Tesla has to fight with the automotive dealers Associations
"26,900 of them are in Los Angeles"
"California is what’s to come for many places. There isn’t going to be dozens of different cars anymore. I work with maybe 25 folks. 5 of us drive a Model 3. That’s in less than 2 years. Think about it.

I just don’t see how VW and GM releasing dozen of electric cars is going to do anything but drive costs up"
"To be honest, the Chevy Bolt looks pretty damn decent. But it's just too expensive."
"Please also compare it to Europa Number. Because here, VW push hard EVs ($20K for 140 miles), Toyota is the company that have the lowest co2 per car (after Tesla of course), Peugeot is offering a $35K EV with a 190 miles range and the SR+ is more than $54K."
The BAM fanboys need to gtfoh no one wants to go to a dealership for any ice vehicle anymore this is the 21st century
"It's good statistics. But tbh I would compare it also with the most selling **ICE** cars, because they are the main and the most important competition now."
" I'm so glad the auto dealers turned Tesla down and Tesla decided to sell direct to consumer.

Absolutely dislike dealing with dealers. I'd rather just have Tesla way of buying cars for all cars."
Without Tesla there would be a slow death eventually for ice cars due to ev imports from Korea and China.
How much of this has to do with the expiration of tax benefits

"I think its more important that we sell EV's of every brand more than ICE cars, rather than compete among each other.

I am glad to see Tesla force the rest of the industry into modern technologies such as over the air updates, electric, and autonomous systems. 

If the big 3 could have their way, they'd keep cars complicated and as dumb as possible."
I AM the ev market!
All in on $TSLA calls

"If anyone wants to stick it to those ICE vehicles, you can buy me a Model S, 3, X, Y, Cybertruck or Roadster I'll wait!"
How do we know this number is real? Who is this Kevin douche?
What a stupid statistic.
[removed]
"27,000 that might randomly accelerate."
"The Tesla Model 3 had 158,925 sales in the US in 2019, just missing being ranked in the [top 25 models as the Ford Fusion sold 166,045 units.](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/g27041933/best-selling-cars-2019/?slide=1) 

[The Tesla Model 3 was the 3rd best selling vehicle in California through September](https://cleantechnica.com/2019/11/30/tesla-model-3-is-3-best-selling-vehicle-in-california-through-september/) and may have jumped into 2nd place after a strong 4th quarter."
Also time to stop comparing sales for the last month of a quarter to other companies for the same month. Everyone who watches Tesla knows they sell most of their cars each quarter in the last month while most other car companies level load their sales from month to month. So you really have to compare quarter to quarter or year to year.
"27,000 would put the Model 3 above the Camry, Civic, and Corolla [for December sales.](https://focus2move.com/usa-best-selling-cars/) 

*(although the linked chart shows the Model 3 at 15,485 sales for December, their Corolla yearly number matches Kelly Blue Book but their Model 3 yearly number is well below Kelly, 159k v 180k, so that 15k number is likely not accurate)*"
"3,800 miles and two months in, my little SR+ is absolutely the finest car I have owned. Hands down. 

BMW 550?          
(Nope) 

BMW E46 ZHP?  
(Close, but nope) 

Jeep JK Wrangler cruising with the top down and doors off on a sunny day?  
(Yes, but it’s a fucking abomination on any day that doesn’t have sunny cruising, 24 inches of snow, or mild flooding, which is about 350 days a year in my climate.)"
"I hear what you are saying. I think it’s good to look at it like the original iPhone. They had 100% of the smartphone market, but only 2% of the overall market. However, this led to them dominating the smartphone marketplace in the long run. Tesla is currently at a similar position. Time will tell"
"Agree, however I had a different takeaway.  The article showed that sales among non-Tesla EVs is declining.  Also, [this chart](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dfd5aca7badfa129f80056c/5e221df2f6c56d206de4c2d1_teslamodels5.png) shows that non-Tesla carmakers are only selling about 3,000 units per model.  A car company can't make make much profit off of such a limited product run.

If no one except for Tesla can make a profit in the EV space, then we are still a long ways from mainstream adoption of EVs."
"Agreed, but I also think that over time all cars will be EVs... so we'll probably be back at square one :)"
Well said
Reliability or quality wise?
Until most buyers look to buy a EV that make no sense to compare model 3 to other ICE vehicles
"In the Netherlands, model 3 was best selling model of the whole year 2019 with 29,922 units sold. 
Of which 12,000 in December alone. 
(17.4M people living in the Netherlands)."
[deleted]
"The only car in its price range that can compare for driving experience is the Alfa Giulia, which in my opinion has the best drive of any sub $75k car I’ve ever been in. That being said, it has shit equipment and its interior is kind of cheap. Great drive, but nowhere near the luxury of a model 3."
100% this. Tesla somehow went and made a ~$50k car my dream car and favorite car ever.
My parents made fun of me for getting one last year. I let my mom drive it a few times and she got one in July. My dads been driving hers to work and he’s probably going to get a Model Y when it comes out. They’re just great cars and the gas savings is very significant.
"If its anything as good as my chevy volt, im excited. Def my next vehicle."
A model S? A model X?
"Or because there is almost no competition yet. Tesla is an EV company only, really the only other completely EV company I know of is Zero, and they make motorcycles. Of course if you want to buy an electric car right now there is really only the tesla, the Porsche may be a good replacement as it's obviously going to be built at a superior quality, and will have better handling. But Porsche is still more focused on their ICE currently, I dont think it's fair to blame them either, the Infrastructure for EV isnt their yet, once you can charge your car at any gas station, I might consider it. So why invest in something that doesnt even have infrastructure ready."
Book a taycan test drive. Your perception of awesome might change
"Well, hopefully you’ll get a slightly better car. Incremental improvements and all that."
Exact same here... I was busy playing around with configs and colors on the website then suddenly 8-10 week lead time to delivery to get mine. It’s gonna be a long wait but I’m hyped.
"It helps that they got to the point where they're appreciably better than the competition, and that cars have a vibrant community doing reviews."
"It’s almost a contrast to the smartphone industry when the iPhone came out. Apple didn’t need to advertise, they did, but I guarantee people were convinced more from hearing other people’s praise of the simple fact that it was hands down the best phone at the time. 

It’s going to be very difficult to catch up to Tesla. They are the worlds largest battery manufacturer, while also being the best cells on the market. If the battery technology exists, or is on the cusp of a breakthrough, you’d be stupid to think Tesla doesn’t know about and studying it themselves."
"You have a point, but I think you are a litel unfair toward the legacy manufacturer, imagen the director who tell the stockholders, my master plane is to louse money for 10 years before all the investment pay off...."
"I don’t know about that. BMW, Audi, and Mercedes make damn nice cars and while it’s taken awhile for them to take the EV market serious, they have the pedigree to catch up and pass. We as consumers only benefit from this. I think the biggest thing Tesla has done (aside from making EV’s real) is price the entry level Model 3 low enough to cause the German MFG to do some soul searching."
"It's an insane context shift that only maybe GM 'n Daimler have made any inroads to even _start_ approaching.

If you don't have a plan for battery capacity at volume scale, you are going **nowhere**.

Even if you design a perfect EV that everyone wants, you can't make them _at volume_ if you don't have access to power storage. The ""tank"" is basically a percentage point of build costs in an ICE vehicle, but it's like 25-50% of the build costs on an EV, and until they realize how vital that difference is, nobody's gonna make any inroads unless one of them somehow completely patent-captures a science breakthrough (Li-S, solid state, etc.) that also doesn't get caught up in manufacturing hurdles for a decade."
"> No other company comes close.

What they lack in technology, they make up with brand recognition and marketing. That's been the trend in Europe."
"Compelling alternatives to cars (ebikes, public transport, etc) would be enormously better for the environment than more compelling EVs, they're still pretty bad for the environment if not quite as bad as ICE. 

Though that would require people making an actual sacrifice instead of just buying new things."
"Nah, I have RWD in Alberta. AWD isn’t a must... the extra range would be useful if you don’t have a short commute."
Snow tires are your friend. Unless you're doing lots of mountain pass travel where AWD gets you out of using chains.
$58k? Awd is 48k for base.
800 a month is nearly the amount of some people's rent.
Being in Quebec in a mostly flat area the RWD is really good up to 20cm of snow
The model 3 is AWD though.
"Yeah, two of my friends has S's and it's like at tank compared to my 3."
"I'm thinking they will eventually when GF3 and GF4 are pumping out enough that they aren't 100% supply limited.

When you see SR+ on the website with less than 2 weeks expected delivery all the way through a quarter you can expect it's price to drop or the SR to come back."
"I wish they would also because I want to see their updated 0-60 times now that the free performance boost came out. My SR was supposed to be 5.6 seconds before that update, and now presumably it’s a little faster."
Not mad at that. I would like to breathe cleaner air 👌🏻👍🏻
"Unfortunately for VW and GM, pumping out dozens of EVs all at once may seem like a good strategy, but if the don't have the ""special sauce"" then they won't sell well and the huge investment may not pay off."
My circle of friends with Tesla's has gotten bigger and bigger (I'm the newest addition). They don't need any marketing.
Keep in mind no one buys a Bolt for the sticker price. Last I heard some places were offering $10k off just to liquidate the 2019 models.
"Long discussion here if you're interested

"Euro manufacturers are fully on the EV ship. It's the Japanese and Americans that won't commit.

Partly due to legislation and partly due to Europe generally having much smaller cars, roads, expensive fuel etc. which is driving uptake."
Also you have the Renault line with the Zoe and the Twizzy.
You are right. My wife is desperately in need of a new car but we are refusing to buy an ICE vehicle. We dont want 6 years of payments plus down payment on an old technology. We are gonna make due with what we got until we finally do the switch to electric. I am seeing the same sentiment with alot of my friends and family as well. For years I was planning on restoring an old Porsche but thats not gonna happen now. I finally put the money together for the car and restoration costs but I feel it will be a total waste of money. I wonder what types of cars teenage boys have on there bedroom walls these days.
I thought they always wanted the DTC model
"Not sure where you’re getting your info from, Tesla fought tooth and nail to get DTC. They didn’t want the auto dealer model to improve margins."
yah. you've got it the wrong way round. But some states still do not allow DTC. Gotta protect those shady car salesmen right?
I doubt it... none of them have the reach and impact of Tesla. And imports from China? Have there been any?
"Autist detected, yolo puts"
"Really? According to carsalesbase.com, US Mercedes C-class sales were 3412, US Audi A4 sales were 2152, and US BMW 3-series sales were 5245 during the same period."
"Want to provide us with more numbers? How many cars did ford sell in December in the us?

The real players are vw and Toyota, but still, Tesla is doing alright at selling cars for an American company"
are you having a stroke?
As might any car
Did you think of that one all by yourself?? 🤣😂
"I think something missing from these numbers is the cost.  Civic and Model 3 aren't exactly the same price. Yet M3 ranks somewhat close to them is astonishing. Lot of people have spent more to buy the M3. I honestly wonder if one day Tesla would tap on the market which is the Civic and Corolla, the less than $20k - $30k market."
and the Fusion is allowed to be sold in every state
"Except I heard they only registered like 5 in December!

Edit: Didn't think I needed the /s 😂"
I'm kind of disappointed that 166000 people bought Ford Fusions in 2019. That car hadn't had an update in 6 years and wasn't that great to begin with.
"Absolutely true to understand the overall impact and context. However, it is still interesting that the December burst is more than the annual sales of every other plug in vehicle.

It also means that Tesla’s delivery logistics have to handle that kind of burst. That’s not really a good thing and hopefully when they have production factories on 3 continents the extreme batching effect will reduce dramatically. That would help the customer experience. Certainly, the expiring incentives in various places also stretches logistics and causes poor customer experiences."
"This is rather meaningless data - to get the real story you need to look at the quarter or the year instead.

https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-q4-2019-vehicle-production-deliveries

Tesla delivered 192k vehicles (total of all models) in the US 2019. 159k of those were Model 3s. The sales of the S and the X are so low these days (down 26% and 42% respectively compared to 2018) that they wouldn't be commercially viable for any major automaker.

Meanwhile, Toyota sold 336k Camrys in the US. And 304k Corollas, while Honda sold 326k Civics and 268k Accords. 
  
https://www.caranddriver.com/news/g27041933/best-selling-cars-2019/"
Jesus man tell me about it. Model S here and my wife has a 2018 Wrangler Unlimited. When I have to drive that thing it literally feels like the car is trying to shake itself into pieces.
"I’m 30 and my model 3 is my 35th car. I’ve owned bmws, Audi’s, Mercedes, classic muscle cars, diesel trucks, jeeps and rock crawlers. This is by far my favorite and the first car that I haven’t wanted to sell 6 months I.  I love it! I could never buy another ICE car!"
Model 3 is the best car I've ever owned but I'm never giving up my JKU.
"Interesting, my wife has a 2019 JL (Unlimited Sport S) and it is a blast to drive.  I was shocked at how well it corners and how smooth the transmission is.  My SR+ if still my favorite, but the JL is also a lot of fun."
When did Apple ever have 100% of the smartphone market exactly? Certainly not on the timeline I come from.
Elon: *cracks knuckles* Time to ramp up.
"Why would all cars be EV? I don’t think so. As demand for gasoline drops, the price will drop increasing the demand again."
I sure hope they are. Oil has caused so many problems in our world.
Wait Alfa actually built a driveable car?
"I have a Volt and a Model 3. The Volt is a great car, but the 3 is in a league of its own. Autopilot and the UI are honestly more important than being an EV."
"I've spent a bit of time in all 3. The S and X are better cars overall. Spacious, fairly luxurious, subjectively better looking, and they got more range and a bigger battery. Price no object, I don't know if there would be many 3s sold. However, if you're just looking at ""how much fun is it to drive?"" The 3, all day every day. Even without the performance option."
"There are plenty who feel the 3 is better than the S or X, including me. It’s ok to feel that way, there’s also plenty who think the S and X are better too."
My perception of awesome can be hindered by price 😉
Lol. Did it for kicks and giggles. Would not trade my 3 for the Taycan STRAIGHT UP.
Until you try to and do a road trip - even 200 miles to your in-laws house.
"Yes, please. Tell me where."
"Damn downvoted for an opinion. You’re right it might change, it also might not. I think the Taycan looks awesome inside and out. Still love my 3 and if I had to drop that much I’d rather get an X. If I were a rich man I’d probably get a Taycan too! I thought the whole idea was for society to move towards EVs and not create a monopoly lol"
In an ironic twist we'd all be better off if the other manufacturers DID catch up to Tesla.
"Eh I want to believe but they've made me cynical. The EQC seems to be a sales flop right out of the gate. The etron isn't selling great either and it looks like a normal Audi not a weirdmobile. BMW had the i3 which some liked the weird quirks but they cancelled it.

Meanwhile Tesla is outselling their flagship gas cars in the US. I just don't see it happening.

Hyundai/Kia, GM, and VW seem to be the only ones pivoting with any sense of urgency. I hope Hyundai/Kia can get better battery supply chains going because they actually have some decent offerings if you don't need Supercharging."
I’ve heard that. The battery weight and low CoG is really helpful. Did you drive AWD before going to the Tesla?
Fair enough. That sort of furthers the point though. 48k is still 770/mo according to the Tesla calculator. People can swing that but the not the average guy/gal. I hope the next administration brings back some EV subsidies.
yeah the mortgage on my first house was 650 a month.
Not all models. Most are RWD.
"I'm not either, but it feels like every other car is a model 3 out here now. 😂"
Got an email yesterday that was for 2020 bolts. 5k off with 0% financing for 72 months or 5k plus another 5k along with tax credit .
"The twizzy is a joke
I wouldn't call it a competitor. The Zoé is a great EV but way more expensive than the 208 ( if you count the total battery lease cost)"
I said eventually. But China has a national ev intiative where as we have increasing gas production.
"Cadillac CT6 PHEV is made in China, but the sales are small. Polestar 2 will be imported from China.

Some Buick and Volvo models were imported from China but import tariff changes dropped that."
"Honda sold fewer than 23,000 Civics in December."
And all those manufacturers sell more than a dozen models. How many does Tesla sell ? 3. Of course their sales will be be more packed into the less vehicles while sales are more divided for other manufacturers. It is not hard math. Overall Tesla is a small brand in terms of total cars sold.
"Sorry, I  was referring to the sales in europe! And I do know that model 3 sales numbers are very high."
"Added a /s

Mocking the reports coming out yesterday saying that demand was plummeting in the US"
If nothing else other car companies need to see this as an opportunity. If you make it right you don't need price parity as people are willing to pay more if the product offers more. Smartphones didn't take over from flip phones because they were just as cheap.
"I thought I read once that a compact car was part of their future plans. This was right around when the M3 was unveiled.  The idea was to be cheaper and better fit EU needs, as compact hatchbacks sell really well. 

Since then, no mention of it. I’m guessing they will just focus on making the robo taxi service a reality, instead."
"I know it's a pain in the ass to buy a Tesla in some states, and there's some legal fuckery going on to make it happen, but are there any states where it's flat out impossible to buy one?"
But 5000 January 1st
It’s also scheduled to be discontinued which will be bad for the resale value.
[deleted]
A lot of people bought model Ss in the last three or fours years. I wonder (assuming they stick with the Tesla brand) which model they'll go with when it's time to upgrade.
"If S sales aren't commercially viable then why do Mercedes, BMW, Audi make luxury sedans that sell less than the S?"
Toyota and Honda don't seem to be losing their positions for sedan sales anytime soon. That is at least for their main sedan models. Those four cars are consistently the best sellers. I don't see Tesla making a dent in that anytime soon.
"Lies, damn lies, and statistics"
I think you should notify Porsche to stop selling Macans in US.
"You're an idiot. The Model S and Model X are selling extremely well. Sure, they are down from prior years, but they are doing extraordinarily well for the class they are in. See s-class sales:

https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/mercedes-benz-s-class-sales-figures/

 See 7-series sales:

https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/bmw-7-series-sales-figures/

Tesla outsells the best selling competition to the Model S. The Model X sold more than the entire lineup at Aston Martin.

The Model S and the Model X could support a decently sized company on their own."
I did love the JK. Or maybe it was Stockholm syndrome.
">	When I have to drive that thing it literally feels like the car is trying to shake itself into pieces.

That’s how everyone who drives a Jeep feels. It’s an offroad vehicle thinly veiled as a road going SUV. I do not understand why girls who never go off-roading are so fascinated with them."
Bottom of the barrel in reliability
Jesus that's a lot of cars. Why would you own so many cars? I'm almost 30 and the model 3 is my third car.
">I’m 30 and my model 3 is my 35th car. I’ve owned bmws, Audi’s, Mercedes, classic muscle cars, diesel trucks, jeeps and rock crawlers. This is by far my favorite and the first car that I haven’t wanted to sell 6 months I.  I love it! I could never buy another ICE car!

And that right there, everybody, is the definition of ""luxury"". 

it's a luxury to have a product you use everyday that makes you smile every time you use it, and makes other products in that same category seem dumb and antiquated by comparison."
"The JL is well ahead of the JK in that regard. It’s got the old Mercedes 5-speed instead of the ZF 8-speed, the suspension is better as well.  My biggest concern is the Jeep has poor braking and handling, especially on the freeway or in a breeze. It always felt like you had to be three steps ahead of the other cars. 

I was very close to buying a JL, but my commute has increased significantly, and I didn’t want a car like that on the freeway at the end of the day when you feel less than sharp. The $250/month in gas was the nail in the coffin. 

I am really going to miss it in the summer."
"I thinks it is a matter of semantics and I should have been more clear. Apple had 100% of the “modern smartphone” market when the first iPhone was released. Blackberries and palm pilots existed, but this was a huge paradigm shift in what a smartphone could be. At that point apple was the only company producing what we now consider a smart phone by virtue of inventing it."
"Yeah, I'm guessing it would take government regulation (similar to what is happening in some parts of Europe) to completely remove gasoline-based cars."
That isn’t how supply and demand works.
Specifically *burning* oil. We gotta stop that
I mean you *can* drive it. But for how long? Minutes? Weeks? Months? Years? No one really knows...
"I suspect that. My volt is at 100,000 miles, I want to make it live for as long as possible because of the breakneck speed of development in the tech EV's are enjoying right now. Would love that sodium-ion battery they are talking about"
"Yep. I have an SR and got to have a loaner P85D for over a week. My 3 has maaaybe half the horsepower, but is tons more responsive and tighter handling. The S is rocket-fast, but in comparison it’s also a little boat-like."
I would. Then I’d sell the taycan and buy a 3
"Some rich folk think this is a good selling point. 

Oops I can't visit my in-laws because my car can't make it."
"It's interesting to see how the arguments on range have changed to match whatever Tesla is selling at the time.  When the Model S came out, nobody could need more than 200 miles of range, and it was ridiculous to say that wasn't enough for people.  Now, apparently it's laughable to have only 200 miles of range.

Funny how that works."
"I agree with you. More diversity and competition in this system is to be welcomed and encouraged. Used to drive Porsche until I got my first Tesla. The build quality is not comparable, but I don’t care....I am more forgiving of Tesla than I have been of any car manufacturer. Very grateful to be part of what they are trying to do."
And I wonder if Elon Musk would even mind. Tesla and Musk will have changed the world as much as almost any other company or individual. Is that better than ridiculously vast amounts of money? (Because Musk will always have vast amounts of money).
Why ironic?
"> . The etron isn't selling great either 

The etron is selling pretty damn well in Europe, especially compared to the Model X"
"The etron is still too new to really gauge. I like the styling, it’s just a tad different than their Q7/5 design which is fine. 

I forgot to mention Jaguar partly because I would never consider them personally but they do make a nice EV.  Overall we the consumer only benefit from competition."
"Never as my primary work commuter but a Jeep and GMC Acadia as the family’s kid hauler. My commuter vehicle prior to the Tesla was a 16 year old Dodge Neon, FWD.

Traction on the SR+ is really good, even with all seasons. Stopping distance will eventually encourage me to get some winter tires."
"meh idk. ive had to put chains on my SR model 3 a couple times. it may do better than other rwd cars in the snow, but its still rwd. it does great with chains on but theyre such a pain in the ass. if you think you'll want awd, id hold out until you could afford it or get a used awd."
"I also have RWD Model 3 in Alberta. Previous car was full time AWD Subaru. With good winter tires, the Model 3 performs about 90% as good as my last car. That is saying something."
"Not the person you're responding to, but I had RWD before my Model 3 and my RWD Model 3 has been amazing in MI snows. I see no need for AWD in general, especially not with a 3."
"Agreed, but the average joe should also be buying used which still needs a year to develop any meaningful inventory. Another factor to consider is lower fuel and maintenance cost which can offset the higher monthly payment a bit."
"Well, 48k @3% over 7y is 634$ a month.  And I would bet most people are spending 150-200$ on gasoline.  So you’d probably save $130 on gasoline making it a $500 /m payment. 

The average person has spends less than a $500/m payment?"
Holy crap. I still want a TM3 more but that's tempting.
"> Of course their sales will be be more packed into the less vehicles while sales are more divided for other manufacturers.

Following this logic, US sales of Alfa Romeo Giulia should be through the roof as Alfa Romeo sells just two models here. Yet Giulia has been consistently selling at fewer 1000 units/month."
"Other car companies CAN’T match Tesla price and features.  The I-Pace, EQC and E-Tron are smaller, slower, have slower charging, less range and are $25k MORE EXPENSIVE than the upcoming Model Y.  And they might still be losing money, whereas Model Y will have near record gross margins."
"Flat out impossible no, but if you have to do it online, pay in advance, wait a month and have someone just drop it off randomly I can guarantee lots of people won't ever bother."
Michigan.  Detroit auto made it impossible to buy one in Michigan.  You can't even service a Tesla in Michigan.
I was thinking the same thing. There are half as many model 3s being sold as Camrys? That's incredible.
"data isn’t interesting until it is used as evidence for a specific hypothesis. most people leave off the actual claim they are making and hope the ambiguity can be used to their advantage later.

"My point is that the comment above me was touting that the Model 3 outsold various models in December - which is not a reflection of sales across the quarter or the year. 

The Tesla sales are impressive, but not as impressive when you aren't cherry picking the data set."
"Because they have a larger product range (more shared parts across models), more cost efficient production, and higher volumes (sold 2.3mm vehicles last year) - which is why Mercedes is more profitable at 7.5 % net profit margin.

The key problem is that Tesla has been reliant upon the proceeds of sales of their higher margin Model S and Model X financing the much lower margin (some analysts claim ""unprofitable"") Model 3. That has always been Tesla's stated strategy. 

Mercedes S Class is their most profitable line of vehicles (25%  profit margins) but it too is a struggling product - with sales in the US and Europe at around 50% their 2014 volumes."
[deleted]
US Camry sales have decreased 20% compared to 2015. They are holding rank in an ever shrinking pool of sedan sales.
"The macan is supposed to ev only in the next few years.

My wife has one.  I like it better than my Modelx sans the technology (which Porsche has greatly improved since hers was made.)

The X beats it zero to 60, but the Macan is way more fun to drive."
your point is right but there is no need to call someone an idiot
"The 7-series and S-class are a totally different class of car.  Larger, more expensive, far more luxurious, etc. Apples and oranges.  Same goes for Aston Martin.

Of course sales will look good when you cherry pick low-volume models that Tesla doesn't even compete against."
I have a model 3 performance and a 2012 wrangler jk sport with rubicon wheels. They're the two best cars ever made imo.
"They like the look, knowing nothing about cars and having never driven one. 

That said, I’m puzzled why they go through with the purchase *after* having driven one."
cuz i really like cars and am easily bored. i have a spreadsheet that i use to keep track of all the cars ive owned
Model 3 is my 10th and I’m 26. Guess I have some catching up to do!
This is a fun thread. I’m 36 and the M3 is my 6th car.
...that’s not at all what “luxury” means. Most especially in the context of cars.
"Yeah, fuel economy isn't great.  We actually ended up trying to have her borrow my SR+ once a week when she had longer drive days with the kids to help compensate for that.  Our monthly fuel budget line we noticed didn't change much we went from two gas cars (van and vw gti) to the SR+ and wrangler."
Exactly. Electric cars will still use oil for lubrication and plastic.
Yea people will keep getting better...hopefully.
"The current wave was launched less than 4 years ago and there haven’t been any significant problems yet. Mind you, 4 years for an Alfa is already a world record by their standards"
"I think even now people would appreciate more range than Tesla has, it is just that if range X is a available, why would you go for <x unless the price is substantially lower."
"It is laughable because of the value proposition, not the fact of the mileage itself. If they made a 200 mile , 40K car, many more people would go for it. But to ask 150K+ for less than 200 miles.... Well that just sucks."
"Lol. Lookie, the long standing Tesla hater trolling again. Your years long hatred of Tesla is boring everyone. 

Funny how that works."
"It's almost as if technology progresses, and expectations change.... Funny though that the only EVs beating older Teslas, are... newer Teslas..."
"My in-laws live 186 miles from my doorstep. I rounded up to 200, which is where that number came from.

Driving in sub-freezing temps with a head wind to go down to my in-laws for thanksgiving we left our house with 97% charge and arrived with 8%. And this was in a LR RWD Model 3 with aero covers, the most efficient Tesla produced."
Elon has flat out said if the industry can make EVs better than Tesla and Tesla goes out of business because of quality and quantity of competition he's fine with that. That would still accomplish Tesla's mission.
"https://insideevs.com/news/380011/e-tron-i-pace-model-x-norway/amp/

Best link I could find at first glance. Yes the etron is outselling the MX in Norway but it just came out. I'll be interested to see how the graphs look after the etron has been out for a year or two and the initial demand has been filled.

Admittedly my impression was probably US sales. I assume the Audi sells better in Europe due to brand loyalty and better generic charging network. US CCS charging network is really lacking and Electrify America is putting so few stations in I'm not sure it's really going to sway much opinion."
I’ll chime in here. I’ve owned mostly FWD cars and the occasional 4x4. I live in BC and drive up to the local mountains. I put Hakka R3’s on my mid range 3. The car does well overall with traction and stability control but falls short in two areas; hill climbs and deeper snow. I’ve been stuck on a couple hills that I feel like my FWD Mazda 3 would have gotten up. If you don’t have to deal with many hills I think RWD can work but I am left wishing I had AWD. Just my $0.02
You live in Alberta and use all seasons never the less on RWD?

"A year? Maybe 3 or 4... even the oldest used Model S's are still above 40k, and they have very few nice features in comparison to 2018+ cars.

I'm waiting for any used Tesla to get below $20k in good condition. Hoping my current car can last until 2030 or so, when that might happen :P

If Tesla didn't make cars people liked so much, I wouldn't be in this predicament!"
"My wife drives a Lexus GX (full time 4WD, V8, 7 seater, luxury SUV that requires premium) and has a 45 mile (round trip) daily commute across the city and she spends around $200 a month on gas, so I would assume your average person spends significantly less than that. 

My Lexus ES (Same size as an S) runs me about $60/month for my 20
mile commute as it uses regular instead of premium and it gets significantly better millage. So I would imagine the average person is closer to my usage than my wife’s. 

>	The average person has spends less than a $500/m payment?

I really hope so. I’m a married M.E. (D.I.N.K. At the moment) with no debt (besides house/car) and I’m spending $350/month for 60 Months on my used Lexus."
Lmao what is that kind of comment. I am not saying decreasing the number of models automatically increases total sales. What I'm saying is other brands sell more cars overall but divided in more different models. Tesla sells less cars but on even less models so the numbers for each model look very high on a model to model level. Mercedes sold 316k cars in the US alone. In december they sold 30294 cars in the US.
"I have to say that range and charging speed capacity were big drivers for my choice in a Model 3. I live in a condo, without access to at-home plug-in charging. Superchargers made all the difference to me. I probably would have ended up with an e-Golf if price and efficiency were top concerns for me, and Supercharging wasn't on the table."
"98% of people would PREFER that experience to walking into a dealership.  The only negative is the two week wait.  Although that’s growing, it’s a result of the popularity, not the method of delivery."
Who would do that lol. I don't even wait for shipping for my house appliances.
Why would the quantity have anything to do with the luxury status?
"Model 3 is in the premium/sports sedan class.  Yes it not only qualifies, it is by far the best pick in the class..  Exclusivity doesn’t matter in this class or at this price point."
"Given Tesla's huge self reinvestment to support advances and new model development, how can we say what the profit of the S really isvor would be? All those German companies wouls love to have Tesla's 4% or whatever profit if they could possibly also have their technology and potential."
lol. Mercedes earns money in their truck business. Where this sh%t about it being the most profitable car comes from?
"Auto manufacturers actually lose money when their cars breakdown during warranty, not earn it."
[deleted]
This is because their crossover sales have exploded. Will be interesting to see what the Model Y does!
"lol. Porsche sold 22k of these ""superior"" (and significantly cheaper) Porsche macans in usa.
Tesla sold 19k of Teslas X. By your logic Porsche should stop making macans (just like Jaguar should stop making  I-Pace and most of other their models etc. etc. etc.)
And I don't believe you have either Macan or Tesla X, not speaking about having two family ""SUV"" at ones."
"they're not materially more expensive. They're all $80k+ and are all tracked under the full-size luxury sedan category. They're not more luxurious because they have more buttons in the same way that a Rolex Datejust is not more luxurious than an AP Royal Oak just because the rolex has more details.

Whatever cars you want to compare to the Model S and X, go ahead. RS7, Land Rovery Discovery, BMW X7, Porsche Cayenne. Your pick. The Model S and X hold their own against any of them. Together they generate close to 3 billion dollars in revenue."
"My wife’s best friend replaced her 2012 with a 2017 (in 2017, mere months before the JL came out). For the same price, I bought my wife a used Lexus GX (which I wouldn’t have bought either, if we didn’t use it to go overlanding and tow our boat on the beach)."
All those performance cars and you went with an SR model 3? I don't mean to down talk your purchase. I am just wondering how anything short of the performance model could be workable to someone who has owned a slew of performance cars.
Lol. And I thought I had a problem.
This is the way
Hold out for the Cyberjeep.
Because range is only relevant to your own incredibly specific travel patterns.  There's a whole lot more than range that goes into a car purchase.
"¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

We'll see what the sales look like.  That's all that really matters."
"Yikes, struck a nerve there apparently."
"It's not about the change in expectations, that's normal.  What's funny is seeing all the same people that swore that 200 miles was more than enough for road trips now turning around and saying that 200 miles won't get you anywhere."
I don't disagree that 200 miles isn't enough range for a road trip car.  300 isn't even enough.  I'm just amused how the expectations have shifted so quickly.
"> etron has been out for a year

Look at how long the etron has been out. It has also sold better than the MX in its first year.

In the US it is selling very badly though, especially if compared to the X."
Fair point... being in Alberta I haven’t had to test any hills. Just endless boring flat prairie.
This is my worry. A visit to Duluth in the winter could end badly.
"FWD is nice given that you can direct the power (by being able to steer the drive wheels). But at least as far as RWD goes, I would imagine the model 3 would be among the best in snow given electric’s precise power control."
Yes. I’ve actually never once used winter tires on any vehicle. Just never tried or got into the habit.
It'd be a lie if I said it is better than subie. It's not. I do have Hakka 9 studded tires and changed the acceleration to chill so I haven't been stuck or couldn't go up a hill. Which is why I said it's 90% as good.
"A 2012 Model S base is maybe $25k on a good day right now. For $40k used you can probably get into a 2016 post face lift model S. Bear in mind the Model S started at 75k+ so its not really a good comparison to the 3 which is what we are talking about.  


2-4 year leases are where the bulk of used cars come from. Model 3 leasing started Q2 2019. The first leases will be coming off Q2 2021. I think we will see low $30k used 3's by end of 2021.  


I'd wager you can be in a $20k used 3 by end of 2022."
"In the same boat. For the time being, I’ve bought used Lexus for my wife and I. Stupid reliable, cheap to run (especially if you don’t mind doing maintenance yourself) , and very nice inside."
"I think you have to expand your horizon. Not everyone pays $2 a gallon for gasoline. 

I’m paying $1.10 / L in Canada, which is typical in Canada and I spent $150 /m driving 20km round trip to work and back, with an elantra. 

My Tesla now consumes $40 a month in electricity and our electricity is expensive at $0.15 per kWh... and we drive more now."
"You’re not saying decreasing the number of models increases unit sales per model, but you are saying increasing the number of models decreases unit sales per model? Got it, makes complete sense."
"So Mercedes entire lineup of vehicles combined sold roughly 3000 more units than the Tesla model 3, a single unit?"
"In the long run, yes. Right now, not so much."

I never mentioned anything about trucks...how is that relevant to the discussion? Daimler/Merc makes money off of both commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles... So what is your point exactly?
A HRV starts at the same price as a civic. A corolla is only $2k less than a c-hr
"Corolla sales are down 38% vs 2016. The market is clearly migrating toward CUV and SUV options. It's the same story across most automakers, even Porsche... I expect Tesla will sell boatloads of the Model Y. Hopefully it has enough margin in it to keep the company afloat."
">By your logic Porsche should stop making macans

What logic?  I didn't present anything remotely resembling an argument who should be making which car. 

Porsche isn't a mass market manufacturer.  They price themselves out of this market. 


>And I don't believe you have either Macan or Tesla X, not speaking about having two family ""SUV"" at ones.

Well, I don't give a crap what you believe."
"Why would Porsche drop the Macan? It is a cash cow for the highly profitable auto brand and is part of a suite of models that all enjoy excellent margins. And sales aren't tanking like the Tesla X and S, which have been cannibalized by the low margin Model 3. 

'The Stuttgart automaker enjoyed operating profits of $4.75 billion last year, helping it boost its workforce by 9 percent, to 32,325 employees. Net profit margin was a remarkable 16.6 percent—are you listening, Elon Musk?—with $28.5 billion in sales on a record 256,000 global vehicles. Punch your calculators, and Porsche is earning just over $18,500 in profit on every car it sells. '

"20% more expensive base price isn't materially more expensive?  Never mind the top end of the price range, where the S-class and co go past the $200k mark.  Even the 5-series and E-class are tracked under the full-size luxury sedan category, but you conveniently excluded those ones for some reason.

But you're right, they're not more luxurious because they have more buttons.  They're more luxurious because they have options for everything from massaging reclining rear seats to champagne coolers with matching flutes.

Anyways, if you want a comparison point, start with the E-class.  433,000 sold last year."
"He never said he got the performance models, but I’m also curious just from a financial standpoint why not get the performance if you can clearly afford it."
"Oh I wanted the performance for sure. It was just too much money at the time. Even with all my performance cars, the Tesla was still more expensive than any of the others.   I did preorder the tri motor cybertruck though. I know now just to go for it and get the top of the line."
"> 200 miles was more than enough for road trips now turning around and saying that 200 miles won't get you anywhere.

Because of... the change in expectations!

200 miles *was* enough, when that was the best the tech could offer - you could make it work with supercharging - that was the whole USP of Teslas.

The difference now is - you can do the same thing in a newer, cheaper, longer range, faster charging Tesla - so why wouldn't you?"
Well the only thing between you in the heavy killing machine and the road are tires.. and you never tried it in a place like Alberta? I’m sorry but that just doesn’t make sense I’m surprised it’s not a law there
An out of warranty Model S seems pretty scary tbh
">	I think you have to expand your horizon. Not everyone pays $2 a gallon for gasoline.

To be fair, there are almost as many people who live in my state as live in your entire country. 

Though our electricity is less expensive as well (I’m paying 8.8c/kWh)"
"No I am saying that Alfa never had great sales so them now only selling 2 models does not increase the overall sales numbers. But brands like Audi, VW, Mercedes and others do sell a lot of cars overall. And they do have many more models than Tesla so their numbers per model are smaller even though their overall sales are bigger. How is that so hard to understand. I feel like you are going out of your way to misinterpret the statement or to not understand it.

&#x200B;

edit:

We were also talking about Mercedes, BMW and Audi no idea why you suddenly talk about Alfa. Probably because you realized your overall statement was dumb.

&#x200B;

edit 2:

BMW sold 35746 vehicles in december 2019 in the US, Audi 25850 (14% yoy increase) and merccedes was already mentioned in another comment. Your initial comment was implying those manufacturers don't sell as many cars as Tesla does. When they in fact do."
Correct. Model 3 is best described as “upscale” or “premium.” Not luxury.
"i upvoted you. this hits close to home as i suggested tesla to my father when he was in the market for a car a year ago. he ended up going with a bmw because it had more of a “luxury”  feel. Not being much of a car guy myself, but more of an elon fan, id love to know what luxury car features are for my own education."
"Idk, compared to all other cars I've ever owned the model 3 seems to be luxury to me. Between the climate control, heated seats, performance, smoothness, quality of parts, attention to detail, etc. this car feels special in most ways."
"One of the dictionary definitions of ""luxury"" is ""an inessential, desirable item which is expensive or difficult to obtain"".  I think the Model 3 qualifies (today).  In 5 years? Maybe not?"
"I kind of agree with you. In terms of squeaking noises and build quality it’s far from a $65k BMW.

However: My car drives me pretty much all the way to work on it’s own. Accelerates faster than many rollercoasters and simply makes me happy every day. 

That’s luxury that to me."
"Most wrong things get downvoted.  You confuse buttons all over the place, with luxury.  You confuse rarity with luxury.  You succumbed to the fit/finish/interior argument put forth by trolls when there were no objective criteria left with which to criticize the Model 3.

You made the mistake of calling it luxury, when it’s designed as a premium sports sedan,  You ignored the premium aspect of a nice large fast screen, incredible sound system, smooth ride, effortless acceleration, non-cluttered interior, glass roof, open airy interior, incredibly comfortable seats.

All of that is not even talking about the best qualities that have nothing to do with luxury.  You “claim” to own one, but have apparently never even sat in one.

Yeah, no wonder you expected downvotes."
"I’ve owned several new BMWs before my Model 3 and it is just as luxurious if not more. The only difference is the feel in leather and interior. If you base luxury status on merely the interior then that is an opinion and not a fact. The Model 3’s price puts it into the luxury category as well. The feeling of a loss of luxury due to “rarity” is again a personal problem.

My family all have new Mercedes and the interiors are just awful."
"But isn't profit equal to revenue minus costs? And if you have high costs because you are spending a lot building up production and development infrastructure (eg battery megafactories), doesn't that lower profit?"
"The primary function of luxury goods is to tap top money clients segment
(be present in the ""executives"" world).
 There are companies (Mercedes is an excellent example) which can produce lux articles with the idea to earn money elsewhere with the help of such luxury products. For very long time personal car division of Daimler was in big minus. 
Mercedes doesn't generate 25% on MB S in EU because they don't sell it on MSRP (even 15% only on the most lucrative ""turbo"" variants which are not most sold). Most expensive variants generate actually less money because of significant tuning material and experts' time costs.
I don't believe their MSRP is that high in China either, though direct sells are a big thing in auto-business and they sell directly in China.

I think you generally don't understand what reported ""margins"" mean in auto business."
because the main part of the Daimler business is trucks. They make private autos with the main scope to boost and pad truck business. They changed strategy just some 20 years ago with no immediate success and moved into green in their private auto division just less than 10 years ago.
"Correct, the 7 and S were always slow sellers to the E class and S class.

BMW and Merc also have intermediate models like the 6 and CLS."
">	if you can clearly afford it.

Changing cars that frequently is typically not great for your finances. That may be why he couldn’t lol."
"I bought it at a bad time because I’m impatient. I had just changed jobs (I do that often) and we were just closing on our house in Seattle and had to dump a lot of money into it for a full remodel. Had I been patient and waited until all that was over I would have gotten the performance, but I didn’t know how much over budget we’d go with the remodel and didn’t want to overextend myself."

"My comment was a direct response to someone who said, I quote, “these numbers are great for an EV, but they are much lower than similar ICE cars”. The cars I listed are similar ICE cars from established brands available in the US. Giulia is another similar ICE car available in the US. The “implying” part is in your head. Nevertheless, I do find it fascinating that a compact electric premium sedan from a new brand with well-publicized service issues is selling in similar numbers to the entire lineup of a top tier luxury car manufacturer that includes sedans, wagons, coupes, and SUVs."
"I'm also curious. My vehicle is so barebones and a decade old, that even newer cars with standard features seem luxurious to me. Is dual climate control luxury? Sunroof?"
"Seriously. Being able to preheat/cool your car with an app, play games, watch netflix, and use autopilot on the freeway all seems super luxurious to me."

You get that in a brand new Golf.  I've driven a Golf and a Model S.  Besides the drivetrain the luxury level is about the same between the cars.  It is a fantastic drivetrain though and well worth the money.

"Material quality is not opinion. Real leather vs leatherette, real wood vs plastic colored wood, etc. Compare ""leather"" in a general motors car vs leather in a BMW.

Styling, which I assume you are talking about on mercs, is opinion. Material quality however is not opinion.

Personal bias frequently impacts the feeling of ""luxury"" but on average higher quality materials are one of the primary defining factors in ""luxury"".
Price is in no way any indication of luxury. Plenty of very expensive sports cars that are FAR from any sort of luxury."
"> The Model 3’s price puts it into the luxury category as well.

You can spend $85k on a Dodge Challenger, but that doesn’t make a Dodge Challenger luxury. Price ultimately has nothing to do with it."

"Modern society has started to equate technology with luxury, however luxury has traditionally dealt with fit, finish, and material quality.

For example, I have a Pontiac with ""Leather"". The leather however is only a small part of the seat and is actually ground leather mixed with other plastics and binders. A buddy however has a BMW (and not a high grade one) and his uses actual leather and it covers the entire seating area.

This also falls (traditionally) into things that are hard to manufacture. You can make wood like plastics and press out thousands of them, it is a LOT more difficult however to make a smooth shaped piece out of real wood."
True... show me a luxe car that can do this!

>	Being able to preheat/cool your car with an app, 

Chevy introduced that in 2010 and its standard on all their vehicles (though you need an on-star subscription)

These features are great when you have to wait on a charge, but most cars are meant to be driven and by law can not play movies/games while in drive. Regardless, you can stream video with car play on a variety of dirt cheap cars if sitting a stationary car is your thing for some reason.

>	autopilot on the freeway all seems super luxurious to me.

Autopilot being a decent argument for the “luxury” catergory but without the $7k FSD upgrade it’s not really all that special compared to the other manufacturer’s offerings. 

To me (though I understand this is subjective) the most important aspects of a luxury car are ride comfort, cabin noise, and interior appearance/quality. Which at the moment, the Model 3 lacks compared to Luxury offerings (though I know some poeple love the 3’s interior and some hate it); though I will give it some significant points for smooth and responsive EV drive trains are and the convenience of charging at home for people who can do that. 

I think it’s partially based on how people perceive the 3 is a $35k car (whereas an SR+ without FSD is $40k) when in reality a long range with FSD is going to run you $56k

Don’t get me wrong, the 3 is good; but compared to car’s of similar price, it’s got some catching up to do in the luxury department."
which ones? Mercedes C? have you ever being in one?
"Mid/high end golfs, or a GTI/R are a great balance.

I love clarksons quote of a GTI being all the car you really need. It’s so true."
"What other luxury cars don't have is adequate range with no ICE.  For me, that is why I replaced an S-class Mercedes with my Model 3.  Once I had the M3, I discovered that it is virtually stressless on a long road trip compared to the S.  Apparently world-class noise isolation, air suspension, and fancy seats can be overcome by an electric motor, a battery, and world-class engineering and software in my case."
You’re misusing the word toxic.
"Fair about the price, but if you look at the opposite being if the Model 3 was sold at $20k it wouldn’t even be considered luxury. 

Most BMWs, Mercedes, and Audi all have leatherette options as well. So when one is purchased with leatherette does that make it a non-luxury car compared to the same model with leather?"
"Fair enough, but if the Tesla was sold at $20k it would be less likely to be considered luxury. There is a starting point in price for the luxury category. That was my point."
"they generate money in Europe selling A-C class autos (in Germany one has to include E).S while being ""effective"" is irrelevant as a money maker. Even less than X (which is also a money cow) for Tesla."
"I had that attitude about the cost too... but I’m (slowly) coming to the realization that it doesn’t really cost more, long term. Sure, you’re buying two sets but only one pair is being used and worn down at a time... both will last longer. Time your swaps around your rotations and it won’t even be that inconvenient.

I may get some winters next year. Maybe my mind will be blown with the difference."
one thing you didnt mention that i remember from watching a rolls royce video on youtube is that super expensive cars dont “feel the road”. im nkt sure that i am articulting it right but its like no matter how bumpy the road you dont feel it and the ride stays smooth. how do they do that? also i remember as a kid seeing a car with headlight wipers and being incredulous that that was a thing. is that still a thing? massaging chairs and cooling as weel as heating is probably a thing too right? and shouldnt the glass panels opacity be adjustable?
"Totally agree. The quality of the leather is a big one. My friend's 15 year old Mercedes was fitted with leather that is so high in quality that it still looks new. It's thick, buttery, and smells incredible. The Tesla interior quality is more akin to that of a top trim Kia or Toyota, 

And the quiet cabin. People who talk about how quiet their Model 3 is have likely never taken a road trip in a Lexus or a higher spec Mercedes. They are whisper quiet in the cabin. In contrast, while the Model 3 has no engine noise, it has considerable road noise and wind noise."
"Hyundais do this nowadays, the app thing."
Don't confuse a luxury brand with a luxury car. All luxury brands still sell low end models.
"C-class Mercedes are a pile. Mazda 3s and Corollas are nicer cars with more luxury features, like continuing to function without major service after 80,000 miles. And unlike a C-class, you wouldn’t be embarrassed to be seen in one."
"I own a GTE - it's a fantastic car. Perfect balance of luxury (comfortable, sporty) and economy (it's expensive but not proper luxury car expensive.)"
"A car is a tool, transportation for a price. Dollar for dollar it competes against cars in the luxury class, that doesn't mean it is itself luxury. All that says is if you can spend $50k, here are the other comparable (4 door, interior volume, etc) cars you can get for $50k.

There is no defining line. GM makes decidedly non luxury cars, on average. They do offer luxury packages, and even some models, but the bulk is just a car. The same range applies to so called premium brands, except the general deal is luxury, but offer less expensive versions or makes.

Although a low end merc may compare to a high end Chevy, that doesn't mean that on average Chevy and Mercedes are direct competitors."
Because it does cost a certain amount to make something luxurious while still retaining basic functionality.
"I never said they don't make money on the A-C class, nor has any other comment in here. So, again, what am I missing?"
Yeah that’s exactly the way to do it. All seasons rubber is not made to withstand cold temperatures.. it literally freezes and cracks when it get’s really cold.

"CLA, lol. Or BMW base 3 series lease specials. 

The CLA is an embarrassment. Says a lot about a person to see someone drive one."
"what to confuse? I sit sometimes in Mercedes C which costs 45k, I sit (more often) in Tesla Model 3 which costs 49k. Tesla model 3 has significantly better plastic, better chairs, and better material on these chairs, the entertainment center is just no comparison. 
and of course there is the frigging full glass roof which still makes a trip somewhere the Trip.

The only possible advantage for Mercedes would be if  to service car in Germany but dutch Tesla service presence improves considerably and hopefully will match best concurrence levels. Own Mercedes service centers are the thing still."
"I don't get you guys. You talk about ""luxury"" cars, when pointed obvious facts (at least obvious facts for the people living in the Netherlands) that Tesla 3 is very competitive in it's price range (and Tesla S and Tesla X in theirs), you change subject. There are many more C-class mercedes cars on the road than Mazda's 3.

People who buy Corrolas would never even think about MB C. They buy Tesla's though. 
People who buy MB C would never look into ""simple cars"" or ""sport cars"". They buy Tesla's though.

The fact is, when presented locally Teslas eat other brands. 
While slowing down (plenty of dutch companies used next year budget to buy cars now) Tesla will remains one of the leaders in 2020 as well."
"Exactly my point, there is no defining line. Everyone that sits in my car perceives it as luxury, just as they did in my BMWs. It doesn’t have to do with rarity, leatherette vs leather, etc. It’s the overall car. Defining luxury has gotten more complex these days and that’s the point. The definition of luxury changes with time. 

At the end of the day I don’t even care if the Model 3 is luxury or not. I’ve gone 17,000 miles and not once had to stop to recharge, the car can pick me up in a parking lot, and it’s the most fun I’ve ever had with a car."
Yep
"Maybe others are in the same boat and just don’t know what they’re missing having never used them...

Maybe I just don’t drive enough - 40 km/day on average... I have a short commute.

When I finally make that jump I’m considering just getting separate winter wheels to avoid the rebalancing."
"thats all really cool stuff. is alot of this in or an option im the model s? i remember reading about how elon put all these random features like apocalypse mode, so he would at least include the usual luxury features everyone else has."
"I’m not saying anything about Tesla, just chipping in my opinion that the C-class is not a good car and nobody should buy one. The only German car anyone should ever consider buying is a Porsche, and even then, one must understand what that purchase means in terms of cost of ownership. They’re the only German manufacturer whose products actually keep their value.

Also in the US there are significantly more Mazda 3s than C-classes. Especially older ones, since the Mazdas haven’t been junked yet."
I do agree that what used to define luxury is changing. It is no surprise that technology is quickly becoming a stronger indicator then it once was

100% agree with you!
"jeez. billionaire elon musk really needs to design a tesla for his income bracket. maybe thats on the backburnee till the company matures a bit more. they probably wouldnt sell too many of those and it would operate at a loss and be more of a statement. really cool,stuff, thanks for taking the time to explain :)"

I've heard of phantom braking while in Autopilot. Not acceleration though
"It is unwise to describe any failure condition as *impossible*, but it is perfectly reasonable to suggest that it is [extremely improbable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_25.1309-1)."
"Of course it is not possible. However, slamming the brakes at 80mph is very probable when a ghost jumps in front of your car on an empty highway."
Just like Toyota. Or any other car with functioning brakes.
"I am sure this person is correct, and the people crashing their cars weren't doing what they thought they were. 

I have direct experience with this and the confusion it causes (luckily in a safe environment). I used to race cars at the amateur level and once, during a particularly intense AutoX event I was in my BMW M3 (powerful, RWD vehicle) and got into a difficult turn that required full braking quickly followed by immediate near 100% acceleration . I had done my initial braking too late and was in the process of lifting from the brake when I realized my speed was still far too high, so I had to full-press the brake to scrub the last few bit of speed before taking the corner. Unfortunately, in my flustered state I applied full pressure to the gas instead, spun the car twice and ended up off course. I was totally confused as what happened, even though I had been racing for years and generally knew a darn lot about driving fast. 

I can totally see how a generally clueless person who really never thought about driving dynamics before could unintentionally mash that gas pedal and end up in a wall, as when that happens it takes the brain a second to actually realize what is happening and do something. The muscle memory for braking is vastly different from accelerator pedal, you generally press firm and hard on brakes, whereas gas is feathered and light. If you press the accelerator even close to how you do the brake, in a powerful fast car, you will be flying in no time."
Thanks for the gold 🥇
"When I first got my Tesla, I went to a family gathering and talked to a guest that previously had one.  He wasted no time in telling me how much he hated Tesla because he claims it accelerated into a wall all on its own.  He insisted he was not at fault - it was most definitely the car.  

He did everything he could to get Tesla to pay for it.  He says they looked up the data from the incident and let him know that HE actually pressed the accelerator pedal.  He was adamant that he didn't.  

Anyway I just took that with a grain of salt because he was elderly, and you know ... I've seen my share of elderly folks slamming into walls with regular ICE vehicles so ..."
Impossible....... extremely unlikely maybe but impossible is a very very bold and impossible statement.
"Autopilot controls acceleration, so it is possible to accelerate without touching the accelerator pedal, ergo unintended acceleration is possible via autopilot malfunction.

I don't believe Tesla's have a problem with this, I think people stomp on the wrong pedal, but it's possible."
It's single pedal driving. People's brains start to confuse the accelerator for the brake.
"I think what the biggest issue is that if you accidentally hit the accelerator in an ICE car, you hear the engine rev and there is a slight delay before the torque ramps up enough to make the car move far and you can let off and realize your mistake before you do to much damage but that still doesnt stop people from making the mistake.   

In a Tesla there is no engine rev and the torque is instant so people are more likely to believe they were hitting the brake instead of the accelerator.  So in their mind it is easier to blame the car than their driving skills."
"So while this all makes sense, there is a scenario not covered (I'm surprised it's not mentioned here).  I did have an odd occurrence happen once that could probably be repeated.  I didn't have a crash, but it did catch me by surprise.

I have my car set to creep mode.  Once on an earlier firmware (\~1 year ago?) I went to back out of the garage and the computer part had crashed.  I still have occasional crashes on ""starting"" the car, but since you can still shift into drive (or reverse) when the computer is down, it's not a big deal.  However, with the computer crashed, the creep mode didn't activate.  So, I had to use the accelerator to move, which I did.  A few seconds into backing out, the computer re-activated, and roll mode kicked in.  I wasn't quite expecting that to happen, so there was a bit of extra acceleration that happened as a result that caught me off guard.

Of course, the speeds I'm talking about here are slow, in the 0-3? 4? mph range.  Nonetheless, I'm quite confident that it was an unintended acceleration, simply because the car is able to accelerate on its own, by design, with no accelerator pedal pressing.

On the flip side of this when using autopilot I regularly get ""unintended"" acceleration as it handles the various ghosts and merging/diverging cars.  Not unintended in the sense that it wasn't supposed to accelerate, but unintended in the sense that the car is doing faster acceleration than a normal driver would do given the situation.  It's common to get a lurching feeling as it moves around given certain circumstances, and it's improved in that regard over the time I've had the car with various firmware updates.

I would love to see the logs from my instances!"
"Maybe it's impossible for the computer to read a false pedal position, but it's not impossible for the computer to decide to apply torque anyways."
It only happens to the Prius.
"There was a bug widely reported on this subreddit 2 months ago where the car would suddenly accelerate in the wrong direction on slopes because of a bug with Hold Mode. [Example.](https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/druwde/nearly_had_a_minor_fender_bender_issue_with_hold/)

So it’s pretty rich to see all these posts insisting it’s impossible for the car to accelerate without pressing the pedal. This literally just happened, it’s like everyone forgot.

Teslas are computers on wheels. The wheels and pedals are controlled by foolproof mechanical systems which can basically never fail in such a way to cause the system to read a false press of the pedal or cause the motors to turn unintentionally. Unfortunately, these systems are controlled by software being continually updated over time by overworked engineers and as we’ve seen, the software can tell the motors to spin when it should not. So all the arguments saying unintended acceleration is impossible because the hardware has a ridiculous amount of redundancy are completely ignoring the fact that a software issue could conceivably cause (and has caused in the past) unintended accelerations to happen.

Tesla has given a statement that every case they’ve checked has shown that the user pressed the pedal. That’s great for them, but “we checked and it’s fine” is never going to be good enough. This kind of thing requires an independent investigation."
"Just as anyone who is even remotely technical suspected, the entire Tesla fak3 n3ws acceleration thing is just that: F3ke N3ws.

Tesla  has a giant target on their backs. Any stories related to Tesla make corporate media a ton of money with each article, and all the big companies hate Tesla because they're an industry disrupter and unbelievably successful.

edit: Lol, the term f3ke n3ws is banned on this sub. Mods, are you out of your minds?"
"Yeah the problem is that they are (mostly) the fastest car anyone has ever driven. They mess up doing 0 to 100, wreck, and of course don't want to take the blame. It is the same as someone who has never ride a motorcycle and then buys FZR-1000 as the first bike. Guess what happens next?"
"omg let NHTSA do their job. not trusting some random ""hacker"" to assure me"
"Just last year, my 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo unintentionally accelerated on the highway during rush hour while I was trying to merge into a busy off-ramp. Luckily, I had just enough room to maneuver out from between a whole bunch of cars without hitting anyone and pulled over to the side before my engine exploded. Turns out my throttle cable got stuck on a coolant hose clamp.

Can't wait to get my first pre-owned EV."

"The nomenclature used here is wrong. If a person accidentally stomps the accelerator when they mean to step on the brakes that's still an 'unintended acceleration'. Every (or nearly every) case of a car slamming forward into a storefront or a garage is honestly an 'unintended acceleration' because the driver didn't intend it.

We need to use a different label to represent acceleration not stemming from a user input, or one that is a malfunction during a normal user input."
It's not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my T16 back home. They're not much bigger than two meters.
Would a Model 3 attempt to avoid a rear collision if it detected one incoming? Do we have a safety feature for this? Wife says she just had our 3 lurch forward when it detected something close on the display.
What about when the throttle cable gets frayed and stuck. Keep it greased folks.
"Read it as possible first, impossible is a lot better!"
"To be clear - I think autopilot is a good thing, and I think the probability is high that most if not all of these crashes were driver responsibility.

That being said, anyone who trusts self-logging of cars is not going to persuade me.  I'm pleased to see that there are redundant sensors and independent analysis, but you can't really draw any conclusions without an FMEA of the hardware.  Even in safety-certified applications (note: the US government does not regulate automotive software, and anecdotal evidence does not seem to indicate that Tesla is interested in complying with industry standards) logging subsystems are as non-critical a part of the system as it can get.  That is the least scrutinized software in the car.

So, for an oversimplified example, let's say the car is logging a pair of contact switches.  They have independent hardware and separate inputs on the controller / logger, and it measures current flowing through the switch, e.g. zero when open, 20mA when closed.  Contact switches have to agree for some action to be taken.

What happens when the low side of one switch gets shorted to the low side of the other?  Now when that switch closes, both inputs have current flowing - they agree, the logger shows both switches have the same value, and the controller takes the programmed action.

What happens when a programming error interferes with the logger, and the address for the inputs for the two contact switches are overwritten, changing the logging software so it is looking at inputs 3 and 4 (disabled) instead of 1 and 2 (connected to the switches)?  The controller takes action based on the contact switches, but the logs show something different.

Again, I'm not saying there aren't solutions for these issues, and I'm not saying that Tesla hasn't taken them.  What I'm saying is that anyone who takes logging data at face value is naive."
Holy hell a whole article about a twitter thread with no link to said twitter thread. Can we ban this trash site from the sub?
"I wouldn't be super surprised if there was a version of software that had a rare issue with acceleration and that it was patched in the next version.

That would still make the official statement true and would make it impossible to find an issue in the current cars.

There are too many people in a local Tesla FB group I'm in who experienced a handful of acceleration issues (but didn't result in any kind of accidents) between late October and early December, but then never again. Each one would say it was 1-2 times in those couple months, they contacted Tesla, never heard anything back, and then it hasn't happened since."
Please god don’t say stuff in cybersec is impossible unless you want to be laughed at

Bugs can't happen? Famous last words.
"Tesla have designed this system right but even in ""regular"" cars it's common to have a two or three CPU setup that cross-checks data to ensure overspeed doesn't occur.

One exception was Toyota, as their software engineering was so bad that it was possible to lock up an interrupt handler and have an accelerator pedal continue to read as depressed.  I believe the flaw there was that Toyota were not using multiple redundant processors."
"So system engineering is at least a decent portion to what I do professionally these days (not in the automotive industry, but a lot of the philosophies are cross-applicable), and I want to bring up a couple things, at the risks of being annoying pedantic:

1. It is pretty much meaningless to claim a complex system to be 100% failure proof. Even the most redundantly safeguarded systems can be brought down by [low likelihood unforeseen circumstances](https://www.wired.com/story/cosmic-ray-showers-crash-supercomputers-heres-what-to-do-about-it/) or even simple human errors during solution design, implementation, testing or deployment. Hell, low probability events like compromised/malicious actors can also be a failure cause. 

2. That being said, it is also a fool's errand to chase after absolutely 0% error rate with brute force. Sure you can add layers and layers of redundancies, but it will soon reach a point of diminishing returns as far as risk mitigation goes and your resource cost will become prohibitive. The best systems are also designed with error detection capability and the ability to recover or fail *gracefully* in irrecoverable events.

In the end, from what we've learned from Tesla it seems like that their system design is about as good as automotive software can be expected. They properly installed redundancy checks (many of them industry standard) in different layers of the throttle/braking system, and even added additional components like Obstacle Aware Acceleration to further mitigate severity of failure cases (even though it's mostly designed to safeguard against human error). At this point I think debating whether the failure rate is *exactly* zero is a moot point, since unless some new unexpected info comes to light it seems like Tesla's system is as safe as that of any other automakers, which is to say error probability is negligible (I was gonna say *infinitesimal*, but people can get very pedantic, as shown by my own comment lol)."

The pedal hardware itself contains two independent sensors that must agree as well. This way, only a genuine pedal input will cause torque to be commanded. There are additional crosschecks of this in other modules as well, such as the ABS.

This is obviously not the entire story, otherwise cruise control, Autopilot or self-driving would be impossible, all of which happen without any pedal input. There is software which can command the drive unit on its own, and where there is software there can be bugs."
Awesome! I needed this. I had a concerned coworker warn me yesterday about the unintended acceleration and couldn't find any information.
"How does this account for the 'escape mode' when it accelerates away from an impending rear collision?

If there's something that triggers it based on the cameras or sensors, couldn't that input be spoofed to have the same effect?"
Is this the first case of a hacker defending a product he hacks?
"This is definitely an issue, but that’s mostly due to the cameras seeing something that isn’t there (shadows, gantries etc)"
"Yeah, when the car thinks there something in the path or when something is approaching it’s path"
Ive had phantom braking / false positive both in my Nissan Qashqai and Volvo XC40.
I had this happen just a few days ago. My wife and daughter in the backseat didn’t appreciate it! Lol
Mine seems to always break when seeing a shadow of a highway overhead sign.
"> phantom braking

Fuck yes this happens.  Happened many times on a 3 hour road trip just recently."
"Phantom braking is definitely a thing.  I probably have it happen about twice a month, which with my driving would be about 1 instance per 500 miles on AP."
I just had a massive phantom brake/AEB episode while _not_ on autopilot. That stuff can be scary.
"I've personally experienced unintended acceleration on autopilot. Always happened on same stretch of road same spot. First time it happened it scared me a bit.  I think it's a mix of the car not knowing the current speed limit on the road and having your desired speed of + more than the speed limit.  If you turn on autopilot on a stretch of road say at 59mph in a 55mph zone, the car will go that speed. Once it sees or knows what the speed limit is it will accelerate to your setting, mine was always +11mph, without you making a change. So the car would always jump to 66mph. Definitely unintentional and startling if not expecting it. Edit: not sure why the down votes, this a legit scenario that can happen and I've  experienced.   https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8mfflx/sudden_acceleration_in_autopilot"
"You’re probably right, but if you read the article, he has some convincing arguments that imply an actual impossibility.
From his perspective has an extremely accomplished 3rd party Tesla engineer, he could not, even if he disabled the brake sensors entirely, figure out a way to FORCE the car to rapidly accelerate without actual pedal input. Even when he was overriding systems and changing the software. Sounds pretty convincing."
"True, but he's putting ""skin in the game"" because he's offering a gentleman's bet. He will pay anyone who can demonstrate unintended acceleration while mashing on the brakes and allow him to scan the logs while demonstrating it."
What kind of ghost?
Thank god it's a beta program that explicitly warns you to stay alert
"Also, people trust their memories way too much. They think they were steeping on the brake and even after accelerating *still* believe they were stepping on the brake. Nothing short of a video showing that they were hitting the accelerator could convince some people otherwise, and even then I bet at least a few would believe the video was doctored rather than doubt their own memory."
[deleted]
"Someone had to say it. I mean if the car has auto pilot and can adjust its own speed, then surely there *could* be some weird anomalies with acceleration without human input. Improbabale, sure."
"His full argument is that even if the car were to accelerate unexpectedly, the brakes are more than twice as powerful as the car's maximum torque and would still be able to stop the car. So he means that it's physically impossible for the car to accelerate in such a way that slamming the brakes wouldn't stop it.

At the least you'd need some sort of unknown accelerator state plus the brakes physically failing at the same time. You could still argue that's 'possible' as is shuffling a deck of 52 cards and have it end up in order. But the earth will be consumed by the sun long before that would happen. That's good enough to be 'impossible' in my book.

Otherwise, as Dr_Pippin said, nothing's impossible as absurdly demonstrated with the Infinite Improbability Drive in the Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy."
Nothing is impossible. But at some point you round down to zero.
In fact it does it all the time with cruise control.
"But the Prius doesn't even have \*intended\* acceleration...

"Weren't some cases deemed caused by 3rd party floor mats catching the pedal?

Even still, though, mashing the brakes should've stopped."
"You failed to understand the issue.

If the car decides to accelerate, it will be in the logs due to the redundancy setup.

There is no way the car can accelerate without it showing in the logs. That’s the crux of the issue.

If there is a ghost in the machine pressing the virtual accelerator? It will show in the logs.

NB: In the case of unintended acceleration? Logs verify that meat bag AI did indeed press the accelerator. Not the machine AI."
But you can always apply the brakes and the acceleration stops.

"No. ""We checked and it's fine"" is a flippant way to phrase it, but that is the industry standard. They're liable if it turns out they lied about checking logs, but it's not feasible to send the NTSB or whomever on a wild goose chase every time someone tries to blame a car for their own mistake. The alternative would mean that automakers would employ armies of drivers to report false bugs to bog down competitors."
"I think the reason for the down votes is misunderstanding and poor communication from others.

The truth is it is 110% possible for the Tesla software to command acceleration without input from the driver. The impossible thing is the operator pressing the brakes and the car registering the press of the accelerator in the logs. 

I don't get what users are trying to imply by saying you just need to press the brakes. I've driven a Tesla, if an anomaly commanded 100% power due to a gyro glitch you could be through the storefront before you even think of pressing the brakes."
"Separate issue, but worth considering since there IS the software route for vehicle acceleration."

"More like they know bugs happen, that’s why they engineered layers upon layers of redundancy."
"A whole design philosophy called Fault Tolerant Computing has become a major part of software development that focuses entirely on preventing problems like these. There's a strong belief from some circles that the original 'unintended acceleration' stories from Toyota were a result of a new generation of hardware and software that was more prone to errors/bit-flipping and not protected against it.

These new systems involve multiple inputs all requiring having matching values, and stored data within a system is stored in multiple locations in memory so that events like bit-flips don't trigger unintended consequences. And if a value is found to not line up, the system is reset to a determined safe output (in this case, cutting power).

While I don't work at Tesla, and don't have access to their hardware, everything that was stated is a) easy, b) cheap, and c) well within the realm of possibility to implement."
"Bugs can and will happen the more complexity and abstract layers you put on. From what I understand the drive unit with basic inputs like acceleration, brake, or steering is pretty low level and robustly designed that you would have to have multiple very specific and very improbably hardware failures on the sensor side to line up as misrepresented correct state. Everything which doesn't look right defaults to error which doesn't lead to more acceleration."
"You didn’t read it, did you?"
">  I believe the flaw there was that Toyota were not using multiple redundant processors.

I wonder if the people responsible left to work for Boeing?"
My parents volvo from 2008 had to get a new throttle pedal because one of the sensors stopped giving the correct readings and the car wouldn't accelerate at all. I think this is pretty standard practice and has been for quite a while.
"That’s actually not true (despite the massive settlement). People have offered $1million for proof that unintended acceleration was possible and it’s never been proven. Check out Malcolm Gladwell’s podcast Revisionist History, it’s a very good listen."
">Tesla have designed this system right but even in ""regular"" cars it's common to have a two or three CPU setup that cross-checks data to ensure overspeed doesn't occur.

Drive-by-wire throttles have been a solved problem for two decades or more, I very sincerely hope that Tesla went with an off-the-shelf component rather than reinvent their own."
I thought the flaw was the [cheap floor mats that would slide up on top of the pedal.](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a15125313/its-all-your-fault-the-dot-renders-its-verdict-on-toyotas-unintended-acceleration-scare-feature/)
Just not in large commercial aircraft.  Single point of failure is very in fashion
"Read this report: https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/pubs/koopman14_toyota_ua_slides.pdf
Toyota violated nearly every design principle of safety-critical embedded systems. They did have a “safety processor,” but ran both throttle inputs to it, which one was then forwarded to the main CPU. Each CPU should have its own independent input. They had thousands of global variables, and the watchdog timer was reset on a timer interrupt. The whole CPU can be dead, but the watchdog will never reset."
">it was possible to lock up an interrupt handler and have an accelerator pedal continue to read as depressed

Even then, the brakes could overpower the engine and stop the vehicle if someone actually pressed the brake."
But they discovered that all those cases were people pressing the gas by mistake
Do you have a link for the Toyota?
I don't think I have ever seen a modern fuel injected vehicle with multiple redundant CPUs in the engine computer.
">  meaningless to claim a complex system to be 100% failure proof.

"Quality comment, but you have my upvote for getting the song Infinitesimal in my head"
"Everybody is talking about the pedal sensors and redundant systems, but the reality is that it might have nothing to do with the pedal sensor. All that needs to happen to make the motor turn is to give it power. However they handle the turning on/off of power to the motor could have the issue. It's probably just people being embarrassed that they crashed their $70,000 car though............"
"Good insight! Though I might argue that, at least from the end user's perspective, a system \_can\_ have a 0% error rate if it is capable of failing gracefully 100% of the time. Of course I'd never hold my own code to that high standard... I'm not that dumb."

"That not unintended, it’s doing what you told it, +11.  That’s like saying when you activate autopilot it “unintentionally” turns the steering wheel to keep you in the lane"
Because that is not what's been talking about.
"The nature of bugs is that sometimes they can be difficult to replicate _intentionally_, as the same way those who built/QA'd the feature missed some edge case parameter which caused the bug, so too when trying to replicate it said parameter can be missed.

This in no way assumes there is an SUA issue here, rather just gives some perspective on the flip side of the ""unable to replicate"" argument."
"10^-9 per operating hour is a pretty robust standard. 

There are 8760 hours in a year, so this implies one event should be expected every 114,115 operating years. 

Cars are parked about 90% of the time, so you'd expect about one event every million ownership years if this standard was achieved.

At mass market scales, extremely improbable events will happen in the wild from time to time.

"I had an incident where after putting my Model 3 into drive, I felt that the accelerator pedal map was messed up. 

Feathering the accelerator pedal lightly caused a torque output equal to what I would typically consider a full quarter press of the pedal.  I immediately let off the pedal and tried a couple more time with the same ""power surge"" result. Lucky I was in an open parking lot so nothing happened. 

I put the car back in park and shifted back to drive and the car's pedal mapping returned to ""normal"".

It was pretty freaky and I reported it right away. It hasn't happened since."
"1.	This article does not say that.
2.	If the logs would expose unintended acceleration, then the logs need to be independently verified.
3.	The title claims that unintended acceleration is IMPOSSIBLE, not that if it happens it will be noted down in the logs."
I don't think I trust that logs capture every erroneous event.
"Probably true, definitely not the point. The guy in the article claims unintentional acceleration is impossible."
"If you think I’m saying that the issue I posted is the same issue that the claims against Tesla are about, I’m not saying that at all. I’m saying that Tesla cars have accelerated without the driver pressing the pedal, because there was a software bug that told the motor to turn when it shouldn’t have. This article is claiming that to be literally impossible.

Edit: to clarify, the cases I saw posted about had the car accelerate when the driver was letting off of the accelerator, so technically they had their foot on it but it should have been slowing down, not speeding up."
"You’re right. I thought the NHTSA has actually launched an investigation but all they’ve actually done is take the petition and add it to their agenda to look over. Basically they need to decide if it’s worth investigating or not. If they do decide to look into it then that’s their prerogative.

I was more trying to make clear that claims like these are something that an independent party needs to evaluate. If the NHTSA decides there isn’t enough evidence to look into it further then that’ll be the end of it. But that needs to be a step in the process. We can’t just take Tesla’s word for it that there isn’t a problem if a substantial number of people are claiming that there is, even if the claims look fishy."
There is an acceleration rate limit for computer-instructed acceleration (Autopilot).

"I'm no engineer but I'm guessing there's a competing pressure from the sales guys to not create too many failure points from the perspective of the consumer.

Simply taking a car out and pressing on both pedals is not an effective way to test software. I was also really disappointed that they completely ignored Michael Barr’s research and trial testimony. He identified specific lines of code and systemic defects that could cause throttle lock up. He had more time and examined a broader section of Toyota’s code than the NHSTA/NASA team has. His testimony is a big reason why the court cases have gone against Toyota. And as far that $1mil prize, if I’m not mistaken the terms of that requires disclosure of Toyota intellectual property. Any professional engineer with access to that source code knows they are going to get swiftly sued if they disclosure that code to anyone who isn’t also authorized. Hell, the slides used in the court cases against Toyota had to be redacted before they could be publicly released.

"It is a little more complicated than just feeding DC power to the motors, that would do nothing in the case of motors of almost any current electric vehicle since they use some form of Alternating Current to power the motors.  That in turn requires an inverter to start up and provide exact AC waveforms to the motor which vary based on the commanded torque.  This is in part why Tesla has an extra processor monitoring the pedal as the inverter its self has a role in determining the pedal status.  

TLDR: Providing DC power direct to the motor would not provide any propulsion."
"But the logs indicate that the pedal is being pressed.  If the logs indicated that the pedal wasn't being pressed, that theory would bear investigation.

It is remotely possible that an electronics error could cause the pedal sensors to simultaneously malfunction; the logs would then indicate that the pedal was depressed.  This still seems far-fetched, but saying ""the logs show pedal movement"" at least isn't an instant response to that theory."
It's definitely people who don't want to admit they fucked up being egged on and promoted by shorts. I don't understand how this isn't obvious to anyone without skin in the game.

More reasons why [intellectual property is wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/eq4ydi/intellectual_property_is_wrong/).
Floor mat was just the scapegoat.  A simple fact that brakes are much stronger than the engine and will stop the car even if the accelerator is fully pressed.  So they were not pressing the brakes in those cases.  Only thing floor mats could of done was change the feel and position of the pedals a bit to help the pedal confusion along.
"..and  unacceptance that it was possible or more likely that they accidentally stepped on the gas instead of the brake, and when the car went forward, they pushed harder on the ""brake"" in panic."
"This episode was considered controversial in its presentation of hypothesis as fact.  I think the Toyota Bit Flip hypothesis has been largely debunked as was the airliner incident they mentioned in the episode. From what I understand this episode is just slightly above ""Maybe it was ancient aliens"" level of programming."
I’ll check that out!
Radio lab sucks
"You would be right.

Toyota did end up recalling vehicles due to a faulty accelerator pedal design that would allow the pedal to get stuck in a non-zero state and they also added a system that would override accelerator inputs if the brake pedal was depressed since that was not a standard part of their drive-by-wire system.  Tesla has that other system already in place since day one but a faulty accelerator pedal that does not reset back to 0 could trick multiple redundant position sensors.

>**What is the problem that could cause accelerators to stick and led to the recall?**  

>The issue involves a friction device in the pedal designed to provide the proper “feel” by adding resistance and making the pedal steady and stable. 
 
>This friction device includes a “shoe” that rubs against an adjoining surface during normal pedal operation.  **Due to the materials used, wear and environmental conditions, these surfaces may, over time, begin to stick and release instead of operating smoothly. In some cases, friction could increase to a point that the pedal is slow to return to the idle position or, in rare cases, the pedal sticks, leaving the throttle partially open.**

>...

>**What are the specific measures of the vehicle-based remedy you are using to address the potential for floor mats to entrap the pedal?**  

> The remedy is as follows:

> 1. The shape of the accelerator pedal will be reconfigured to address the risk of floor mat entrapment, even when an older-design all-weather floor mat or other inappropriate floor mat is improperly attached, or is placed on top of another floor mat.  For the ES350, Camry, and Avalon models involved, the shape of the floor surface underneath will also be reconfigured to increase the space between the accelerator pedal and the floor.

> 2. Vehicles with any genuine Toyota or Lexus accessory all-weather floor mat will be provided with newly-designed replacement driver- and front passenger-side all-weather floor mats.

>**In addition, as a separate measure independent of the vehicle-based remedy, Toyota will install a brake override system onto the involved Camry, Avalon, and Lexus ES 350, IS 350 and IS 250 models as an extra measure of confidence. This system cuts engine power in case of simultaneous application of both the accelerator and brake pedals.**

>The recall remedies for accelerator pedal entrapment for the Corolla, Matrix, Venza, Highlander, Tacoma, Tundra, and Prius will occur on a rolling schedule during 2010.  No details have been provided to this point.  Please note that the Prius, and all hybrids for that matter, already have a version of the override system.  The override system will be standard by the end of 2010."
Came here to say this
"Ya. You are right. My example was not very good. My point is that something ""weird"" could have happened that falls outside of the bounds of the redundant systems. A better example that I thought of would be a caching issue that causes the redundant systems to look at the pedal position data from 5 seconds ago instead of the current pedal position data. This would ""fool"" every redundant system."
Logs are only 100% the truth if the log writing is not messed up.
"Ya, my scenario probably has lots of holes in it. All I am saying is that I have learned from 9 years of software development that it is really hard to say with 100% confidence that something is impossible. Another scenario I just came up with off the top of my head is that maybe one of the developers wrote a test that simulates the pedal going up and down and a mis-type caused that test to be compiled and called in some scenarios. Maybe a caching issue causes the software to read the pedal sensor state from 5 seconds ago instead of the current time. Maybe the redundant systems use some sort of 3rd party ""redundancy"" library that has a bug in it. Maybe the autopilot system that ""limits"" the car to 15 mph is stuck reading the current speed at 7 mph so it continues to accelerate trying to get up to 15 mph but never does. My point is that with edge cases, it is almost always a ""weird"" thing that is happening that was overlooked because it is ""weird""."
"Technically 0% covers anything less than .5%, as only one significant digit is given. If you understand 0% to denote 0.000000000000000...%, then, to be consistent, you'd have to similarly understand, *e.g.*, 80% to mean 80.000000000000000...%. Since we can't and don't normally specify things to infinitesimal levels of accuracy, the more reasonable way to understand percentage scales--and the reason we talk in percentages at all--is that they imply a precision of ±.005."
"I'm a software developer myself. If you have 6 different pieces of code checking simple condition written by different people and core reviewed, running on separate hardware, chances of failure are pretty slim.

Not sure about acceleration thing- I don't own a Tesla."
"I mean, if you want to be technical about it, it's almost always just a reduction in them rather than a lack of."
"Nothing exists except the third Wednesday of every other month.


Oh and the first month is actually September, humans got it wrong."
Yeah it's from the cameras picking up stuff usually. Radar can't pick up shadows
"It’s both.  My car routinely brakes for some overhead power lines near my house, even at night when they’re essentially invisible."
"It is the radar. It sees a solid object like a sign or bridge that due to the angle it believes is standing in the road.

edit: if your eyesight was at the level of the radar sensors you'd get what i mean. The cameras in center/top of windshield won't have that problem, but processing the data with HW2.5 is not possible. This is where HW3 reigns supreme."
"that one is different, and I run into that in some areas of new construction where they added new exits and overpasses. annoying to have my cruise control drop from 70 to 45."
You can set it to behave that way
"It does, but like you said the issue is that the car doesn't always know the speed limit and sometimes thinks it changed. I have an issue on my drive to work where my car thinks the highway becomes a non-highway road with a 60 mph speed limit (so my offset doesn't get applied). This limit makes no sense because the speed limit has been 55 mph max for decades all around this location, and is currently 45 due to construction. Anyway, I can be driving along at 75 mph on AP, and the car will SLAM on the brakes to slow me to 60 mph at the same location every time. It sounds like you have the opposite problem where the speed limit gets either set or reset, which changes your AP speed."
"I made the point that it's a bit silly to say unintended acceleration is ""impossible""; given the description of the system provided, I think ""extremely improbable"" would be more accurate. 

> Without a robust understanding of the way the hardware works, like Hughes has, you can’t rule out a mechanical impossibility right?

Given the description of the system provided in the article, yes, I can:

>The drive units contain at least three distinct pieces of hardware that all simultaneously crosscheck any pedal input. The pedal hardware itself contains two independent sensors that must agree as well. This way, only a genuine pedal input will cause torque to be commanded. There are additional crosschecks of this in other modules as well, such as the ABS.

This is basically a recipe. If all the sensors give a spurious reading which looks like a pedal input then unintended acceleration would result. Of course, if this happens, the chances are that the logs won't know that the acceleration was unintended. 

This is not *impossible*, but it is likely to be extremely improbable."
"I think you underestimate how unlikely 10^-9 events are. This is the sort of thing which you would not expect to experience in more than ten thousand lifetimes.

At this level of improbability we can be talking about a car leaving the factory with a very particular combination of build faults, combined with perhaps a faulty software update and a lightning strike, or a cosmic ray flipping a bit or ten somewhere crucial.

In human terms, it's impossible, but at fleet level if you log a lot of hours then really weird things will happen."
Wouldn't radar be much less prone to error than cameras? And doesn't the majority of phantom braking occur in scenarios that wouldn't affect radar at all?
"Elon said it would be fixed many many times before. Maybe one time he will be right but then it's still only reduced to a fair amount but not entirely 'fixed'.

The AEB performs quite good but the false positive rate is not that good."
"Yeah, he’s never felt this way before."
"There are impossibilities in the world though. For instance, a positively charged particle can only ever attract a negatively charged particle with an electrostatic force. The problem with saying there are impossibilities in these complex systems is because you have no way to prove these impossiblities. Even the most accomplished QA engineer can't emulate every possible state of a car's system. They can only simulate the most likely states."
"Not sure why you mention autopilot, I never said anything about it.

I referred to cases where a car with Hold Mode enabled accelerated up an incline while the driver was releasing the pedal. Hold Mode is meant to bring the car to a stop when you let off the accelerator."
"Early on in the post I linked he mentioned that the car sped up as he let off the accelerator (so technically he had his foot on the pedal but the car should have decelerated and instead it accelerated).

[Here’s a different example.](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dw3vfw/bug_with_hold_mode_on_20193621_car_suddenly/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=post_body)

Specifically the issue I was talking about was the car accelerating instead of decelerating while releasing the pedal on an incline."
"true - I'm just playing armchair engineer here on the hardware side, like all over the car you could add extra sensors, but there would be a diminishing return. I've always wanted temperature sensors everywhere as like an early warning system of anything going bad, brakes, motors, whatever - idk why, maybe just inherently paranoid from my years of driving shitty ICE cars. I picture a cool 3D heat map of the vehicle like you'd see in sci-fi with a sudden hot spot glowing over a brake caliper. sexy computer voice says ""warning - impending failure on right rear caliper"""
"Well, not the ones in the first crash who ended up in the ocean."
*Grounded to the ground!*
you can confirm this by driving car down hill and not touching the pedals. it will accelerate towards the ground!!!!
"Later it was found a [bit-flip caused by stray cosmic rays](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/bit-flip) could lock the throttle.  So that may have been the cause in a few cases.  Fixed later with redundancy.  


That said, if standing on the brakes didn't slow down the car, turning off the ignition or putting it into Neutral would have done the trick for those speeding on the freeway."
This and the moment the brake is used the acceleration is immediately cancelled by the software.
I agree.  The 2 people I knew to have the issue were idiots.
"Logs that match the observed behavior are probably not wrong. The alternative requires two unlikely failures not just to coincide, but also for the log failure to populate the log with garbage data that miraculously matches the most common cause of SUA, i.e. ""pedal misapplication"".

When a theory requires a string of extraordinary coincidences to explain why it's not what it looks like, it's not a good theory. Occam's Razor and all that"
I'm pretty sure the developers at Tesla are way way way above making beginner's mistakes like the ones you mention. I do not think they are average developers. My guess is they're top 2-5%.
"One fiery death per 200 cars would be *really* bad, though."
"I mean, that's even more true."
You might wanna double check the meaning of the word lack
I definitely get phantom braking when there's shadows coming in from the side.
Interesting. I guess best outcome the cars and maps just learn every road in America without having to guess speed limits. Then both of our problems would be fixed.
"I think I can accept this as a scientifically accurate statement, while at the same time saying that for the layman reading a CNN article,  it is, as my British brethren would say, “near as makes no difference”. :)"
"Something like this is beyond weird or improbable, bad software, hardware, every fault you can think of isn't going to suddenly make the volume rocker make the car accelerate right?"
[deleted]
Nope.
"Nope. A concave vs. a convex surface, both the same size physically, would look radically different on a radar return."
"My Subaru Crosstrek uses cameras only and while it’s old so processes things slowly, it never has false positives. 

My Model 3 on the other hand is able to react to things much more smoothly and safely but it has a few areas where I know it will phantom brake if there is a car coming in the opposite lane."
The radar sees a solid object like a sign or bridge that due to the angle it believes is standing in the road.
"False. The particles have mass, therefore they have a gravitational pull. So they are attracted to each other in ways other than electrostatic forces.

But that’s beside the point. We haven’t studied positive particles in every possible physical situational or know if they might interact in a different manner, for example at zero degree Kelvin.

So again, to say it’s impossible when we haven’t studied every possibility is inaccurate. We can never prove impossibility, hence why we should just remove it from the dictionary now if you refuse to round to zero occasionally."
"The control mode for hold mode is similar as for autopilot, with the same mitigation (apply the brake), plus an extra feasible mitigation (let off accelerator)"
"This hold mode bug is not the same thing than what is the subject of the article. It was caused by a fail in the gyroscope if I remember well (only happening on steep slope for that particular update) and the car thought it was going in the correct direction but obviously wasn't. It was still input from the driver (he put himself in reverse + press accelerator), the only error was in the direction of the acceleration applied by the car, not in the input itself (the car doesn't accelerate by itself). :-p"
Thread got dark
my day. ruined.
"Yeah I would call bs on that too.  The acceleration value would not be a single bit.  Odds are it would be a 32 bit floating value between 0 and 1.  You would be more likely to just crash the computer then have it still work with a stuck throttle.

And you are correct turning of the ignition, putting it into neutral, or using the parking brake would be other valid options if they weren't frozen to inaction by panic.

We should put every driver through a scuba diving course.  You learn pretty fast how to suppress your panic and think through the problem when your mask gets knocked off or an issue with the regulator."
"He is referring to the Toyota case I believe. In Tesla it's as simple as insane acceleration plus wrong pedal.

We have chill mode and obstacle aware acceleration for a reason. Partly because ""old fart"" mode might be confusing with ""fart mode"" and to be extra sure, we call it ""emissions testing mode"" to avoid all possible confusions.

I would say a good 60% of that is true, but 100% of the important parts."
"No people here with software/embedded experience are just calling how it is. The headline aka ""it's impossible"" is just plain stupid and ignorant. Even the most stable systems crash and have bugs. Even the most ridiculous bugs and reasons for them. Like the aircrafts that crashed when they crossed a time zone. Planes that have to be restarted in frequent intervals because otherwise some counter goes out of boundary or rolls over. 

They could be using statements to write logs that expect parameters. Value signs can be flipped. Bits that are used in flags be swapped. Just because someone thinks it can't go wrong doesn't mean it is like that.

If their QA on software matches the one for the production of their cars..."
"True, so it's probably worth giving more significant digits after the decimal point."
"The rare actual case of not being wrong, just more correct."
"Lack, noun

The state of being without or not having enough of something. 



There's enough photons for your eyes to detect in almost every shadow you see in daily life. So yes, the use of lack is correct here."
That's a new and different problem related to slowing you down if traffic in adjacent lanes is much slower than you. I also see that around the new construction when an unexpected on-ramp / lane appears
"It makes a big difference at fleet level, when there are huge numbers of vehicles in service, because there is an infinite difference between one incident which might meet the ""extremely improbable"" threshold, and the zero required to meet the ""impossible"" threshold."
At the 10^-9 level the things which go wrong are usually things that you haven't thought of.
Turning the volume up creates vibrations. Vibrations cause a circuit board to shake. The shaking causes a short in the board. The short in the board causes the car to accelerate. Boom. Acceleration.
"Pretty sure the rear sensors in my Ford are picking up the condensation from the exhaust. Makes it hard to take the alerts seriously, but would follow on what you're saying."
Is Ford really using radars in the back for parking applications? Usually that are ultrasonic sensors which are quite different to front facing radars.
"My old boss back in like 2001 backed his caddy into my POS car because it stopped beeping as he turned, and he gunned it; superficial damage to my fender, and an embarrassment for him I think."
This kind of answer is what I'm trading my karma for. Thanks!

"Did you read the post? He let off the accelerator, and the car went *faster*. That’s the specific problem I am referring to. He also talks about the car going the wrong way when he presses the accelerator, that’s a separate issue (also not really acceptable but not what I want to talk about now).

Another example, user released the accelerator and the car slows to a near stop, then immediately reverses without driver input https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dw3vfw/bug_with_hold_mode_on_20193621_car_suddenly/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=post_body

Multiple comments on that citing similar issues with hold mode. Basically hold mode was causing unintended accelerations. Not just where the car didn’t accelerate as expected (wrong acceleration rate, wrong direction) but also acceleration when the driver was releasing the pedal, which this article claims to be impossible"
"If what you say is true then both posts I linked as well as a few commenters are lying or mistaken, since they claim the car increased in speed as they let off the accelerator

Edit: also the hold mode bug is just an example of the article being wrong, not saying it’s the cause of the recent reports

Edit 2: [another hold mode user claiming the car accelerated with their foot off the pedal on an incline](https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dxatx7/shutting_down_pull_over_immediately_then_hold/)"
Fire is actually quite bright.
"Shaka, when the walls fell. 😞"
">The acceleration value would not be a single bit.  Odds are it would be a 32 bit floating value between 0 and 1

Floating value seems like overkill.  You could probably get away with 8-bit precision, so 256 gradations for the throttle (0-255).  That would mean a single flip from  01111111 (127) to 11111111 (255).  That said, this flip would only be momentary, so it would require something else to happen.  The recall also mentions possible stack overflows that could lock the throttle open."
"Or just less wrong, depending on how it works in the original simulation."
No.. I'm taking about shadows from tall trees. We have those here.
Stop trying to make 10^-^9 happen. It's not going happen.
Excellent example - i had a loose ground in my tesla trunk and the bass thumping was literally turning off the rear amp. If you had asked me if the volume slider (not even a knob!) on my Tesla could disable the rear amp I would have said that was ridiculous. Now that's still a few more steps to get to unintended acceleration....
[deleted]
"Yup, exactly."
"From what it sounds like in that post it’s not that the car accelerated, it just stopped decelerating, which is the function of hold mode"
To me that would be near impossible to have acceleration while releasing the pedal in any car since it is always heavily controlled but I don't know it may be a very rare case (without any log to prove it which seems strange) ? Except if they were on cruise control and when removing the foot from the pedal it will accelerate to the set speed. :-p At least the part of the article on the break pedal is absolutely true : I did press both pedals at once when I just got the car (I had a manual gearbox before and wasn't used to automatic ahah) and the car didn't move at all. ^_^
The bottom of the ocean isn’t.
"Boeing, when the planes fell."

"Sure, my point is that it was stored in a variable in megabytes of ram and used by firmware running on a processor to control the engine. Way beyond messing with assembly directly and performing bit operations by hand."
"It is, with a very low probability."
"Thanks. Your discription is perfectly accurate for problems with ultrasonic sensors.

Unfortunately people mix up all the pros and cons about the ADAS sensors so that discussions in here often lead to nothing."
"From the post

>	As the car was getting to a stop (more precisely as soon as it hit 1mph), it bolted backward at full speed

He tries to stop the car by releasing the accelerator, car slows to 1mph then shoots backward with driver not pressing pedal"
"I posted 3 separate links to posts with this same very specific problem with hold mode on an incline so definitely not super rare and also unlikely to be made up since it’s 3 different people claiming the same thing with other commenters also claiming it happened to them. So it’s either a real bug that happened or an organized effort to make up a very specific problem that then didn’t even get media attention or anything so what would be the point.

The brakes will of course always stop the car unless they’re seriously broken, that’s not really the point."
but the light at the end of the tunnel is.
"Lion Air, with hull wide."
"Yes, hold has many of the same failure modes as autopilot... which is discussed in the link. The mitigation is the brake pedal.

‘Shooting’ backwards is not one of those failure modes, as acceleration rate (even in reverse) is capped."
Ah but the hold bug was solved in the next patch after the update like a few days after the problem was reported. It never reoccurred if people got the update. It was only there for a short amount of time when they introduced the hold mode for the first time. All say exactly this : you put in reverse and accelerate but the car goes forward (or vice versa) because the computer was falsely interpreting the direction on these steep incline (due to a change of the driving model with hold mode only). Now it works fine. 😁
"If you think OP is lying then please say so instead of dancing around it. Basically my issue is that there were a few different reports of this happening around the same time with very similar accounts of the car suddenly speeding up instead of coming to a stop like it should, specifically when using Hold Mode on a steep driveway. So I’m inclined (no pun intended) to believe them."
"The point is that it happened at all...


This article claims that it can never happen ever."
Don't you get it? It never happened. What you are describing is not unintended acceleration. No amount of mental gymnastics you go through will change that fact.
"I'm not understanding it the same way. :-p The article spoke about claim of acceleration without touching the pedal, while in the hold mode bug, the pedal was pressed and correctly interpreted but the direction was wrong. In the article he spoke about different accidents where people claim that the car accelerate alone just before the accident happens (which is apparently unproven as all logs have apparently showed that the pedal was pressed by the driver). The author also said that it must be impossible to trick the car to make it think that the pedal is pressed when it is not. It shouldn't be possible in any car with all the failsafe for such important part. So if we follow this, it's conclusion that all these are due to people pressing the wrong pedal is a lot more probable (and it happens a lot). Of course this part can't be proven except if the data was public. 😁"
Guessing Tesla will want to refine the design some and LEGO and Tesla may want to to do a one time order through the Tesla shop.
This feels like something Elon would immediately approve on Twitter. Has anyone mentioned it yet?

I'd buy it.
"The first thing I said when I saw the Cybertruck is it looked like it was made out of legos. This seems kind of backwards, but definitely makes sense."
Tesla doesn't allow games to use their cars anymore. So I doubt there will be a Lego set.
This will probably be the first Lego car which looks super realistic and exactly like the real thing.

Building techniques that are prohibited by law and which consist of a felony punishable with up to 4 years in prison.

"It's punishable from the moment you put the bricks together in an illegal way, they just rarely catch people at first"

Sounds like a good time to start! Thanks for being a good sport.
Like in tournaments?
I thought about it. Though I do miss the good old days when the Legos back in the 90s looked pretty cool. Nowadays it just seems like all the pieces are built as one piece to make it really simple.
"Yes, or building in public in general, or hell, even at home, if you're dumb enough to post a photo of it where they can see it"
"That's sometimes the case, but more of an exception to the rule. Lego sets are more detailed and complex than they've ever been. Some of the more basic sets do reuse the same parts though. For instance, all the helicopters for the City line seem to use the same cockpit without exception. But if you want to build complex models, Lego is right now at the top of their game."
"IIRC, the Lego games (and movies) are top-notch, and there may now be a software version of a Lego set; so you can start building without actually buying them. It's the fastest, no cost, no cleanup, no pained foot when you step on it the next morning way to get back into it."
"Like, for real though, if I made an illegal model and posted a pic on social media and Lego finds it, I can go to prison? Like for real real?"
Damn I flexed my illegal build on IG earlier. FBI is on their way I bet.
"You are free to try it, but legally I have to say I do not endorse or condone this"
Is Lego like Disney or something?
"What it’s really about is 3D printed parts. If LEGO doesn’t press charges against people doing illegal builds, they essentially forfeit their right to prevent people from manufacturing illegal _parts_ at home, and then you could theoretically build an illegal Millennium Falcon, at which point yes, Disney gets involved by suing LEGO (because LEGO has deeper pockets than you), so yes, you could do jail time by publicly displaying your plastic bricks in configurations LEGO hasn’t approved."

2. Make sure it can do 250+ miles.

"To kill Tesla, you must first kill yourself."
"""Tesla killers"" are like all of the hitmen that work for the syndicate in the John Wich series. They may be out to kill John Wick, but it never seems to go thier way in the end."
I’m bout to leave this sub. Would be nice if you didn’t have to post validation posts every 5 minutes about how short other companies are
"Ok but did Mercedes say ""Tesla killer"" or did the news outlet that survives on clicks say that?"
"I’m all for more electric cars to compete with Tesla, it is what Elon wants after all, but if you’re gonna call yourself a Tesla killer you can at least not suck."
HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
"This just shows how comfortable everything must've been for those big car manufacturer that they're all struggling to keep up with a scammy, dying company run by a mentally unstable and unfit hack CEO. Hmmmm"
"This sucks for everyone. Tesla is leaps ahead, but we should support any efferts from manufacturers that are attempting an all electric vehicle. Competition is good, green is good"
"Listen guys, this isn’t good. The whole point of Tesla is to advance the rate of electric cars. Which means Tesla’s mission is to push all auto manufacturers to make electric vehicles sooner this is a big setback on a huge automaker."
Mercedes denies this report and says they plan to produce 50k in 2020.
"I'm always bummed about news articles like this. Yes, I'm ride or die Tesla, but their mission is to transition the world to sustainable energy. When other companies fail at making clean vehicles, that still hurts Tesla's bottom line. And the world."
"Downgraded to ""Tesla Annoyer"""
Hows the killing goin Mercedes?
Please somebody do a REAL competition with Tesla. I'd love to own an electric car (possibly a Tesla) but my budget isn't letting me. :(
"Lol, Tesla can’t be caught."
"they may not have cars to sell but they do have excuses... Tesla bought the battery factory robots? what else, they were just about to build a Berlin factory but Tesla bought the site?"
"These peeps drove 6 EV’s to death, Benz included. Benz died first

"Stop trying to kill Tesla, and start trying to save your companies from extinction, like the dinosaurs. Although, that would be a fitting fate."
"This reminds me of the first decade after World of Warcraft came out with all of the “WoW killers.”

What this type of thing ultimately does is just strengthen the brand they’re trying to defeat. 

Every once in awhile we get to see a company make a product that’s so good it transcends market competition.  As a car enthusiast (who drives a Honda), it’s been an absolute pleasure to watch Elon and Co. shit on everyone. 

I hope to continue to read stories like this for years to come. As customers, we all win in this scenario."
😬
"Imagine the sinking feeling when the MB executives realize they are planning to build 60k of a SUV that may only sell less than 10k because they decided to make it less appealing than their ICE SUV, but everybody is buying real Tesla EV SUV’s"
"In other news, the sun rose this morning and about 10 hours later, set."
They should give a call to “batteries are US”.  Elon knows battery.
"To reduce egg on face, I hereby coin the term Tesla Kille(r/d). The press release shall dream of /r while wake up call shall use /d."
"Honestly anything deemed Tesla Killer is just  circle jerk now. After the stock hit over 500 and the shorts bailed out, it's clear no one thing is gonna stop this locomotive.

All aboard the hype train!!!"
Oof
Didn't they rent out a Tesla to copy technology?
"Now a days, every EV car is a Tesla Killer and somehow they all fail to kill anything about Tesla."
We should have a Tesla killer anytime now.
Legacy auto makers can’t keep up

we need the dark souls of evs to kill tesla.
This remember me the Nokia before the end
Let’s stop with the Tesla “killer.”
"Missed opportunity for far better headlines. Things like ""How Elon Musk killed a Tesla killer""."
"The only Tesla killers are other Tesla's.
S killed OG roadster
3 is killing S
Y will kill X"
Did Daimler actually call it a Tesla killer? Or are we circle jerking for our own enjoyment here?
"""Competition is coming...""  
\*crickets\*  
""Ahem, I said, COMPETITION IS COMING....""  
\*crickets\*  
""Nevermind"""
"Hear me out, Tesla is t-posing in their logo to assert dominance and it's working as intended"
You hate to see it.
Someone is going to need some democracy soon.
"Tesla ""Killer"""
"One would expect Daimler stock price to crumble after this announcement, surely TSLA will be affected if they would do this...."
"Killer, word of the year"
"""Due to demand issues"""
"As a Q7 owner who hates ICEs I've been eyeing the etron, but I'll be getting a tesla just out of spite."
*laughs in Tesla*
And I remember there were big issues with the bms too?
Doesn't this scream anti-trust suit?
And as always this sub is 100% behind Tesla's mission statement...
"This is really bad news for the big auto companies. All the money and resources and they slept on it. Now they either accept defeat and license Tesla batteries, or start counting down the days of their existence. 

It's clear that there won't be a Tesla killer. But I do predict someone will license and purchase Tesla tech and batteries and compete against Tesla models with the ""Tesla under the hood"" approach. More options, same reliability, competitive pricing and Tesla making bank."
Everytime I see a car company brag about a “Tesla Killer” I laugh because I know half of them won’t come ever actually come out.
So Mercedes Telsa killer was killed by Tesla.
"Crazy when Tesla experiences difficulties it’s okay because they were new to building EV’s, but when a major car manufacturer starts to build an EV and it’s not as good or they experience difficulties as well they’re just trash, they eat out of troughs like pigs, they’re just the worst thing in the universe for also trying to advance the EV market."
Who could have known that you need batteries to produce evs... Oh right... Elon... Elon knew and built a huge factory because of it...
"FALSE.

The blog is referring to claim made by Manager Magazin. Which was debunked by Mercedes already.

Production goal for the EQC remains unchanged at 50.000.

Lol I wish I had money to buy tesla stock. At their core they're a battery company. They're 10 steps ahead. All the speculation and truckla and musk bs is irrelevant to the longevity of the company. Can they make batteries faster and better than anyone? Maybe not panasonic rn but that won't last.
paid for by ICE manufacturer is almost poetic
"I am going to make an EV better than Tesla.

How hard can it be?"
"I always think about [this](https://discourse-cloud-file-uploads.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/boingboing/original/3X/b/b/bb484265af7bed2dbd3c30f70216babbf1f450b7.jpg) when I think about how much legacy OEMs have under-estimated the challenge of making battery packs. ""Just throw some batteries in there."" Like it's just another gas tank and you can just fill it with cells."
Remember when the analysts said Tesla was “burying money in the desert”?
Why? Tesla is going bankwupt and EVs are dead.
I guess not trusting the yellow press might be an even smarter idea. Daimler has rejected this report as fiction.
The Tesla Killers have been acquitted of all charges.
Imagine that transitioning to EV production is more than just built a cool looking concept car.
"It's been 4 hours, I need a check in. Is Tesla still alive? The people need to know."
Kinda hard to kill something that is five years ahead of you.
"People thinks that this a good news for Tesla, it is not. 

How many vehicles does Tesla makes compared to ICE engines per year globally again? Less than 10 percent. People forget Tesla's main aim is not merely to be a profitable car maker, but to change the paradigm regarding energy source for vehicles. No matter how cool, lets face the facts, without major car makers being as successful as Tesla selling and pushing EVs massively, instead of ICE engines, we will be burning oil for a long long time. Tesla no matter what fans here say don't have the reach as they do. For instance, Tesla is simply unavailable where I am and if it does, 90 percent simply can't afford one.

Other car makers not producing Tesla killers is bad news for all EV fans, it means traditional car makers will continue to sell cheaper cost ICE cars instead of EVs."
Any time now...
Wait I haven't checked the stock since last night. Are you sure it hasn't gone down to 10 dollars a share like the Citi and GS analysts predicted?
"Same analysts that raise their Tesla price targets to $500 only after Tesla stock blows through $500. In other words, they’re 100% useless."
"> ""Tesla has no moat."" - Analysts I wouldn't trust to tell me which way is up.


The supercharger network is the moat."
Most are overrated.
"also in the conclusion of the article: Germany’s Auto Bild magazine on Thursday said the launch of the Mercedes EQC in North America has been postponed by a year, until 2021, because of the production problems."
"Even the Porsche Taken has a transmission hump that is ""built from the ground up to be an EV"".  My ass!"
"> All the ""killers"" do is help prop Tesla even more.

Literally:

> Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles struck a deal with Tesla to pool emissions figures that will require an estimated $2 billion payment to the electric car manufacturer. This amount will effectively pay for the initial construction of Tesla’s German Gigafactory 4 in Berlin.

Tesla built a moat, and Fiat-Chrysler paid for it..."
">  ""Hey we are bigger, better, smarter, been around longer, have tons of experience. But we can't keep up with an brand new company's innovations.""

It's impressive and maybe even under-appreciated that Tesla, which started from nothing, can compete and beat multi-national billion dollar corporations at their own game.

A real life David and Goliath story."
"*Elon picks up a pencil*

Daimler: oh nein"
Have you heard about the new iPhone killer?
"Mercedes never called any of their cars a ""Tesla Killer"" tho.

It's a term coined by blogs, youtubers and media."
"how bout ""the dark souls of electric cars?"""
Yeah. Remind me of all the other MMOs claiming to be the next World of Warcraft killer.
"Or calling something an Android killer.

Btw Android has like 87 percent market share so don't @ me."

"Breaking news: EV has batteries, will get back to you in a few years."
"People talk about playing 4D chess but imagine if Elon is fucking with the rest the of auto industry by making them believe that anyone,  ANYONE, can do EV car manufacturing as a part time gig like he is doing."
"Tesla’s survival depends on making it work. They have nothing else to fall back on. They have to push themselves to make progress.

ICE manufacturers sell plenty of their main product lines still. They’re dabbling in EV because they see the transition happening fast, but they’re still just learning to peddle a tricycle.

Tesla is taking the training wheels off their 2 wheeler, and about to get a big boy bike. Couple years from now they’ll have stunt pegs and ramps.

ICE will still be peddling in circles, wiping drool up with their bib."
bUT wHAt AbOUt fUeL cEllS?
They can‘t just switch to 100% EV production from one day to the next so having to be making both gasoline cars and quickly ramping up EV production means overhead costs increase significantly. For a company that has optimized its whole business for margins on a stable business model that‘s a very fine line to be balancing.
What are the odds that Tesla ends up being the battery supplier to all of these other auto manufacturers?
"For anyone else confused (Tesla didn't buy LG Chem, that would be big news): Mercedes had a contract with Grohmann Engineering to help them scale battery production, and then Tesla bought Grohmann."
This is speculation. Tesla bought them in 2016. Mercedes had plenty of times to find alternatives. There are dozen of company that specialize in industrial automation.
"No.  It's Mercedes own poor planning, not Tesla.  Nothing stopped Mercedes from negotiating exclusive contracts with Grohmann, or buying Grohmann themselves.  Cell supply is an obvious need, that's why Tesla had to build GF1."
"I got an advert in the mail trying to sell me on test driving an Audi e-tron. One of the selling points was that it could get 50 miles of range in just 10 minutes at a fast charger. I'm thinking to myself, ""Wow, and here I can only get 100 miles of range in 7 minutes at a v3 Supercharger with my Model 3.""

Maybe one of these days Audi can sell me on one their electric cars. But that day seems very far in the future, if ever."
"55 built with 60,000 projected. Bless their hearts."
:o
Lmao
They are going to have to order the skateboards from Tesla now. That would be a good move by mercedez.
"I become super bearish on a company when top managers say stuff like this, because a better answer is: 

“8 years ago when Tesla announced the model S and everyone in the industry said that electric was just a fad and would go away (including us) has hindered Mercedes - Benz ability to produce a sufficient number of batteries” 

Extreme Ownership Mercedes Benz.  Learn from it"
"Did you notice that Mercedes never claimed to make a ""Tesla-Killer""?


That term was coined by blogs like Teslarati and others but not a single manufacturer ever used it."
Masayoshi Son would like to know your location.
"Mine will go 0-60 in under a nanosecond.

Ok Bob Lutz
"The real tesla killer is a cool looking electric awd van with ample space and a small generator on board for unlimited range. No one would really want any other car after using/seeing one that can fit 8 people, fit in a normal parking spot, has 250 mi electricrange and unlimited gas. Plus the back seats could either rotate to face eachother or lay flat into a huge bed. Think about road trips with a self driving bed/ office."
"That's not news. That's just Tuesday. And Wednesday. And *Thursday*. And ...

(I live here, it's not really that bad. But it sure as fuck was in the 90s!)"
Me too. And I’m not a fan of Teslas’ interiors.
Chevy Bolt is pretty close to that and sells for under $30k.
"They can't do it profitably, and they don't even have decent software to go with it. They've already lost.

Only VW is serious about catching up."
Rivian seems like the only remote possibility
And only gets [194 miles on a charge...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7V2tU3iFc)
That's a bit far... I'm sure Mercedes will have a few assets left when they're liquidated as a result of their stubbornness to join the EV train!
"I've considered doing this, got them on my watchlist, but I am just uncertain about the company. 

I simply don't know anything about it or that sector."
"Tesla launched what would still be an extremelycompetitive car today back in 2012. It’s almost unbelievable but true. Years ahead of the competition, like the iPhone was."
"Mercedes CEO: ""We need a new CEO"""
"TSLAQ is that way....

Just kidding, join in the fun! Tesla has been scoffed at for years and countless ""analysts"" have said Tesla will never meet their promises, but they always broke through in the end."
"Not only that, but these rumors have already been denied. This thread reads like chat-room full of 12 year olds."
just filter out anything by teslarati ...
Asking the real questions.
"but they dont call themselves that. No serious manufacturer calls themselves ""xyz-competitor killer"""
Tesla roadkill
Literally every company does that...
"Yes, they also took it apart and then try to put it back together... Poorly."
Why spite?
We can simultaneously desire a world where electric propulsion is common while still enjoying the schadenfreude of a huge company half-heartedly claiming they are going to do Tesla better than Tesla does Tesla....only to realize that Tesla is pretty good at being Tesla because they have 100% committed to being Tesla
"Tesla has nothing to do with it. They sold 55 units.

Like, 55 cars, total."
"Every brand that calls itself ""x killer"" flops hard"
"It's kinda just a little bit of schadenfreude because if the broader automobile market 1) didn't shit on Tesla so much and if the media 2) didn't peddle out ""tesla killer"" articles every time a new competitor was in development or if legacy automaker 3) didn't act as if they could rest on their laurels of traditional carmaking and that success in ICE == success in EV making, perhaps people could be a tad bit more supportive.

Like give me a break, there literally is an article out right now titled ""Tesla Stock to $0."" Are you actually fucking kidding me ?  I have a hard time believing that these shorts and ""analyses"" are not loosely related to larger automakers and their advertising revenue."
"who knew that you need charger to charge a EV... and that's one of the main reason why Tesla is miles away from competition. Not only is a Tesla build as a EV from start, they also didn't forgot that a EV itself is useless."
ThE BiG BoYs aRe cOmMiNg!
"Yep. It's certainly been nice owning some the last 3-4 months. That's for sure. It may have leveled off for a while at this new price point, but I completely agree that the future looks VERY bright."
Is Tesla building their own batteries?  Isn’t Panasonic building the cells for Tesla at the Gigafactories?
Lol my dad bought some in April and now he gives me updates every single day because they are shooting through the roof :D
I heard news of them buying cobalt and lithium mining ops.
You do have money to buy some. Get a micro investment app like Stash or Robin Hood and buy what you can. Even if you only buy $20 worth it will grow. Set it to buy $10/week.
maxwell.
"There are a few brokerages that allow buying of fractional shares, so instead of having to spend the $500+ on a single share, you can spend say $250 on half of a share."
">At their core they're a battery company

I wish people would stop with this bullshit. Without the car there's no need for batteries and without the batteries there's no car. It's like saying they like Blockchain but not bitcoin. You don't get one without the other. Because there's no good examples of them being better apart."
"My favorite latest hit piece on the gigafactory was from USA today that accused Tesla of ruining Northern Nevada by helping revitilize the economy. Since this lead to higher housing prices and local government gets behind on paperwork (the horror!).


As a resident of northern nevada I am pretty happy with the better economy, personally speaking. Wages are up because Tesla and Panasonic are offering anyone with a pulse a job. If this is a problem I really don't want to see the solution."
[deleted]
"In the EV justice system the people are represented by two separate, yet equally important groups: Tesla owners with Sentry mode, and the criminals who appear in their recordings. These are their stories."
"The glove didn't fit. In fact, I'm not even sure there ever was a glove."
"> The Tesla Killers have been acquitted of all **BUT the** charges. 

Max range of 200M/charge."
Tesla status: alive
"> People thinks that this a good news for Tesla, it is not.

So you mean that it is bad for EV adoption in general? I agree with your point btw. Just don't see how it is bad for Tesla in particular."
"Toyota teams up with Tesla and now becomes a brand of Toyota. This is the best option if Toyota sees Tesla infrastructure doable world wide. Nissan has the Leaf but it’s not as good as a Model 3 range.


I mean Toyota has already teamed up with Subaru, Mazda, BMW to make some cars together so I don’t see how Tesla wouldn’t try a shot. An all electric Prius would be the best model to try the supercharger network. Maybe put a 24  hour access superchargers one at every Toyota dealer to increase their supercharger reach.

They have the Mirai Fuel Cell is a worse concept than any Tesla."
My first thought when reading the headline was that of disappointment.  I want a Tesla killer.  I want competition.  I would love to see the industry move forward.
"Hey, there are some very good non-Tesla EVs out there. The Kia Niro, the Kona, the Ioniq. Also battery manufacturing mostly happens in Asia (which is because long ago the Reagan administration effectively killed Lithium-Ion research and manufacturing in the US). The Germans missed the boat (more than the French with Renault being active in EVs already a long time). But they are a resilient people. They will find other ways to produce the cells."
I think now that tesla is past the point of potential immediate bankruptcy it could be good. Yes other makers not diving in hard enough will slow adoption but I think it’s inevitable and the longer that tesla has to completely own market is better for them long term.
Valid point
"> How many vehicles does Tesla makes compared to ICE engines per year globally again? Less than 10 percent.

Tesla produced 365k vehicles last year (despite Elon Musk having zero doubt they would be producing 10k per week by the end of 2018).  There were close to 80 million vehicle sales last year.  So yes, Tesla does represent less than 10%."
"While it means a much slower ramp up, it could mean that one day we are all driving Tesla vehicles if people don't get their heads out of the sand.

Looking at how inefficient some of the electric vehicles coming out have been (Porsche, definitely looking at you), lifetime emissions could be lower from more efficient vehicles on the road instead of botched electrics, depending on timing."
"They try to look like they are aware now of what is going on with Tesla. Then they tell people to sell the week before the Quarterly report.

It's madness."
"Wouldn't say they are 100% useless. Tesla is a special case and hard to predict and no one should be judged by their opinions on one stock. However, it is pretty ridiculous the sheer scale of people who predicted completely wrong about Tesla"
"I know an analyst who blew a lot of money investing in Russia right before they attacked Ukraine and all the Russian stock dropped and then he shit on tesla and was proud of how he shorted tesla at 170 and they instantly rose to 250.

Don't even wanna know how much money he lost that year or 2."
Elon said being an analyst is like trying to drive while looking thru the rear view.
"OTA updates, and battery tech are other “moats.”"
"No, they blamed it on increased demand in EU. They also claim production is sold out already for 2020. 

Now whether they're trying to cover for the fact that they are struggling w/production ramp, who knows."
The transmission is there to help with late-stage acceleration and top speed.  It's a valid choice for a performance car.
[deleted]
Porsche Taken. I like it. :)
"The drive shaft tunnel you're probably talking about is because they made cutouts in the battery for the rear passengers feet.  
That way you can actually comfortably sit in the rear of a taycan with longer legs. Something that's not really possible in a Tesla model S or 3. At least not for me."
I mean the transmission was there to make it feel like a normal car. I’m pretty sure it’s easier to not have a transmission but they did it anyways
Yup
especially given how competitive the Automotive sector is.
"*Elon sparpens pencil*

VW: heeeeeelp!!!!"
"It’s not like Daimler is a lot bigger then Tesla 
/s"
Does it fold?
"Wow, there's a phrase I completely forgot about until now. Those were (not) the days."
"""Ah shit guys, I just realized something, we need batteries."""
Short sellers got hooked
"This is one of the main points that gets missed.  The one company that actually has a decent shot at maybe becoming competition to Tesla in five to ten years is VW.  However, the only reason they fall into that lucky position is because their own stupid Dieselgate forced them into it.  VW more than any other legacy manufacturer \*needs\* EVs to survive.

Companies, like people, tend to stick to what they know.  Change is hard.  Anyone who has ever worked for or with a large company knows how fucking hard it is to get a company to change its culture in any significant way.  Entrenched interests are a thing.  

This is why I laugh any time an ""expert"" says that the decades of manufacturing experience is the thing that will let the big legacy companies take the lead.  The truth is exactly the opposite.  

If EVs really were just some relatively small adjustment, like adding power windows or throwing a catalytic converter into the mix, then the experts would have a point.  EVs, however, need to be built using a completely new design, a new mindset, hell, a new paradigm.  This is exactly the place where big lumbering companies fail.  

By the standards of the ""experts"", Sears should have seen off Amazon easily.  I mean, a big company doing sales through catalogues for over a century?  Come on!  They had the money, the market, the people, the experience.  But somehow, Sears is bankrupt and the owner of Amazon is competing with SpaceX to see who has the biggest dick in space.  

Looking back, it's obvious why Sears never had a shot.  All that experience and power in an older world not only did not help them, but was a major reason why Sears (and all the rest) couldn't adjust in time.  Their battleship was trying to have a maneuverability contest with gunboats, and that is a contest that only goes one way, every time.

I have some sympathy for the analysts who got Amazon wrong.  The Internet was the first real paradigm shift in a few generations.  I have a lot less sympathy for them getting it wrong with EVs.  The lessons learned should still be fresh in their minds, but they seem almost willfully ignorant.  This level of stupidity is the core reason why many people look at this and think: conspiracy.  I don't know if I agree with that 100%.  Stupid people are gonna be stupid.  But Hanlon's maxim, ""Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity,"" is sorely tested by these ""experts"".

One sad sidenote: the shorts are missing out on a true gold mine.  Many of the legacy ICEs are going to die.  Holding a long term short position in those companies is almost guaranteed to reap huge benefits eventually.  Just choose any company that does not have an absolute solid business plan to completely convert to EVs.  They're kinda spoiled for choice right now.

So this post turned out longer than I was expecting.  I agree completely with your position, and it's going to be fun watching this sector for the next decade."
"I really hope that Ford will do well. Putting their Mustang brand out there like that shows commitment. I also like how they haven’t been teasing it for 10 years, but just took their time and made something that looks really thought through."
"Yup.  

When Tesla develops the model Y they can share 70% of the parts with the Model 3 and it just makes sense.

On the other hand, when an ICE manufacturer develops their first EV and shares 70% of the parts with a compact sedan, it doesn't turn out so well..."

Why did Tesla buy them? Just to mess with Mercedes? Lol
Way to assert dominance
Sounds like Mercedes wasn't all in.
That was like 2 years ago? And they just noticed?
"Mercedes: makes a contract with Grohmann Engineering to help scale battery production.
Tesla: I'm gonna do what's called a pro gamer move."
I'm very sure that producing battery modules is not the bottleneck for Mercedes. It's the cells that are the problem and that has nothing to do with Grohmann.
"This sounds like the guy who was responsible for this was also the guy who keeps track of their domain names.  He got overwhelmed, one got through the cracks."
"Pfft. They bumbled it. 

Dr Z. sold that stake in Tesla in 2014 and quipped about being the only company to every make a profit with EV.

Everybody thought they could ride it out with Euro6 diesels."
"The big car companies had exclusive contracts with grohmann which is exactly why people at grohmann were not happy when tesla bought them and canceled all contracts.
Decades of trust and cooperation canceled in an instant so whenever tesla doesnt need grohmann anymore they will go bankrupt instantly because there are no other customers that would order from them anymore."
absolutely nothing stopped all these manufacturers from investing in ev early but they'd rather pay marketing firms to make tesla fail than try to win themselves.
"Problem for them is Tesla does not seem to be slowing down any time soon. Maybe they can get to where Tesla is today in 3 years, but in 3 years Tesla will be even farther ahead."
"And that advert shows exactly why the traditional automakers have such a hard time with this.  Instead of selling people on the instant and responsive torque, the convenience of never having to stop by a smelly gas station, or the convenience of no scheduled maintenance, they highlight something that they thought they had a competitive advantage against Tesla on.

The sooner they're willing to sink their own ICE business, the greater their chance of surviving."
"The e-tron is a nice EV before or right when the first Model S came out.  It has no regen braking, the voice recognition deserves a fist through the navigation screen and the acceleration is stuck in comfort mode.  


They do come in nice colors though.  I am partial to the blue."
"TBF, the eTron can keep that speed pretty long into the charging cycle.

AFAIK the eTron isn't that bad as a long-distance vehicle due to its charging speed. But nevertheless, it's far less efficient than a Tesla and once people need to pay realistic prices for electricity, that will show. Because the trip might be equal in time used, it will be more expensive."
And for more money!
wE'LL dO OTA uPDatEs REal sOoN nOW!
"You can't really compare the model 3 and the e-tron though, as the e-tron is much thirstier. E-tron charges much faster than model x for example.

And most importantly, what you failed to account for was the excellent charging curve of the e-tron. The model 3 and even more so the s/x get very slow at the top SOC. E-tron holds over 100kw for a long time."
Instant collectible.  The Mercedes SLR McLaren had 500 units built.
oh wtf. i thought you mean 55k at first. how can they only make 55?
"Awwww... fluffly liddle cuddle kins.

Ruh oh, that's a nice sounddddding buuuuuurp Mercedes!"
Gotta milk that 2020 credit.
How hard is it to make enough batteries for 55 cars ;)
"I believe they planned 25,000 but only managed to build 7,000. Of those, they sold only 55 in Germany. 

To me that is far worse. Not only could they not build the number they wanted; they couldn’t sell the ones they built."
"…**Mercedes S-Class**, *powered by Tesla*."
Honestly I would not mind if all the other automakers went bankrupt and the workforce all transitioned to Tesla
We just upped the specs. 0-90 in a nano-NANO-second.
More like *turns to nuclear fusion explosion*. That'd be 2.7 **billion Gs**.
"Didn't think of all that. Well we just upgraded our plans. Now our Tesla Killer will run on air, fits 12 people, looks bitchin', compact, sleeps 8, has a 12,000 mile range and floats through the air. It will even make you sammiches."
I think you misread my post... :)
"The Bolt isn't a bad car, it's battery/range/features are okay for someone that wants a basic electric car.   I'd love to go 100% EV myself. (Currently in a Gen2 Volt) 

My problem is the Bolt is just ugly with a extremely meh interior. Compounding the problem is that GM and almost every dealership doesn't really want to sell them that hard.  Sure you can buy one but the process might not be as smooth or fun, and finding a good dealer that services them properly is another hurdle. 

There was a fan/artist website for a car called the Chevy Jolt - and quite frankly it looked amazing (even though it's not at all real), basically a Bolt drivetrain/battery system in a sexy/tight package.  The site is still up: https://www.chevyjoltev.com/   but if GM came out with that, I'd give it a serious look."
"The Chevy Bolt is not bad. I think the problem is, GM doesn't really want to sell electric cars. They make so much profit on ICE vehicles. so they don't want people to buy a Bolt instead of one of their SUVs."
"I put Rivian with the others. The only thing going for it is amazon’s deep pockets. At the end of the day if you dont have the battery, software and super charger network youre poop."
"Compare RivIan's stats to the Cybertruck (less top range, towing capacity, seating, storage, no self driving, no massive charging networks) and then compare their prices.

Unless the Cybertruck shows up with a 50% price increase at launch day, the Rivian is DOA."
"if rivian doesnt end up a small production or vaporware, it would be shocking. there's a reason why when tesla started, there hadnt been a new american car company since chrysler."
Jesus. I was looking for range on the website. No wonder they didn’t advertise that. What a terrible vehicle in comparison to Model 3 or Model S. Best you could say is it maybe has nicer interior trim level.
"Yeah, cause I would lean towards the news site especially since having the word ""Tesla"" in your title is instant SEO"

The point is Tesla fans always claim to be for more EVs yet this is this only sub going crazy about negative news like this.
"Then be mad at the articles and magazines, not at the manufacturers finally stop acting like boomers and partake in the future car market. And for 3, you’re mad at car manufacturers having a history of success and applying their reputation and knowledge into making EV’s? I’m really confused. But yeah I agree car articles are shit 99% of the time. They once convinced me to test drive a Focus RS, and it was shit, never again."

They acquired Maxwell and are in the process of vertically integrating the new battery tech. Should make their batteries cheaper and quicker to produce.
"They make their own batteries, but Panasonic do the cells."
Yes.  Tesla builds batteries.  Panasonic makes the cells Tesla uses to build batteries.  It's like asking if GM builds cars because Delco and Bosch build the parts.
"I bought some when it was at 198, so I smile and brag about that whenever people see me checking the chart. The truth is though that I pick and choose what to mention, and we hear more about the big wins. I bought at a few different price points.. including at 370 during the ""funding secured"" spike before it nosedived. I much preferred not to talk about that one until it recently surpassed that mark.. and in the greater scheme, I mostly haven't been investing money at all and I'd have been far, far better off if I had simply put everything in an index fund (as would the great majority of portfolio managers!)"

IIRC Elon said they would not be using Cobalt in their future batteries.

"You joke, but there’s something to it. I still think there are issues with Teslas interior design (cheap-looking materials) and general production quality issues(clearances, paint imperfections, etc.), but I do agree that those things most likely won’t matter in the big picture. Tesla’s biggest moat is the supercharger network / how much the other car companies (especially in Germany) a f...ing up their charging infrastructure. It doesn’t matter how nice the car looks, if something as simple as charging it on the road is a terrible experience.
Bottom line: I’m really looking forward to Teslas Made in Germany."

"The E-Tron outsold the Model X in Europe by well over 2 to 1 last year (~19,500 to ~9,000).    In the US the Model X sold ~19,225 while the E-Tron only managed 5,369, but E-Tron sales didn't start there until April.  

The E-Tron is currently the top selling EV in Norway so far this year (https://elbilstatistikk.no/?sort=3), with 429 sales in under 24 days.  The Model X sold 214 in Norway in all of Q4.

It will be interesting to see how the ID3 and ID4 compete with the Model 3 and Model Y in Europe."
"Sure, but my point is that Tesla fanbois here cheered the fact Tesla's competitors failing to make Tesla killers is a good thing. No. It is a bad thing. Tesla is not competing against other EVs from other companies. Tesla is actually competing against ICE cars as the most sensible choice as a personal vehicle for the masses. If other companies fail to produce Tesla killers, that means they are still focusing on ICE cars instead of creating great EVs and solving the battery issues themselves."

They can do this with different gearing on the front and rear motors ... even different gearing left to right wheel would work if you want to go cheap.
What he means is the driveshaft tunnel in the middle of the rear passenger floor. Which obviously should be unnecessary in an EV where there is no driveshaft connecting the front and rear.

"> Looking back, it's obvious why Sears never had a shot. All that experience and power in an older world not only did not help them, but was a major reason why Sears (and all the rest) couldn't adjust in time.

I have mixed feelings on that.  The problem was the cozy management really.  On the one hand I can see how cozy management is almost always inevitable in such a company.  However, if they HAD brought in a real disrupter as CEO back in the 90s it could have turned out very differently.  

Sure, Sears had zero experience in the e-commerce space itself, so they would have had to bring in the people to design the storefronts and all that.  However, when it comes to the distribution and logistics side of a mail-order business, and all the back-office stuff like handling sales taxes for a bazillion different zip codes, and handling in-store returns of mail-order items, that is something Sears was about as good as it got back in that era.  Really Sears wasn't much worse at that stuff in the 90s than Amazon is at it today, setting aside some of their most recent improvements with automation and their own delivery network.

Getting back to Tesla, there is a flip side to all of this.  When a disrupter takes over an industry it is easy to look back and see how it was obvious that the time was right and all that.  However, the reality is that disrupters pop up all the time, and 99% of the time they fail.  For the start-up it is a moonshot and so they're all-in, and it makes sense to just focus on high-risk-high-reward.  When they fail the investors lose everything most of the time, and when they succeed they win big.  That's just their entire business model.

It makes a lot less sense for a conventional company to take that approach.  When a company like Tesla comes along it is like a 1-in-100 bet.  If you take such a bet 100 times, you're going to lose 99 of those times.  Any established company that regularly makes these sorts of bets is going to be unsuccessful, unless they can do it in a way that greatly contains the damage.  They're never going to be all-in, and the CEO can't keep up with a bazillion little experiments like these.  

We talk about Tesla because it was the success story.  We don't talk about Apple of the 80s, or a million fly-by-nights that had a crazy idea that ended up being crazy.

Ultimately though the market works it out.  The legacy companies end up being, well, legacy.  The failed ideas fail.  The successful disrupters dominate the market.  The place where it gets hard, IMO, is the employees who end up having to change jobs because that is something that, again IMO, our society isn't very good at handling.  The bright car designer in Detroit can't go work for Tesla unless he is willing to move his family halfway across the country to a very different area.  If that designer is a bit older it is even harder to make a change like this.  This is also why the market is slower to adapt - there is a lot of inertia in the expertise moving around, which keeps obsolete companies around longer/etc."
"> Just choose any company that does not have an absolute solid business plan to completely convert to EVs.

"I’m actually surprised they didn’t do their truck in mass production first, but I guess they’re afraid of hurting their ICE F150 sales while not being able to produce enough EV models?

"Not exactly. Grohmann is a well-known company in production and automation that produces a great deal of many factory robots for German automakers- not just Daimler, but also VW and BMW as well. Tesla likely bought them because vertical integration and Elon's dreams of an alien dreadnought factory. And I suspect Tesla also wanted priority over every other customer as it tried ramping up the Model 3.

Tesla doesn't just want to dominate the car industry, but also the car factory industry."
"The question isn’t why did Tesla buy them, the question is why DIDN’T Mercedes buy them?"
just the tip
"> Decades of trust and cooperation canceled in an instant so whenever tesla does need grohmann anymore they will go bankrupt instantly because there are no other customers that would order from them anymore.

Depending on those contracts I'm surprised there aren't lawsuits.  If the contracts didn't have some kind of penalty for non-performance then that is on the companies relying on them.

That said, at this point they're an acquired company.  Tesla has no reason to just flush them down the toilet - that is a waste of money.  Chances are they're going to just slowly get absorbed into the rest of the company and eventually you won't really know where the one starts and the other ends.  

However, if for some reason Tesla did decide to spin them off I don't see other companies just shunning them.  If they weren't connected to Tesla any longer then there is no reason to spite a faceless corporation.  

Really the idea of ""trust and cooperation"" with a corporation isn't something most big companies believe in.  You can trust and cooperate with people, but people change jobs all the time.  You can have a contract with a corporation, and that is just dollars and cents.  A completely ""trustworthy"" corporation can change overnight if they change CEOs or owners, as this one did.  Likewise, a completely terrible one can become reputable fairly quickly if they make a large change.  

I get that brand loyalty is still a thing, especially with individuals.  However, investors and businesses would be wise to question this, as there is a lot of money to be made by spotting those brands that the market is undervaluing, or overvaluing.  That includes the poorly run business that suddenly is taken over by a sharp set of owners/etc."
"Are they even where Tesla was 7 years ago. 3 years behind Tesla whould be Herculean effort, don't bet on it."

"> The sooner they're willing to sink their own ICE business, the greater their chance of surviving.

 I agree.

 We all like to make fun of things like the Ipace and Etron here, but compared to ICE cars, they are *amazing*. From what I've heard, they have very high customer satisfaction. And yet I have yet to see an advertisement for either comparing them to ICE cars. Jaguar ads that have comparisons compare it to the Tesla Model X. 

Really? Trying to steal sales from people thinking of buying an X? Talk about a small audience. And that's a tough sell, since the X has loads of things the Ipace is missing, like the supercharger network. 

Returning to your point, if Jaguar would compare the Ipace to ICE vehicles, it would look insanely good. But they don't. Huge fail in my mind."

**TL;DR:** Audi E-tron is always below Tesla Model 3 charging curve (and will never catch up). The Model 3 has nearly *twice* the efficiency:

1. [490 Wh/mi = Porsche Taycan](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=42383);
2. [460 Wh/mi = **Audi E-tron**](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=41393);

"> At the end of the day if you dont have the...super charger network youre poop.

This is what did it for me on Rivian shortly after the CT came out. Right after the release there was an infographic comparing both trucks with all sorts of different specs. When I got down to charging it said Rivian: 120kw/Cybertruck: 250+kw.

That's an astonishing difference. 120 kw is plenty for a Model 3, but the battery in a Rivian is going to be HUGE. If there's one thing larger EVs like the CT, Atlis, Rivian, Bollinger, etc all need, it's fast L3 charging."
"The Rivian does have one thing going for it-being first. Atlis, Bollinger, Cybertruck, Ford-they're all 2 years away plus. Rivian is coming out *this year*. So just by that virtue alone they can't be DOA.

That being said, Rivian is going to have some STIFF competition after their first year of sales."

There are legitimate numbers that suggest that the stock is overpriced right now, but those numbers are based on methods for evaluating standard (old) car companies - that just means that there's more downwards pressure on the stock. I still agree with Ark Invest's overall analysis and believe it's going to 10x (or more) from the current numbers... but that it's a long term play to prove that it's the best EV company, not a short term one."

"They bought them, so kind of absorbed already."
"I think it's more than just the charger network.  The constant upgrades and software is really the other huge advantage.  It's rare for other automakers to ever upgrade their software.  They frankly never make over the air improvements or fix model year production runs.  Until other manufacturers catch up on the software side of things, Tesla will have a huge advantage despite their fit and finish problems."
This.  This cannot be understated...  All the people saying that others will build the infrastructure can now cry in their beers over the obnoxious price increases to the charging usage...
Made in Germany won't change anything if the engineers don't get the process right. And manual QC will be even more expensive.

"Uh, no. There’s a reason Teslas aren’t that fast in the top end, they gear out. That’s why a P3D will outlaunch a 500hp sports car, but will get overtaken by the sports car from a roll/in the top end."
"Tesla has a transmission as it needs to go forward and reverse. It's a simple one, but it exists. 
They used to have 2 speeds before in their first transmission."
"That really is the advantage of a start-up that vertically integrates.  It is baked into their DNA that if they want something, they have to invent it.

Established industries always spawn a network of 3rd party suppliers so that anytime you design anything you have the option of building or buying.  That is true even for the core areas where you're really good.  I believe Honda has a strong reputation for their engines which get used in all sorts of products, but if they had a shortage in pistons for some strange reason I bet they could probably just order up a ton of them from any number of companies.  Sure, it would cost them more, but it gives them options.

I know at work anytime we create any process we're confronted with the option of internal or external sourcing.  The pros and cons and costs get weighed and we use the right solutions in the right place.  Even when we're outsourcing we usually have enough internal expertise that we can get a good price and stay on top of supplier performance.  

It is pretty easy for a conventional company to just take that for granted.  The result is car companies who can't get enough batteries for their EVs, or cell phone companies who can't get firmware updates for their embedded processors, and so on.  By making almost everything themselves Tesla can handle anything.  If they find a problem in an 8 year old electronics component, they have a design team that could update the component, do a software update, or elect to replace it with a newer part.  A conventional manufacturer would probably just have to buy newer parts and do a recall, and perhaps be stuck trying to fit square pegs into round holes while they're at it."
"I'll have to look into them, but unless they are literally ripping out their old manufacturing and replacing it wholesale with EVs developed from the ground up, I don't see them being able to make the change in time.  

My current guess is that two, maybe three, of the current big players are going to make it.  Tesla can't control the whole market, after all.  The rest of the big players will either die out completely or be bought out."
"I wouldn't really disagree with much of that.  The only thing that I would point out is that none of this explains why the ""experts"" were still holding on to the narrative once Tesla was ramping up.  Sure, there were problems; there are always problems.  The numbers, however, told a fairly simple and compelling story: Tesla was (and is) growing like crazy.  

The idea that Tesla might be just crazy is ok before the Roadster.  I would even say that it was still a bit understandable before the Model 3.  Once that came out, though, everyone should have realized that this was a real disrupter and not just a flash in the pan.

I agree completely that entrenched companies are heavily incentivized not to take larger risks.  That's fine as long as there is only incremental changes in the industry, but that is also why even the big and mighty companies die when the industry does undergo major changes.  This is absolutely a natural part of being a big company.  

What I don't get is how we \*just\* went through a whole slew of big companies dying out for this very reason, and yet the ""experts"" in the auto industry somehow think that the big auto companies are immune.  Absolutely amazing."
The truck just isn’t ready yet. There’s a reason Tesla waited this long too. $/kWh had to come down first.
are you juiced? I said power move!
"And the power storage industry, and the commercial solar power generation industry"
I wonder how much Grohmann helped the 3 reach reasonable production speed.
Just to clarify (I think) but grohmann doesn’t produce any robots. They just design and build the automated production line integrating various robotics and equipment from others.
"They bought them in 2016, how is this an issue now?"

"Probably the same reason Mercedes doesn't own it's seat manufacturer, or it's ECU manufacturer - no desire to vertically integrate. The old companies build petrol/diesel engines, and once those our out, they'll essentially just be assemblers of LG or others' products."
Also equally interesting. I‘m guessing Mercedes/others don’t want to handle this side of the business and would rather have a 3rd party deal with it.
Ohh I fucking am!  Go drive one and feel your heart sink into your chest in fear as it will not slow when you take your foot off the gas.
Isn’t it the same story with the Taycan? They act like “coasting” is a big selling point while further crippling its range.
"Tesla owners ... Taycan (and all other EV) have regen braking and it is a far better implementation than what Tesla has because it is activated primarily by using the brake pedal. Press one pedal to go fast, other to go slower, don't worry about regen - car does that automatically. This allows these cars to provide FAR MORE regen capability as you can allow regent to slow the car dramatically faster when the driver has requested this via brake pedal application instead of just slamming the ""brakes"" just because the driver lifted their foot from the accelerator."
[It's total bullshit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glopb8tS2mI)
"Don't know man.  Go test drive one, its a fucking horrible feeling when it just keeps coasting."
"He's full of shit. The etron has regen fairly strong one even. Same for the taycan. Taycan up to 265kw. E-tron up to 220kw. 

 https://electrek.co/2018/08/08/audi-e-tron-quattro-electric-suv-range-regen-braking/

"Ok. I prefer efficiency over speed anyway. 

No 250kW chargers in Europe though. 

Model Y vs VW ID.Crozz will be the real litmus test. 

It’s a shame that our manufacturers couldn’t get off their asses in time and now look like they are being leapfrogged. 

I really wanted to buy a Mercedes, but the EQC delivers a bit too little for what amounts to about 20k CHF over the most expensive Model Y."
Sedan is more efficient than a luxury suv. In other news water is wet.
We'll have it done in 1.989 years. That's how good it's going to be.
yea but they cant scale up their production enough in that time anyway. so it really doesnt matter. it's not like they're gonna scoop up a large portion of truck buyers. i would guess it will take rivian at least 5 years to reach model s production numbers and that's a generous estimate.
"I'm struggling to understand your argument. Either way, I'll get an electrical car next, and while the e-tron is fairly nice, I'll go with Tesla for several reasons."
"Well I’m not the one who’s mad, it’s you. If a manufacturer makes a shitty car then oh well, it’s not a big deal. When the new Supra came out I was super interested in it, but it’s not a good deal and not very fast but oh well I’ll just buy another vehicle. I’m not gonna throw a fit just because a manufacturer made a bad car, I could care less because there’s other vehicles."
Elon:  How about I sell you some carbon credits instead?
">  Is there a better time to buy (possibly, ovbi no way to know for sure) in the near future?

Delivery count was very good in Q4, but the mix is certainly high on Model 3 and low on S/X varieties.  This will pull down profitability per vehicle.  And, we had big expenditures in Q4 related to Gigafactory 3 going online (but not getting output) and other investments like into the model Y.  So, it is very possible that while revenue shines, the profit numbers are negative in Q4 results released next week.  if so, stock will drop before coming back up to these levels again.  The only long term issue there is the S/X mix being so low, but this should be outweighed by pure volume and reducing the relative amount of investment in Q1 versus new revenue streams coming live."
"Anyone that says they know the answer is full of it, and wants something from you. Having said that, I personally believe that buying after a big run like this isn't a great idea. Generally there's a ""correction"" back towards the starting numbers from a month ago. But of course we don't know - this could be the correction, or it could just keep going."
"No, Tesla wants some Maxwell tech for solid state battery. Having supercaps in car with large low impedance battery doesn't make any sense."
Nope. That recent podcast interview has Elon firmly saying supercaps are not necessary.
"Yeah. I can totally understand why he's doing it though. For anyone who has been owning Tesla stock and tracking the news and its ups and downs.. we keep really expecting a hit job to blow up in the media and for the stock to tank, as it always has. This time though, it keeps shooting up and up and each time, it feels surprising and like new news again."
how much did he invest?
But that’s a thing that mainly appeals to us more tech-savvy users. I’d argue the majority of car owners prefer their car to stay the way it is and don’t want surprises.
"It's a moat, not an impentrable fortress. If I'm not mistaken BP is busily rolling out significant  amounts of infrastructure here in England under the Polar brand ditto Shell. The oil companies have land, deep pockets and a desire to reduce risk."
Or your close minded Tesla fanboys could gave read a bit further than Teslatrek and would know that with the various charging subscriptions from the manufacturers the prices didn't change.
I’d say that depends a bit on the “user profile”. I’d certainly wouldn’t want more fragile materials if I’d have two toddlers and a Model X. On the other hand your typical Model S customer might expect a bit more.

"Tesla will not be able to grow exponentially. That is a fact. If they are able, they would've made profit a long time ago. They may be a cult favourite where they are available, but a mass market car the are not for the forseeable future, simply because the cheapest Tesla is still far more expensive than the cheapest ICE car."
Notice the smiley on the end? I'm making a jokey joke.
Source?
"No it won't. Rimac C2 will, but the Tesla specifically said it won't and there's no reason for it to unless it's aiming for land speed records or something"
"Such is life, I guess"
"well, not really, transmissions are usually comprised of multiple, switchable, drive ratios. the diff is a fixed drive ratio. 

i guess it depends on the strict definition of *transmission*."
"That's the right way to pronounce it, according to [this YouTube video on the Porsche channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8oixMu703s)."
Did I say Porsche bought the rights?  Yes
I think they included a gear box because thats what cars have and they build cars.
"There might be a reason why they don't do this but the front wheels could have drastically different gearing from the rears.  When the rears wheels ""gear out"" (I love this term, thanks!) the fronts could keep going to 200-250mph.  
Koenigsegg  does something similar to this but puts the higher gears on the rear wheel.  


 [https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-shows/geneva-auto-show/news/a25167/koenigsegg-regera-hypercar-first-look-details/](https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-shows/geneva-auto-show/news/a25167/koenigsegg-regera-hypercar-first-look-details/)"
"There is reverse ""gear"" in a Tesla.  They change the polarity of the electrons flowing to the motor to have it spin backwards."
"Yeah, it stopped being a complete moonshot after the Model S was going for a few years.  Even the Model 3 was still a risky time as that was when the concept was really having to make it to market.

Once Munro/etc started raving about the car it stopped being much of a risk.  At least, not the company.  The stock was maybe still a little at risk until they started showing some returns - if it had big cash flow issues that could have been a risk for the stock, but not really for the company.  At that point the company itself had enough value that it wasn't just going to go away."
Ohmy bad.
"And the space industry, and the solar home industry, and the wireless internet industry ..."
A fuck ton.

"They bought a manufacturing tooling company from Minnesota (Perbix), so Grohmann and Perbix probably worked very closely."
"It's not.

That said, when Tesla bought Grohmann, they had existing contracts with other automakers and supposedly weren't delivering those on time, which was rumored to be the reason for Klaus Grohmann's early departure from the company."
"I mean, my boss often asks me to do things that I might not prefer to do.  Then I look at my paycheck, and decide that there is a reason I go to work every day instead of doing something else.

It isn't that I am not doing something I like at some level.  It is just that if I didn't care about getting paid I'm sure I'd be doing something I like even more."

"The Taycan has incredible regen, up to 256kw. It puts the model 3's measly 76kw to shame."
"The Taycan has *optional* regen, and it's off by default. That's one of the reasons it got such an abysmal EPA range: they don't let you change the default settings for the test. It also happens to be especially inefficient at the speed the EPA tests, which is just below the speed at which the car shifts into 2nd gear."
Coasting is the most efficient way. EVERY engery transformation has losses.
"Ummm, I don't think you know how regen works in most/all EVs. Its on a very low mode when 'coasting', to simulate the resistance that traditional ICE's have. It's on a higher mode when braking. The car doesn't slam on the regen when you lift your foot off the gas, unless you specifically set it to use one-pedal mode. Regen isn't a 0% or 100% thing in any EV, the amount can vary based on how quickly the driver wants to slow down.

And, Porsche actually has a rather bad implementation of regen because they wanted it to feel as much like traditional brakes as possible, and they focused on that rather than regen efficiency. It's why the Porsche gets fewer miles per kwh than a similar Model S."
"I think the first major manufacturer that gets over themselves and just licenses Tesla tech (battery, autopilot, superchargers, etc.) will crush the competition along with Tesla. Not sure it will ever happen, but one can hope. It may be too late at this point.

Edit: The beauty of this is that consumers get to stay with the brands they love and still get all of the best tech without waiting years for them to catch up. Tesla benefits from the licensing revenue and non-Tesla brands can focus on the aspects of their cars that their customers love. The environment wins as well."
">No 250kW chargers in Europe though.

There's one 250kW Supercharger in London, but you make a good point that they're rolling out slowly so far, especially outside the US.

Also aren't there multiple 350kW non-Tesla chargers?"
They have some great backing... let’s hope they can pull it off. We need more cars and trucks in the ev game.. we need a Camry killer.
"They are partnered with Ford - so aside from the battery, I am not sure what risk you think they have of being able to scale. They also have a much more 'traditional' design than the Model X or the Cybertruck, which shouldn't be discounted. And the Amazon investment shouldn't be ignored, because if they're able to create a commercial delivery van product, that's a great market to be in.

I don't know that Rivian will ever create a sedan, so it's not a true 'killer' - but I think it's probably the closest."
"I was trying to figure out the spite part of your comment a few above.  Seems like your decision is more logical than spite based.  Anyways, hope it works well for you"
Great.
This is a GREAT summary.
"There was a decent YouTube video that explained some of Maxwell’s tech wrt Tesla et all 

https://youtu.be/XMOFuEH0BZI"
"I really am excited about the new battery tech i expect from tesla in the next few years, hopefully not more than 3 years. 

]I wish Elon would make some huge announcement about solid state battery and how far research has come and how viable it is and when it can be expected in cars."
Don’t know exactly. Not good with remembering numbers.
"> ""Damnit, I don't like surprises! How do I turn off this 5% power boost that they gave me without warning??"""
"Maybe.  I own an Audi too.  The tech in the Tesla is far, far and away better.  The lack of a key, the app functions, autopilot, infotainment and the launch are just amazing in Tesla.  However, the fit/finish, customer service, and drive quality in the Audi is better.  That said, I had the option to buy another Audi and I bought a Model 3 instead.   I just wish I could merge some of the features of both though."
"While I welcome competition, they’re still not quite getting it. With a supercharger you just roll up and plug in. Tesla charges your credit card if you don’t have free supercharging. Audi charges you $20 every month for a charging service, and if you take your e-tron to Ionity the price pr. kWh is still almost twice as high as Teslas. 

My parents call me every time they need to charge their Leaf because they do it so rarely that they forget how, and then it’s not the same charger as the last time and it’s slightly different, or they can’t figure out where to hold the RFID-tag. Sure, most EV owners - today - are more woke than my parents, but if we are to get everyone over these are the ones we have to design solutions for."
"Exactly. While car companies are going to need to push for charging infrastructure I think we'll see energy companies being the ones building the infrastructure in the future.

This is where Tesla is a little different as it is/will be an energy company as well."
Kind of irrelevant when the price of the vehicle raises significantly to cover the cost of building a charging infrastructure.
"I just feel many associate plastic-looking with ""easily-breakable"", but that's only because of experience and association. The new LG gram laptop looks a bit like plastic for example, but is a carbon-magnesium alloy and is lightweight, strong and durable. I'd have that any day over a material that looks more superficially 'premium' but easily scratches or scuffs."
"hjönk hjönk

r/untitledgoosegame"
"Batteries will get cheaper and cheaper with more and more energy. If other companies can do it and make a profit, then so can Tesla, but cheaper and better."
I think it's easier and more fruitful to build a single bigger more powerful motor than to start messing around with multiple gears.
"So I looked it up— apparently there are dishes in the battery for extra foot clearance in the floor pan for feet. So the rear passengers can sit low and have that sloping roofline.

So it appears to be a driveshaft tunnel but it’s batteries — I supposed that would be why downvotes."
The right way to write it if it's how you pronounce it would be gay khan. Since it's a German car tie con would be very different from how you pronounce it.
Not really sure what you mean.
"There is still transmission, the motor is not connected directly to the wheels, you need to reduce the rotational speed. It's very simple, but it's a transmission."

">> **Tesla** doesn't just want to dominate the car industry, but also the car factory industry.

You must be confusing Tesla with Elon Musk."
"If it has electricity, Tesla wants it."
And the very boring tunnel industry.
He did the math
"The exact opposite, actually. Tesla failed to automate battery pack assembly and ended up doing it by hand until the Grohmann line could be built and installed."
"it only makes sense if you have a ceo that created a culture of engineering excellence and innovation. if your engineers are the best, then you can make a product that beats even the best companies out there. otherwise you have to outsource."
"Good god, 256kw of regen would snap your neck!"
No they meant the regen is a separate action and not tied to the Go pedal
"So in reality and unbiased, how does a Taycan stack up against a Tesla P100D for range?"
Coasting into the car in front of you seems quite efficient.
Yeah right. Converting kinetic energy to heat in your brakes is more efficient.
You’re not wrong but in every day use you’ll see more overall range from regen which is what I’m getting at. I live near the mountains and I can gain battery while being at the speed I want rather than careening off a cliff at 100 mph.
"Regen is activated when the cars computer tells it to be activated. How strong and how fast depending on modes and programming.

On Tesla brake pedal is directly connected to the mechanical breaks - there is no way to activate regen on Tesla using the brake pedal. All regen on Tesla is controlled by accelerator lift-off and the regeneration mode set in the settings. The mode determines the max regen amount allowed and that is the amount you get when you fully lift off the accelerator. There is no way to get more regen (well, unless you count switching the regen mode in settings).

Basically ALL other EV, in addition to what Tesla has ALSO have ADDITIONAL regen available fo the driver at all times using the brake pedal - the initial brake pedal action will be translated to increased regen. This way other EVs, like Taycan and e-tron can offer drivers FAR MORE regen power than Tesla can, up to 250kW of regen in some cases. Using that full regen feels like you've actually stepped on brakes. Which is why it can only be applied with the brake pedal - it is too strong to be activated on simple accelerator lift-off. And users can also use this in cooperation with a coasting mode to get the maximum efficiency out of coasting (which is more efficient that regen) while still having regen always available on the brake pedal.

The tech to do that was a bit immature in 2012 and Elon did not like it, that is why it is not available in Tesla. Others continued to perfect the tech and now it works perfectly, so there is no jarring transition from regen to braking anymore - most systems actually do both when the requested braking power is more than regen can provide. And some actually introduce feedback to the user in Eco driving modes (with a force feedback point) so that you can ""feel"" where is regen and where is mechanical braking to maximise your efficiency. Same tech is also used in PHEV cars."
Basically every ionity location
"As a small business owner that owns several delivery vehicles, we need a EV sprinter/transit van so bad. This would be a game changer whoever comes out with this first. Theres a huge market for this."
He again mentioned battery day will be hopefully in few months. I'm sure next year he will have some prototypes ready if not starting production already.
I know. Who likes getting more range overnight?
"Funny.  My car is in the shop after a crash and when I got my rental I was literally fumbling with the keys.  Granted, I had been keyless for a number of years before even getting the Tesla.

Not to mention that I literally thought there was something wrong with the car when I started accelerating onto the road for the first time with it.  Lots of noise, car barely moved.  Turns out it is just a normal low-end car.  I suspect an Audi would have been somewhat better in that regard but it took me days to get used to the lag every time I hit the pedal.  It is about as small as US cars get but it feels like a bus as far as responsiveness goes..."
"Yeah, it'll take a while for ccompetition to get a consistent easy user interface sorted and a good user experience. In the mean time Tesla will solidify its hold, chargers wise I'm sure there will end up being a few main suppliers. 

I wouldn't be at all surprised if Tesla eventually pulled out of charging all together. They needed to do them because you need the infrastructure to make the cars viable, and there's a critical mass point, anything under a certain level and EVs will fail. Once there's usable chargers everywhere then Tesla may well sell their's off, it's not like it's profitable."
"Yeah, while my Tesla was on order I was already researching L2 options and ended up signing up for ~3 services just to have some coverage.  I still sometimes run into a charger that I need to open a new account for.

Oh, and some of those services want you to maintain a cash balance with them.  As in they charge you $20-30 up-front and then you maintain a credit that you gradually use.  For something I might use a few times a year at most that is a lot of money to have in some account I might just completely forget about.  I can't imagine they'll be very proactive about returning it if I disappear for a few years.

Drives me nuts when these companies just refuse to use some kind of consolidation service, or just direct card payments.  Granted, I know the credit card companies kill companies with fees, but there has to be some way for a company to come up with the one EV card to rule them all, and not charge exorbitant fees.  But, then again that is also why you can't use Google/Apple Pay at Walmart - big companies don't trust each other to not start tacking on fees if they get too big, so they just refuse to interoperate."
And you mean Tesla go that money out of thin air?

"It's not about _bigger and more powerful_, it's about making a motor controller than can manage _creating and maintaining_ power at high RPMs.  Building a motor that can do high RPMs isn't the hard part.  Building a _system_ that can maintain power into the high RPMs is.

I don't doubt that Tesla can manage it, nevertheless.

EDIT: stupid fancy-pants editor."
I like that my car does not have a transmission. One less thing to maintain
"I guess I thought it was a given that there’s not actually a driveshaft in there, but maybe not. 

For me the point was that it can be eliminated in an EV, there isn’t an absolute need for it, like in fossils where there actually needs to be a driveshaft going to the back"
"Porsche cant stop doing what they have been doing for decades.  They see cars as parts and not as an entire things.  What parts are we replacing.  Well there is the fuel tank, it is now a batter and the engine is now electric.  Gear box stays, differential stays, HVAC stays, steering pump stays and so on."
"Its more like a differential, like that knuckle you see in between the rear wheels of a pickup."
I don't appreciate the resistance.
Settle down Amazon.
"In every Tesla ""car"" show room they are selling home solar installs and battery packs."
"I, too, want a Tesla fridge one day."
"It definitely is an executive attitude.

I work at a company that has areas where it was the best, or very close to it, but these were outsourced all the same.  Sometimes it is thinking that those areas just don't matter.  Often it is just a lack of vision as to how those areas could matter, or a lack of recognition of just how much internal expertise there is.  And sometimes it is just complacency - you don't get much internal complacency when most of your employees have been around less than 5 years.

It just reminds me of every time you hear somebody say that IT is a cost center.  Don't get me wrong, it is in one sense.  However, ultimately the only reason you have a product to sell is because you have a bazillion little cost centers that are all adding a bit of value to your product, resulting in something that people want to pay for.

Elon seems very detail-oriented, and he sees the value in what every facet of his business creates.  Some of those details don't add a whole lot of value, but they still add value.

Even some of the little omissions seem like they make sense, like not having a steering wheel heater.  I thought I'd really miss that having had one in my last car, but it doesn't really bother me.  That is largely because by the time I even get in the car it is already warm, and even if I forgot to plan ahead the thing heats up super-fast anyway.  I'm driving a rental right now and the thing feels like an iceberg in comparison, sometimes not even really being warm by the end of a 15min trip."
Its only applied during braking.  No one peddle driving.
The e-tron will brake and regenerate based on driver assist and mal data. So it will regenerate more when approaching and intersection and coast on a straight.
"According to reports I've heard, you can get about 260 miles on a charge doing an average of 65 on the freeway, with regen enabled. This lets the car run largely in the low end of second gear, which is significantly more efficient than running at the high end of first gear.

Of course, that's a full 1/3 less than the LR Model S's 373 mile range, using a battery pack that's only 7% smaller, making it ~25% less efficient. Or, compared to the Performance Model S, it's about 25% less range and 20% less efficient.

So even when it's being as efficient as possible, the Taycan is still no match for the Model S's range. But hey, it's Porche's first try."
TIL coasting = braking
"I would have sworn you were wrong, but I just went out and tested it, and damn you're right. I don't know how I didn't notice that before. I rarely monitor that on the Tesla, but do on the PHEV, and guess I just assumed the Tesla handled it the same way.

Which makes it very odd that Tesla doesn't take advantage hybrid braking when set for low regen, as it can increase range by a decent amount, and IMO the car is easier to drive with traditional ICE-like coasting."
"As with the cybertruck i am sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for new astounding tech to be announced, i will probably be disappointed but i hope the upcoming news is meaningful."
Has that actually happened though? Mostly it just seems like a display thing and efficiency of the cars hasn't changed. Mine hasn't.
"Yeah, even high-performance ICE vehicles have some latency when you press the accelerator.  At a minimum, there is a slight delay when they downshift or spin up a turbo.  That said, I still miss the sound of the motor (in a high-performance car) when you punch it."
"Interesting thoughts. I wonder though, even if the SC network is not profitable, but provides a major incentive over other EVs due to much cheaper charging rates, if that would be enough reason for them to continue expansion of the network??"
"Making a consistent easy user interface is easy.

As long as 1kWh of electricity is under 40 cents you can just use a contactless credit or debit card without a PIN.

So just have a display on the charging point that shows the pricing structure and then shows the charging rate and how much you charged once you begin charging.


So you drive up to the charger, plug your car in, hold your creditcard against the RFID point and that's it. CC gets charged when you unplug the car.

Fuck the entire app or account thing."
"In all fairness, Tesla didn’t get their money by over pricing their vehicles. They got it by selling their company as shares on a public exchange and leveraging a lot of debt in the beginning. Your point isn’t valid"
"No I mean they spend more money on the charging infrastructure and return on customers investment than most other auto manufacturers. Tesla doesn't have a racing team, and doesn't do any advertising. Not to mention they don't have a ridiculously overpaid board or CEO.

What did GM's CEO take home a couple years ago? 400 million dollars? And Chevy still can't make an electric vehicle worth a shit, nor even get their power steering pumps fucking working for more than three years?"
"But a bigger and more powerful motor (or more motors) will allow a higher top speed (and thus getting to that speed more quickly) whilst not sacrificing the low-end acceleration. Read: https://i.imgur.com/4L29YTn.png

If you go to the bottom-most graph/image in that URL, you'll see that a larger motor+gear outperforms a two-speed setup in every way.

The guy who wrote that designed and worked with motors for a living."
"That's illogical.

They went with a two-speed gearbox because it provides increased top-end acceleration. Just like Tesla did with their original roadster, only theirs kept blowing up, so they dropped it."
that's just how i conduct my business
"That's why I didn't question your mention of the home solar industry but only your mentions of the space industry and the wireless internet industry, which Tesla has no ambitions in."

"One peddle driving is not possible at any level.  I personally prefer the BMW i3 regen vs the Tesla S, its stronger and will come to a complete stop."
Sounds dangerously unpredictable.
"Thanks for the info.  At least they have made a start, there is a long long way to go, but you gotta start somewhere."
Fanboys downvoting your original post even though it's the truth. It's like they automatically think anything Tesla does must be the best lmao.
"Maybe he's talking about the times when Tesla unlocks the range on software-locked batteries during emergencies? They've done it a few times for 60Ds in wildfire and hurricane areas, temporarily turning them into 75Ds. They probably do the same thing for Model 3 SRs (non-plus), too."
"At the moment, sure, it's a huge competitive edge for Tesla"
"Yeah but that would be end user friendly, what they want is to lock you into paying a monthly fee for their infrastructure, and if that shit gets traction it's going to be ugly"
"That's as valid as any other way of making money, and much smarter than directly passing the cost on to your customers."
Then why is the P100D now 50k cheaper?
"A bigger and more powerful motor costs a lot more and weighs a lot more. You are right that you can use lower gear ratios with a bigger motor and thus reach a high speed without sacrificing performance at low speeds. However, it's not an efficient use of space, money or weight. It makes much more sense to use a smaller lighter motor that is designed to reach higher rpm using methods such as flux weakening while maintaining peak power output over a larger range of speeds"
But you don't need a gearbox for high speed top end with an electric car.  Just have different gearing on the front and rear differentials.  A gearbox is added complexity with no reward.
"What is this, armature hour?"
Keep doing it and someone might re-volt
It will come with a dent in it.
"You can already pay a 50$ deposit on www.teslacool.com I just did it, I got order number 14239!"
Its not.
So adaptive cruise control and things like stop sign detection and acting on that in the future is dangerous on Tesla’s?
"The tires make a huge difference.  The Taycan uses tires that are optimized for grip and handling, not efficiency."
"No. My Tesla is 5% faster over the air due to enhancements in the motor software. Also better range due to efficiency increase, again, via over the air software updates"
"But will it ever not be?? If competitors are big oil companies, then they'll just end up tryin to charge as much per mile as they do for gasoline now and never be truly competitive..."
"I'm not talking about stuff provided by the manufacturer.

So no mercedes only charging infrastructure."
"The author of the article said that weight will be relatively negligible. Even 50 more kg only affects the weight of the entire vehicle by around 2.5%. If flux weakening was effective, why hasn't Tesla already used that technique?"
How’s that working for Tesla...... they are going to 3 motors for top end acceleration. Talk about added complexity with no reward....
I was feeling rather positive about myself until that comment
that someone might get charged
Ohmmmm 🙏
The fridge in my kitchen has a dent in it.  Discount!
"Having different behavior when you lift your foot off the accelerator. If I’m expecting the car to slow down if I’m approaching another car and it starts to coast, which means I need to quickly realize I’m not slowing and need to hit the brake- that’s the scenario I’m thinking of."
"I understand this, but with the way batteries and charging at the moment, they could have compromised a little with the tyres to make a better car.  Having said that, having variety is probably a good thing.  Some people will want this."
A P100D comes with Michelin Super Sports.  They have a 300 ware rating.
"I don't think they've actually made any efficiency increases with OTA updates. If you're talking about the 325 mile range boost on LR RWD Model 3s from early last year, that was just a display change. Everyone knew the car actually had a longer range than 310 the whole time. Tesla just eventually sent an update that made it official."
"2.5% will make a surprising difference to a lot of things when talking about performance tbh. Also, Tesla definitely uses flux weakening, especially with the model 3's IPM motors

EDIT: IPM motors actually use something called MTPA or maximum torque per amp, which isn't really flux weakening but is the same idea"
"Don't forget the 2 electric motors for the windows, the 1 for steering and another for steering wheel adjustment, also one for each seat.  Ohh and the rear hatch.  


We are up to, 3+2+1+1+2+1, 10.  10!  Ten electric motors!  Tesla's are too complex and will never make it, short short short :)"
Care to relay how you feel currently?
"> they could have compromised a little with the tyres to make a better car.

You are assuming a better car means longer range.  There is a trade-off though.  Porsche owners may think performance matters more, so sacrificing handling for range would actually make the car worse."
They did make the car 5% faster few months back.
"But if you think an added gear box for top end speed is worthless complexity you **must** think an added motor is. 

Don’t just deflect with jokes. Otherwise I have to assume you agree but are too proud to admit it."
"well I'm energetic, but once i felt negative and got charged with battery.."
"Yes it's a fair point, but I think the range issue will hold it back a lot."
"I am going to assume all 3 motors are whats in the rear of the Model S/X.  So its to make it cheaper to build as they are using already off the shelf parts.  Or ... they got some race car drivers who illuminated the need for finely tuned rear wheel control on the track.  Having one wheel regen / drag while the other accelerates for better turn in.  


Its probably the first but will be explained as the second.  Is more motors more complex?  Yea.  Are they more complex than any single transmission?  No."
"We've gone too deep into the ground. I'm going to have to terminate my end of this, but good day to you sir."
"We'll see.  I don't think most people are taking their Porsche on road trips or using them for 100+ mile daily commutes, but it is definitely one aspect where the car is lacking."
"No. The motor configuration is the same as the AWD configuration (one motor front and one motor rear) but in the tri motor there is an extra one with different gearing both rear wheels can switch to. 

So there is no, one motor on each rear wheel. 

Sounds like you just agree with what ever Tesla does blindly. You do not even know their configuration yet you are making things up to rationalize it.

There is zero way to rationalize an extra motor being less needlessly complex then an extra gear. Sure maybe cheaper for them, but it’s needlessly complex to the extreme."
you're leaving? I'm shocked! ⚡
"Agree, yes.  Blindly, no.  


Owning their product (Model S P90DL+) I can vouch for the decisions.  Having also owned a Porsche right before my Tesla I can speak to the differences in philosophy.  The Porsche Taken is a real let down.  Everything from having a start button, the transmission tunnel, range and naming convention (there is no fucking turbo in an electric car).  


If Tesla engineers feel the need for an extra motor they have their good reasons.  Porsche needing a transmission is asinine like having to remove the rear assembly of the car to change an air filter.  They add complexity to have complexity.  


 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hExfAdsPZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hExfAdsPZE)"
Ohm my god
"Can’t say I agree. I would say that is equivalent to a  “faith” argument. The exact same logic could be used to justify the gears in the Porsche with zero modification.

“I trust them so they are right” is not a decent argument."
I’m glad someone else broke the chain. That was hilarious.
"Its a track record question.  


Take 2x surgeons.  Ones patients go home after surgery within 2-3 days and the others stay for more then a week on a consistent basis.  Who's recommendation would you stand behind on how to deal with post-OP, building a new surgery wing at a hospital?"
"it's ok, someone will rectify that"
"Objectively Porsche has one of, if not the best, track record for performance vehicles in history.

Tesla has overall been known for unreliable EV vehicles with quick 0-60 times, semi-autonomous features and a lot of tech.

Not sure what your getting at but I don’t think that point agrees with your conclusion."
A quick jumpstart will get it pulsing again.
Objectively my Tesla needs no service other than tires going on 70k miles where my Porsche needed $1500 worth every 10k miles plus the same tires (they both use Michelin Super Sports).
"So you are judging adding a 3rd motor being less complex and a better design then a second gear because your Porsche needed service?

I think you lost the plot a few posts ago. We are not taking about economy cars here."
"You argued that Porsche had superior reliability with a track record to prove it.  


I on the other hand have owned and lived with one and can tell you with all certainty that if my Porsche did not get its service every 10k miles, it would have bricked itself.  Fuck man the thing ate oil a quart every 1-2k miles.  If you left it not running for more than 3 days it shot out a plum of smoke because the cylinders are sideways and oil seeps through the heads and pools in the combustion chamber.  This is somehow normal according to my dealer!  On a brand new car!  


I cannot defend nor do I trust any engineering decision Porsche makes.  They have figured out how to build race cars that can do one more lap than needed better than any other car company.  But that does not equate to a reliable every day car."
Can’t say my experience or the general consensus of Porsche agrees with your opinion.
"Damn, 8 months ahead of schedule and 35 more miles of range than previously announced. Good shit. I hope it takes off."
"I don't want to treat my Model 3 like a cell phone and get a new car every 2 years but damn I kinda want a Model Y now lol.

I still love my 3 with a passion!"
Holy shit Tesla is getting things done *ahead* of time? What universe is this.
Wasn't stoked on the Model Y. I am now stoked.
18inch wheels are no longer available. And the price has gone up. However my order still has the 18 inch wheels listed and the previous price....I wonder how they are going to deal with this.
Now give me your LR AWD 3's!!
"I noticed the Black interior just says ""2nd row seats that fold flat"" where the black and white says ""Three independently folding 2nd row seats""."
"So, changes from yesterday: RWD variant was removed, and the LR AWD version went up by $990.

Performance package is also an optional, free upgrade to the performance model.  So you aren't stuck with the big tires if you don't want them.

Performance package is now also an optional upgrade on Model 3."
"Incredible! 315 mile range! Also, no longer see RWD LR option anymore. If dual motor is 315 miles, what will RWD be in the future?!?"
Can’t preorder the 7 seater.
Hopefully people will upgrade their Model 3s so there will finally be used Model 3 inventory for me to snag one :)
only $100 too now
"No 18 inch wheels? :(

Hopefully the Aeros still actually fit, even if you can’t order with them."
Regret not putting in an order for LR RWD... Don't need the AWD...
"Fascinating tidbit in the release: ""Due to ramp of Model 3 in
Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, production will likely outpace deliveries this year."" 

ie: Their reserve numbers are below 500,000. So likely reservation folk won't be too badly backed up"
They’re going with SIX year gas savings estimates now. Used to be five.
"Interesting, both the y and the 3 performance come in stealth by default, with a free option to upgrade breaks wheels pedal spoiler and top speed."
Looks around for gently used Model 3
damn. murdered out black w/ the 20'' induction wheels!
WHAT
Wasn't LR AWD 52k last week? It's 52.9k now.
Really wish these had the towing option in the US.
Now I'm debating if I should put in the order for an AWD MY instead of a M3. I would need to get a new vehicle by May 1st though so I'm sure that my delivery date would be much later in the year :/
"So, who has an rwd reservation and waiting it out, and who of you are going to upgrade to the awd?
I'm going to wait it out but I hope I get it this year"
"I ordered Long Range RWD, what happens now?"
"Y AWD is 1k more expensive.  
3 AWD is 1k cheaper."
"So basically from what I can tell on the website, the model 3 and model Y are available in Stealth Performance, or in Flashy Performance.

Dope."
"Has anyone found info on what tires will be on each wheel? I had originally ordered with 18"" Aeros, but just edited to 19"" Gemini (I think they look a little bit better). I'm actually very tempted to switch to the 20"" Induction but want to know if they're going to be wrapped in all-seasons or performance tires (I prefer all-seasons for the driving we do)."
"If I could get the performance Y with the performance upgrade, but swap the 21” wheels for the 20” induction wheels, I’d order today."
[best wheels](https://i.imgur.com/ufvooiR.png)
I’m really tempted to trade in my 3 AWD+ LR for the Y performance but damn it’s expensive lol
"I’m a Nj resident and kinda bummed about the price increase. This puts the 7 seater above $55,00 and thus not eligible for the $5000 rebate. Oh well"
"Hell yes, I'll take the extra 35 miles.  Thanks.

$990 more.  Oops.  If I wanted to change to the white interior, I should have done that yesterday, huh?  ;|

I wonder what will happen with the wheels since I'm sure most of us here have the 18"" Aero wheels.  I expect it will automatically get upgraded to the 19"" but that's not actually stated anywhere.  Did they do anything like this with the Model 3?

The Performance options are not completely clear.  There is the option select then a checkbox.  All I see change with the +$8K selection is some speed values.  The exterior only seems to adjust (wheels, brakes, etc) with the check box.  The check box does not add cost.  Odd.  This should be better detailed on the page, I think."
"Just ordered a MYP in white

can't wait for delivery."
No more aero tires :(
I hope this drops the aftermarket price of the model 3!
"I would be willing to bet that the wheel changes were partially to help them achieve the 315mi range. The wheel options are all much more akin to aero wheels, more streamlined with smaller gaps in them. A big win, still very attractive but more functional."
Towing hitch? Any confirmation yet?
Oh how I wish I wasn’t poor
"How cool would it be if all the Model Y's have the new battery tech and soon after battery investor day, they push out an update that unlocks their full range capabilities."
"Super hard not to just put in an order, but forcing myself to keep holding out until they make a few changes.

Guess I could put it in and just keep deferring delivery? Does that even work?"
"Interested in upgrading to those 20” induction wheels, but not wanting to do that if that also changes my base price up $990, causing it to be a $2990 total upgrade.. maybe I’d be better off in buying some aftermarket options?"
"I was super stoked about the 7 seats, now depression has set in at having to wait till 2021 :("
"$2k cheaper than my AWD 3 from Aug 2018 with equal configuration. If you count the tax credit in my favor, it's $5500 more than my 3. Not bad!"
"Just looked at my order online again. So it's now showing rwd long range again, but it also has the 19"" wheels which I love. Price hasn't changed either. Same as when I put the deposit down. 

Maybe it will he a software thing? Just turn off one of the motors? Still would like a concrete answer."
Black on black looks sweet.
"I really can’t wrap my head around the price not changing if you don’t get the performance options. On lots of other cars I’ve bought simply upgrading to the performance brakes (Brembo or otherwise) can be a multi-thousand dollar option. It seems really weird that you can either get the Tesla equivalent or not for the same amount of money?

It would be a pain in the ass but it almost seems like you’re better off getting all the options, even if you don’t want them, then parting it out and selling them while downgrading to normal brakes and wheels? It’s very odd Tesla seems to be creating a situation where such a thing would be theoretically possible?"
do we think that the LR AWD non-P will have an acceleration boost paid option?
I'm ordering the day the 7 seater option becomes available.
7 seater still 2021....ugggg!
"Seems it’s $1k more expensive now. Before a Long Range AWD with FSD and grey paint was $60k even and now it’s 60,990"
WOOOOOOOOOOOW and those wheels!
"So if you got the 19” sport wheels, does that give you the 20” black induction set?

Edit: Seems not, you are given the Gemini wheels"
What would be a good reason to get the regular performance model without the performance package instead of the LR AWD besides just the added acceleration?
Those Überturbine Wheels are such a vibe. I like them.
My current lease ends in October. Wasn't expecting to potentially get this car early. Does tesla let you move positions if you're in this predicament?
Nice! And the NJ EV rebate shows up. Pretty awesome.
remember under promise and over deliver:)
They only need to ship one for it to be true.
How does a long range dual motor Model Y have basically the same range as a long range dual motor Model 3? Bigger battery?
I just want to know the cargo capacity with the rear seats up. Why is this info so hard to come by?
Anyone know if you can add the 3rd row seats later when it's available?
"Lots of great stuff, but very little information.  I want to know some thing other than the price.  Does it tow?  What does it tow? Will that be an option one day?  I’m sure other people have other questions.  I really want a Tesla but I get annoyed when they act like Apple."
"NEED.TO.SEE.THIRD.ROW.

Why are there no pictures of this?!?!?!?!"
Just ordered mine 😍.
They definitely sandbagged the range here to not cannibalize 3 sales. Smart move for shareholders and the company.
"I've heard a lot of negative things about the 21in rims (potholes, lack of winter options). Any idea whether the tires will be 245/40R21 or 245/35R21 Pzeros? Is it likely that the 20in induction wheels will fit over the performance break upgrade? Trying to decide if I should get the 19in wheels due to more tire options then swap for 20s. I feel like I am missing out on ""free"" performance upgrades if I go with the 19s."
Have a LR RWD on order so I wonder what’ll happen. Also shows basic AP included if you order today but when I ordered that wasn’t the case. I hope they’ll add basic AP to all previous orders like mine now that it’s standard
any clue on the ground clearance?
Am I the only one who wants the white interior but with the wood on the dash? Basically the only thing I want to be white are the seats themselves.
"I pre-ordered a performance. It's giving me 20 inch wheels not the 21.

&#x200B;

 I don't like the new 21 inch rims. The LR has option for 20 inch black rims which I would prefer on the performance version. 

&#x200B;

SO confused on what my order will end up being. Does anyone have experience with this? How will they adjust my config?"
They should rename it Model Ÿ for the second edition and pronounce it funny.
Thank god you can get those black wheels on the lower trims. It's kinda ugly without them.
"So if the Model Y range just jumped to being the same as the Model 3, does that mean we can expect a slight range boost in the model 3 soon? 

Come oooooon OTA range increase!!!"
"odd that the model Y lists as 66cu of storage but the 3 only 15. Are they measuring the Y with it's seats down but not the 3?  

EDIT:Odd that i'm being downvoted for this. It's a fair question and relevant to the topic. Typical reddit.."
"Damn I like the 20"" wheels but not available on the Performance"
Any news on official towing capabilities?
"They updated my order and dropped the price 5k. I am getting performance option, white exterior/interior, 7 seat, fsd for 69,000. It was 74k when I order it. Crazy. Check your reservation."
"Why would anyone want this small car in a 7 seat configuration, unless you're a family of Smurfs?"
Austrian website still says that production will start in 2021:<
wait there's actually a difference between the white and black interior now...only the white one comes with power-folding rear seats
Do you think the Model Y will see a price increase once deliveries begin? I can't remember if I read that this happened with the M3.
"Oh shit my country isn't there in options. 3,s and x is. Will I not be able to get it??"
Any idea if they will offer the speed upgrade for the LR AWD like they did with Model 3? I really wanted performance Y but I am not a fan of either wheel option.
"The Norwegian site still says that the production will start in early 2021, any idea when the European deliveries will actually start?"
MASSIVE
"Was price locked in for preorders if you didn't make any changes? I went ahead and switched my wheels to the 20"" but didn't see if the price was the same prior to the change."
Performance Version has a free upgrade option?
"I’m assuming my Performance Y with the 20’s will just automatically get upgraded to the Überturbo 21’s now instead?

Also, my cash price is $70,000 on my order page, but in the configurator it’s now $67,500 (with the same options I previously had selected- performance, white exterior, black interior, 5 seat and FSD). 

Wonder if I’ll still have to pay the $70k?"
Model Y configuration available for LHD Europe now also.
"No longer eligible for MA incentive. $2,500 is not a deal breaker but would have been nice."
Alright Elon... now do the Cybertruck.
Just noticed that the 7 seater is 3k extra. So if u get a 5 seater how is this different from a model 3?
"I'm sad. For Luxembourg (and I guess the rest of Europe) it now says early 2021 for LR and P models, before it said end of 2020. And SR in 2022...

Also the range info didn't change"
I wonder if Model Y would also offer an acceleration boost like model 3
Waiting I saw one on the toads in Austin the other day
"Why does the website states that Model Y will charge faster than Model 3. Is that just software, or did they equip it with better hardware?"
Y wouldn't we?
"I see where you are coming from. 

I  going to stash money away and sit on our Zoe for a bit longer; it’s doing just fine but it doesn’t do distances and i fear the battery won’t last. 

With all these interesting vehicles coming out in the very near future at price points that are interesting (and this is just Tesla) I want to be ready when my model comes along. 

I would buy a cybertruck if only it was a bit smaller. Who knows what the final model will be like!"
"German configurator is up as well - 59.6k€ for long range and 66.6k€ for performance. Estimated production start ""Beginning of 2021"". Base Autopilot included, FSD for 6.3k. Deposit: 2k."
And you don’t live in Jersey for sure haha. Annoyed people plant flowers in potholes they are so big just saw the town see them.
"Pulled the trigger this morning on a Model Y (AWD Performance, not 21"" wheels...) Grey, white interior. 

Now it's the waiting game...again."
"Wife and I are like, but we are not ready yet ...lol

we wanted to stretch out our 11yo family van as long as possible since it still drives great

however, we will still like to take the delivery early than late !"
"If I want a AWD LR Model Y in Q4, when do you think would be the time to order?"
They should.
So if I ordered now when would I get it?
"If I order a Model Y on their site right now, how long will it take to get it? I live in LA."
Anyone know if the 19’’ Gemini Wheels are simpler wheels with a cap on them or are they alloys?
"I just ordered on Sunday, any chance I’d actually get it in the next few months?"
Is the Y going to basically be the size of a Honda HRV?
"Wow, I am glad I have my model Y pre-order in. The price increase is significant. But so are the improved specs!"
stonks
I wonder if / when they will provide blacked out handles and trim for the model 3.
"Man.. I'm really liking how the Y looks and everything, but the M3 is the most realistic option of all of them, plus the incentives."
"If I don’t upgrade my 3 soon, I’m at least interested in upgrading to those 19” Gemini wheels. 


Side note does FSD live on the car or on the account? If I sell / trade in my model 3 for a Y, any chance my FSD package will transfer to the new car?"
What happens to the $2500 reservation that I put in March of last year? Now it’s $100? Since my reservation is a LR awd and I added the 19” wheels as a $1500 upgrade does that now get knocked off the price?
Price increase? It cost $1000 more then before for LR AWD
"If I order one now, does anyone know when I'll get it?  Black/Black Long Range"
"I'm so torn between a new model y, or a used model x. It'll come down to which one fits our dogs best. Lol."
Will the Model Y have a LRWD?
$100 deposit! Take my money Tesla! Ordered a LR AWD Red with white interior and 19” rims.
"Hum, Canada says mid 2020, there goes the Canada deliveries early rumors, not that I believed them anyway."
I really hope I get one in March. But I feel like I won't get my preorder till april or may.
If I pre-ordered the car last year with the 19in sports wheels.. Will I still get those wheels?
"I just spoke with a Tesla rep in their online chat, and expressed my interest in the LR RWD Model Y due to the perceived increased range over Dual Motor AWD. I asked if this variant would be available, and he said that they are focused on the dual motor variants right now, and that they would share more information closer to launch. Hopefully that means they will be available down the road. I'm really hoping for a 335-340 range Model Y!"
Here is a quick overview I made with the new wheel options!  [https://imgur.com/a/PL4ERMT](https://imgur.com/a/PL4ERMT)
Anyone know if it has a hitch standard? i don't see an option.
"Well now I have a conundrum. I ordered a long time ago with 18"" wheels. I like these new 19s better, and it looks like it will actually lower my price by $500 thanks to paint price changes. If I do edit my order, will my place in the delivery queue change?

Edit: I just checked my order again, and now it shows the 19"" wheels already. I never did anything to actually edit my order."
Was hoping they’d keep the LR RWD but this is exciting!
I wasn’t able to listen or read the document yet. Any idea when there will be Model Ys in a dealership?
I just noticed they replaced the $2500 refundable deposit that the 3 had with a $100 non-refundable order fee.
So basically the Y performance without the performance package is the stealth version. Stealth version became an official option!
"I really really just want a damn sunroof in an electric car... I know it’ll increase the drag coefficient but, Tesla has or will be greatly increasing the energy density in its power packs."
So glad I don’t work at that factory anymore. Yikes
is there a super secret cheaper option that you can only get by calling in by phone?
Whats the difference with Tesla Y and Tesla X?
"almost 60k€ for the cheapest option you can configure.

Way too much for the market its in unless you are en enthusiast with a pile of spare cash.

I didn't expect it to be that much more expensive than the model 3 with this almost 20k higher base price."
No track mode for Model Y?
Adding the performance option currently doesn’t change the price. Makes no sense. Must be some kind of glitch.
looking good
Any ideas how they handle/how much they give a model 3 LRAWD trade in?

Just put my order in! Hopefully I can end up getting one by August when my lease is up.
My reservation with FSD and performance is 65K. Looks like price went up 4K. I'd rather have the miles. Can I change?
Even the rims have changed.
WTF happened to Elon time ?  Love Elon.

Should I put the 100 down even tho I’m not getting a model untill abt 2023
"""Seven Seat Interior Available in 2021"" I wonder if that can be upgraded to from the version that will be available soonest."
"You guys go ahead and order the early production Model Y. You can grin and bare the early production issues like we did with Model 3 and report back to make the Q2/Q3/Q4 cars better. _but it would be nearly as bad/etc etc_. Maybe not, but you don’t know. 

 I’ll wait until they’re in inventory and then grab one when a better referral incentive pops it’s head up. Looking forward to it!"
[deleted]
"Someone convince me why the Model Y Performance is worth $5000 more than the Model 3 Performance.  Also, why wouldn’t I choose the performance upgrade if it’s the same price?  (Just range?)"
[deleted]
Anyone think maxwell is the reason for the increased range?
"Are these not for sale already? I'm pretty sure I've spotted one of these rolling around my town. It looked like a fat model 3, maybe it was a model x. I could have sworn it was like a portly version of the model 3."
"$63k and it doesn’t have a CD player?

Fuck off."
">If one motor stops working, you can safely continue to your destination with the second.

Is this new? Also this doesn't sound all that honest, since there is no transmission, there is no way to decouple one motor. If there is a significant mechanical issue with the motor you probably wouldn't be able to keep driving - certainly not advisable like the advertising seems to infer."
Looks like a Prius from the angle in the pic
"Does this mean by 2023 all the kinks should be out? No dodgy gaps, paint and on and on...?"
"Destination and doc fee??? Wtf is that supposed to be!?!? I can get a used Corolla for that ... lol

Didn’t think Tesla would employ that silly tactic ... :-("
Shame all Tesla's are so ugly
The stock? It already has
"The stock went uo by 80$ (like 15%) and then back down to ""only"" a 70$ increase for the day (13-14%) I watched the stock live. Looked crazy"
Hopefully this happens to the Cybertruck!
"Hang on to the Model 3 but start paying all the costs of buying a model Y into a piggy bank labelled ROADSTER V2.0

:D"
I for one am waiting for used 3s to hit the market. Please go ahead and get a Y ;)
I am just waiting for Cybertruck instead!
Don't give in to the hype. The 3 is going to be a lot more fun to drive.
My real issue is that I spent extra for FSD and would get nothing extra on trade for my car vs the EAP that existed.
If they let me move my FSD that they still haven’t actually delivered over to the Y from my 3 I’d do it in a minute. But losing everything I paid for FSD when I trade in is ridiculous.
"New year, new ElonTime^TM"
"Someone just explained to Elon (and got it to sink in) that it doesn't matter when your gadget is ready.  What matters is that it is early.

No one knows how long it's supposed to take to bring an electric SUV to market.  If it's going to take 18 months, then announce it's going to take 19 months so you can beat your estimate."
"Same, just Tesla has more disciplined messaging, and managing expectations."
Model 3 was ahead of time as well.
Come on Roadster!
Welcome to Earth Prime
"It is crazy... My CyberTruck estimate has moved up six months since I put my deposit down ... They're saying it'll be one of the quicker factory assembly lines, is it due to the shape and new wiring system? Continue to be impressed."
"New Calendar, who dis?"
"Oh...Performance is still 280 :'( I really want to get that version but would love to keep the mileage. Ugh.

EDIT: I am wrong, only when choosing the performance upgrade, which makes the tires larger (which in turn lowers mileage). Makes sense. I am sleepy."
Same. But I don't have a reason to get rid of my Mustang yet... 🤔
"I'm in the same boat. I'm hoping they'll upgrade me to the 19"" wheels. They look way better than the 18"" ones imo."
"Can we talk about those sexy 20"" Induction wheels though?? I absolutely love them. Goes so well with the standard chrome delete"
"I wouldn't touch it because your price will change. I'm assuming the ""Aeros 18"" will fill with the Gemini 19"" and so on with the other wheel choices."
"That is disappointing. I don’t want wheels larger than 18”, but now there’s no choice."
In the past the options for a locked in order with a configuration that no longer exists have been pretty reasonable.
"And while the 20"" wheels do *look* sexy, the 18"" were likely much more range efficient.  Wonder if we can keep them?"
I ordered on reveal night and the price has dropped quite a bit since then. Only problem is that I have the 7 seat configuration so I can’t change it right now.
The same way they deal with every other exception. They tell you to F off by ignoring you.
I hate the gemini wheels. Changed to 20 inch induction. Thanks for bringing this up.
"Did you order AWD before? It's no longer showing the RWD option, hence the price increase."
"Actually, price went down bc 19s were $1500 more so it’s only $990 now. I think 19s is best bc 18 are too small!"
"They will probably make your order, consider it the ""pre order special"""
"hopefully I can call before delivery to upgrade to the 20"" induction wheels"
What's your offer? I'm legit serious
Now that's a good spot. Probably just bad proof-reading and based on Google Search + latest captured pictures I'm guessing three independently folding seats which is a nice feature.
"That’s pretty useful for hauling snowboards through the middle seat so people can sit in the outer seats.

Edit: someone else pointed out that the main Model Y page mentions “Each second row seat folds flat independently...” without mentioning that it’s an option. And the picture shows the black interior with the three seats folded down. So it’s probably the same for both colors."
"Looks like part of that is the new wheels.  18"" Aeros replaced by the 19"" Geminis."
So stealth model 3 is available from the website now? Cool!
"It went up buy $990, not range went up by 35 miles."
"> upgrade

I don't think you know what that word means. The performance model without PUP features (P3D- or ""stealth"") is the same price as the full P3D was and is. It's not an upgrade, it's a downgrade. Or a price hike for the stealth if you prefer. Any other summary of the price change is an underhanded marketing spin."
I assume LR RWD will be discontinued like it was for Model 3. Will still be interesting to see what it'll be like for people who already ordered LR RWD.
"Question, are these improvements auto-applied to existing pre-orders?

I have a LR AWD that I locked in for 280 miles and 18"" wheels. Will that be what I'm getting? Or will it automatically come with 315 miles and 19"" wheels?"
"What does this mean for the Model 3? If they can get 315 miles on the bulkier Y, can they push up the range for the 3?"
"When the the Model S dual motor was added, the dual motor had *higher* range than the RWD.

This is because one of the motors could be smaller and therefore more efficient for highway cruising, and two motors can regen better than one.

Was the Model 3 RWD vs AWD different than this...?"
Not making them until 2021
not delivering until next year anyways
You could pre-order it before. Would’ve liked to see it stay to gauge demand. Worries me a little whether they’ll follow through or if there winds up being  enough 5-seater demand that it keeps getting pushed indefinitely.
Yeah odd. I already pre-ordered a performance 7 seater a few months ago but now shows no ability to pre-order and shows 2021 date. Wonder if that’ll change.
"Same, is it a bug? Or are they not offering it anymore?"
Who would want to pre order that before seeing it?
"Get an X if you need 7 seats, 3rd row in the Y is gonna be small."
Yes!!!
"Wow that’s much cheaper than Model 3, I think they start at like $35k"
"Just remember, it's a fee, not a deposit.  So there's no refunds and it does not go towards your purchase price"
"I think the Model Y wheels are wider. The 19"" Gemeni seems to be the new ""Aero"" wheel for the Model Y."
"I put mine in a few days ago expecting something big to change today, not sure if that was a good idea or not!"
"Relax, it will be available off the menu."
With the AWD you'll have to replace the tires less often because the Regen brakes are distributed between the front and rear instead of just the rear.
"I took this as meaning their production process is more efficient and effective than their delivery process, esp. since this year (2020) all Model Y will come from Fremont, overseas delivery is still slow."
Fingers crossed that this results in lower prices!
I mean the loans are 6 years so I guess it makes sense? I always hated how they show the “price” on the website. It is very misleading to a lot of people.
This is very sneaky of tesla. Not a fan of this at all
"Adding the Optional thing for 3 doesn't increase the price.  Also for the 3 the 19"" wheel option is no longer on the site."
Super weird to me that the Performance Upgrade option doesn’t change the price.
"Where do you see something about a spoiler?  Just curious because I don’t see it, but I’d love to have one."
How do you order the Stealth??
21’’ Überturbine Wheels
**DESIGN YOUR MODEL Y | TESLA (MODEL Y DELIVERIES BEGINNING MARCH 2020)**
Yup!  And it's switched to the $100 fee as well!
"What’s the towing option?

Edit: Good ol’ r/TeslaMotors. Downvoting for a legitimate question."
Same. I put in an order for a M3P two weeks ago but debating if I should switch to a LR Y but also need a new vehicle before May as well. Does anyone know if the Y is sticking to the regular delivery route as in East coast then West coast? I live near the Fremont factory.
"I think we will wait it out a bit. We were planning on hoping to have the car may/June anyway. I wanna see what happens. If I look at my account it shows as long range rwd, but we got the 19"" inch wheels (which lol great!!). Still the price as when we pre-ordered.  My hope is that it's something like they turn off one of the motors via software or something.  And we don't have to wait forever.   

But it would be great to get some official word from Tesla. If we knew we would have to wait a year, we'd probably upgrade to AWD if need be."
Hoping for some word from Tesla regarding it before I make a decision. The process to get the 2500 dollars back and re order at a 4-5k upcharge would suck. My price is locked in at 48.5k (just regular AP and Grey paint) while the same config in AWD would be 53k if I saw correctly. That’s quite a difference
"waiting it out as well.  i ordered LR RWD 5-seater with the free black paint (at the time), 19"" wheels, Autopilot (NOT free at the time), premium blk interior.  Now it's showing the exact same specs except i have the 20"" wheels and my price DROPPED by $3000."
"I had a LR RWD reserved, but when my rims got automatically upgraded (I had ordered 19), it changed from silver to black.  Hate the black rims against deep metallic blue (I'm too old to pull it off).

Now, as I head back in to the app to change my order, seriously considering AWD for the few extra grand.  Part of that is really wanting the car by SEP as I have a lot of travel planned."
Same. Im sure we will get more answers after their conference call in a few hours. Did you have AP in your order?
"I thought the model 3 AWD has been $48,990 for a while now?"
"If you zoom in reeeeeeeeeally far, you can see that they're a Goodyear Eagle of some kind. I can't make out the model, but my best guess is a GT II, which is all-season."
"Same, we get enough snow and ice here there is no way in hell we're running performance tires. Don't really want to have to swap them at each season change either."
"you could likely sell the 21s for pretty penny and buy the 20s later, or wait for companies to replica them for cheaper"
Do you think the 20s will clear the performace upgrade brakes?
Don’t ever get 20s. Regret from Jersey.
"Yeah. Too expensive. Not worth it. Also, I am not going to buy new cars anymore. Will wait and buy a used model y in few years. Cybertruck is also an exciting option..."
Hehe... I thought you were saying you had THREE Tesla's to trade in and yet were complaining about the expense of the new car. Was about to get all up in your shit about budget management/restraint tinged with a high degree of jealousy.
"Can you retrofit with the 3rd row later, with the money you got from the rebate?"
"The bill that was signed states MSRP under $55k. Options if they are line items, shouldn’t change this but I’d be curious to see how it pans out."
"Yeah, is the performance pack really free?  I'd take all of it except for the suspension :)"
"Yeah. Practical and attractive, esp without the aero covers. They can be bought from Tesla for $2k/set with tires, so maybe a dealer can make the swap at no cost."
What changes are you waiting for?
"I did that for a few months in July 2018 for the model 3 so yes, possible."
You can put in an order and defer delivery as long as you like. Should have put in an order before...
"Yeah, I wanna see them release the tow hitch and hopefully make a price differential between the performance and performance with performance pack. Weird that they’re the same price now for no clear reason.

I would really also like them to allow moving FSD to this car as an EAP+FSD Model 3 owner who literally has not gotten any benefit from FSD. Feels idiotic to trade in a car with a feature I never received and not get any more money for the trade but have to pay for FSD all over."
"Same boat except I locked in FSD at 6k. Gonna go aftermarket for sure or maybe the 20"" will go on sale on Teslas site sooner than later."
"Submitted my order a month or so ago and I’ve got LRRWD, AP and 20in wheels. Everything is the same besides the wheels changed to the 20s when I had previously selected the 19s. Those 20s are beautiful though so we will stick with those."
Mine shows the 19 inch wheels to which I’m glad. Did you have AP on yours when you put the deposit down? I didn’t add it but it’s now standard but still doesn’t show on my reservation. Does your show it?
"You could do that with any car. You're looking at it from the wrong direction though. The price of the Performance has not changed. What changed is that they added a ""lessor"" version of the Performance but keep the price the same. So unless they change the pricing, they're banking on people paying the same amount of money for an overall less expensive car (without all of the more ""premium"" hardware such as the brakes, wheels, etc.).

The Model 3 performance price didn't change at all. So if you pay for the performance options, you're getting exactly what you would have got by ordering the performance last week. What they should be doing is reducing the price of the Performance without the ""performance package""."
But aren’t those seats tiny and space back there cramped? I was initially interested but I am swayed to a used Model X after looking at the 7 seater pictures!
Performance became whopping $10 cheaper!
But the 19s wheel is standard so it went down!
Did the price of ur order go up by $990?
"I think its too early to tell. I would assume you would get the upgraded wheels, otherwise where does your $1500 go?"
I personally don't want the XL wheels and lowered suspension. Terrible roads where I live and range loss.
you can defer delivery
"Same dillema here. We are gonna get the 21” and if allmelse fails, I'm sure someone else will be more than happy to trade."
Me too. Plan on trading w someone.
All of the wheel options for the Y are awful. 18-in aero wheels with no covers are still the best wheel Tesla has done (besides the Roadster 2.0).
That's typical for sedans vs small suvs from any mfr
"Well many families tend to have children, and these children aren't fully grown yet and can fit is smaller spaces."
Don't hold your breath for them to update the site anytime soon.  Looks like only Canada and US sites updated.  I am also wondering if I will see my RWD order in Austria before the end of the year!
"Same in Italy. I wonder if that means that Europe won't have the Y imported from California but rather they expect to make it available here directly from Gigafactory in Berlin... Because option, range, prices etc were updated, and here the availability went from ""starting production is expected for LATE 2021“ to just ""starting production is expected for 2021""."
"Where do you see the power folding? Under the All Black interior it states “2nd row seats that fold flat” and under the Black and White interior it states “Three independently folding 2nd row seats”

Edit: on the main Model Y page it states “each second row seat folds flat independently” and has a picture of the all black interior. Must not be fully updated."
"Not sure they are not powered, but it looks like fold individually only in the white interior."
"THere were a few options that went up with the AWD debut, but they all eventually came down in price, but that was likely due to the slow phase out of the Fed Tax Credit."
I heard from the Tesla store in Gothenburg that the european version of model Y will be built in gigafactory 4 in germany. If everything goes smoothly. So no european versions from the freemont factory.
It most certainly changed if you made any changes and prices of certain options increased. For example when the Model Y increased 1K dollars and people made changes their price reflected the increase in 1k ontop of any changes they made
My order updated automatically. It’s now $5k cheaper. Nice!
"login to [tesla.com](https://tesla.com), pull up your reservation, and update your configuration and you'll definitely get the lower price."
Semi then Roadster then CT. It's going to be a bit.
"- Roof is all glass vs Bar across the center in M3
- 10% bigger 
- ~63 cu ft of cargo capacity vs ~43 cu ft in M3 
- Less range"
One would assume?
Where do you see that?
Model 3 charge faster than the other Tesla models. I really hope the Model Y charges faster than Model 3. I've heard on 120v outlet the M3 can get 5 miles an hour. If the MY gets 6 miles an hour I'll be elated :)
That is the exact config I want asthetically
Oh whoops I just realized I was looking at the Canadian website with Canadian dollars so the car seemed more expensive than it was...
My local detail shop did the chrome delete for like 300 bucks on my S over 2 years ago. Well worth it.
FSD is linked to the car.
Unfortunately FSD lives on the car :/
The 2500 will definitely be knocked off the price. I had read the terms before I had put it down as well. The wheels Im not sure of but Im sure they'll deduct it as well.
[deleted]
Newer tech at an expense of space (if you are considering 2016 or 2017 models).
I respect that.
Not (yet) in Canada!
I wonder what this means for me and others who have a LR RWD on order from the launch event. Will we be given dual motor AWD at no extra cost? I guess I should open up a chat and see
The online chat still exists? Can you send a link please.
"Would I still get original 19"" sport wheels I pre-ordered?"
Can you do the same but with blue?
It was 2500 before for the Y to. I had put 2500 down already
A penis mostly.
Size and features
"The Model Y is to the Model X like the Model 3 is to the Model S. It's cheaper, a bit smaller, and specs are a bit less impressive. People are very excited about the model Y because SUV crossovers are by far the best selling car class and the model Y is affordable and impressive."
Brah.
"This is the same situation with the model 3, they produce the highest trim versions first then sell lower cost options later, model 3 was 55-65k when it was first rolling out."
$37k
I’m pretty sure you get the miles. It’s kind of like a gift for ordering early
"No. By 2023, you can just order and it’ll be delivered in a matter of weeks."
"That's the only thing that has kept me from putting in a  reservation. Being an early adopter can be fun, but also painful."
"I hear you, man.  I stood line for hours to preorder the Model 3 back in 2016.  I ended up cancelling my order because I was seriously underwhelmed with the first one I drove by renting from Turo.  Those early production cars were LR RWD, and had plenty of issues.  No way I could justify that insane price either.  So I cancelled.  By the spring of 2019, when the SR+ first came to showrooms, I was interested again and by that time they had plenty of inventory AWD ones in stock.  Picked up white/white LR AWD with AP for $46k, which was a $6k discount off MSRP at the time."
"I’m surprised they’re pushing 315 miles of range with the Gemini’s. Too bad they don’t have the aero still, a little bummed about that one."
[deleted]
He said on the earnings call they've been working on the core infrastructure a lot more. Hoping to get it out in the next couple months.
Because all versions of the Model Y are $5000 more because its a crossover. It's the same as the S to the X
"Its 5000 more because its larger and more family friendly. Its probably not worth 5000 unless you want a performance mini-SUV.

Reasons to not choose the performance upgrade: range, 21"" wheels with harsher ride, more expensive, faster wearing tires with less sidewall so they are more likely to get curbed."
We are getting the Y with the expectation it'll be a bit roomier. Other replies covered the reasons for wanting the smaller tires.
315
"Might be because the overall tyre diameter is now bigger than the Model 3. (haven't seen pictures yet.)  I would prefer 18"" wheels and taller side wall.  That said, the 18s on my model 3 give a much better ride than i was expecting."
okboomer
"most people haven't used a CD in 10 years.

raise the MSRP $50.00 just to add a CD player.. fuck off."
I paid 250k for a house and it came without a gramophone.
CD player? People still use this?
"It’s not new, and you can have one axle spinning freely while the other pulls the load."
"Very happy about that lol. Just hoping Model Y can relatively match the popularity of the Model 3. I have doubts since (if I recall correctly) the Model X only sells slightly more than the Model S, despite SUVs in the broader market doubling sales of sedans."
"Please let it go down for just abit, so we can all buy more."
Never watch stocks live - it's like trying to decode the matrix
"if i do that ill realistically will eat cardboard for the next years in order to get by.

The prices need to come down a ton till the average person can afford it."
That’s the plan. But I’m starting to realize how afraid I am with leaving my car in a parking lot. I am not in California but there are kids everywhere that just dings or rubs against my car when I’m outside. Getting a Roadster would quadruple my fear and become paranoid. I think I’ll just upgrade to an S when that gets updated
Yes indeedy....
Tell me about it. Waiting for any model 3 to hit under 30k 😪
same here but will be for my son turning 16yo 1 year from now
Same here. Cybertruck for me!
That's the plan! Lol
"The difference between the S and X isn't that dramatic on the street, i doubt it'll be that much different for the 3 vs the Y. My next Tesla will probably be a Y"
Yeah it would be nice to have a bit more room but not a big deal. Plus I think they'll be very similar in terms of fun factor
"3 months maybe, 2 months probably"
New decade
"New Decade, new ElonTime ™
😉"
"He's growing at an exponential rate. This is slower than linear, but only at first."
Much better than Valve time.
I wish the new Elon time applied to starship/superheavy
Maybe there was some sort of time zone error with Mars ElonTime™?
Underpromise and overdeliver.
"https://youtu.be/8xRqXYsksFg

Wisdom of a great man."
So different universe then ;)
"Ah. My 35k model 3 ""SR"", begs to differ. But to be fair they cancelled that model and upgraded all of us to SR+ for ""free"". But the website said 6-8 weeks and from order day to delivery was 12-14 weeks."
where can you see the estimated production time?
What Cybertruck did you order?
"Performance with 19"" wheels is same range as AWD."
"I have to admit. I used to love big wheels. But dealing with sub par range (probably 15 percent range loss compared to aero), and my wife last week who hit the curb and messed up the suspension and tires.. I’m kind of changing my mind on that."
Performance shows as 315 now...maybe they hadn't updated it yet - check again.
"Listening to the earnings call, they're saying that it says 280 because they haven't updated the numbers yet..."
Only weird thing is the performance pack is the same price as non-performance pack which is pretty weird. I guess they're hoping for a few folks who really want the extra miles to cough up $8000 for mostly software.
I got an old 2009 Lexus SUV..gonna trade that towards the Y. Can't wait to never visit a gas station again and throw away $50+ every week.
You do! Teslas exist now!
The reason is the model Y ;-)
"My wife has a mustang and is newly pregnant.  Figure we have about a year left on it, which would be the point at which infant car seats are no longer usable.  I can’t even imagine how un fun it is to strap a baby into a rear facing car seat in a two door car."
"I actually paid the $1500 more for the 19"" sport wheels in my order on the reveal night. I am curious what they're going to do - give me the 19"" sport wheels, or the 19"" gemini wheels or give me the 20"" induction wheels.

My order details still show the 19"" sport wheels."
"I have no idea what to expect, but I would love those 19"" wheels. Seems like it would make sense so they wouldn't have to order unrelated parts to fulfill a handful of preorders. 
Not sure how my RWD + 3rd row order will be handled 🤷‍♂️"
"Even though I paid for the upgraded 19” wheels, I’d have to pay another $2000 to edit my order and change to the upgraded 20” wheels. They have to have some sort of process to keep us at our somewhat locked in price. I think the difference is $500?"
Yeeesssss! Finally delivered on the black rims! Love them.
21” which may be a pain when shopping for tires.  Pretty much limits to summer only tires.
I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say the new wheels are part of the increased efficiency they’ve been able to achieve with the Model Y since reveal. I’m guessing there won’t be a range penalty for the new 19s over the old 18s.
"Hey, just curious, how does rim size affect range?"
"Yes. The base price of the AWD has gone up from $52,000 to $52,990"
"What happened to the RWD? Are they not doing it anymore, or is it going to be produced later?"
I hope so!
Nope. My order page now shows the 19” wheels. All good
Depends on if it has FSD mostly. Between 44-47k
I kinda wish more American cars did a pass through.
"I’m sad about that, personally. Hopefully the 18s will still actually fit even if you can’t order with them."
Yes but for the full price of the regular performance upgrades. Might as well take all the upgrades since it's no additional cost
"It's literally listed on the website as ""performance upgrade, optional"". I'm quoting them. Appreciate the lecture though."
They have killed rwd and brought it back before. Just a matter of how much battery supply is limited vs increased profit margin on the awd models.
"Still available in German website. Did they only update the US website?

Performance values are also different. The german website also says production starts in 2022 for standard range models, 2021 for everything else."
"I was just telling my wife today, I wish they had a cheaper FWD option. It would be perfect for us Canucks in the snow. When I don't need to take my 4x4 out, our little cars with FWD, good tires, and sand bags in the back have always done well. Plus we are already satisfied with our Chevy Sonic's acceleration, so a single FWD motor would still be a massive upgrade."
"Yeah this is all confusing. I had a 7 seat performance teed up...and now you can’t even configure with 7 seats. Also the $100 preorder fee is just a hair less than $2,500. Do we get priority? Refund?"
"I also ordered the LR AWD with 18"" wheels.  When I look at my order now it lists 19"" Gemini wheels.  No mention of range, but I'm assuming it's going to be 315, because the order simply says ""Long Range All-Wheel Drive"" and LR AWD range is now shown as 315 miles everywhere else."
AFAIK nothing is locked in until you sign the MVPA
"Model 3 AWD is already 322mi, but yeah it seems like 8 miles range loss for a bigger car is not a bad trade off. I also remember reading that Model Y has the same 0.23cd drag coefficient as Model 3. Maybe with improved manufacturing techniques used in the Model Y the weight is not too different from the Model 3 and that is why the range is pretty close."
"Model 3 awd was lower range than rwd. I think this is because the motor on rwd was already the more efficient permanent magnet motor, and they added a less efficient induction motor. When model S got awd, they had an induction motor and added another induction motor that was more efficient under certain circumstances"
"Model 3 LR RWD was 325 miles. (now would probably be like 335 miles)

Model 3 LR AWD was 310 miles (now 322 miles)

Then SR was 220 miles while the SR+ was 240 miles (now 250 miles) and the MR was like 260 miles or something but also came with fully premium interior..."
"$50,000 more, for same features on Model X :-( Can't afford that."
I’m kinda hoping they do an extended wheelbase variant for the 7 seater. Like maybe they can build it in China since the Chinese love extended wheelbases anyway.
Wait... If/when you order it charges 100 that doesn't go toward the price of the car? Surely that can't be right.
Not sure if it's comparable but my $100 solar ordering fee this fall was refunded to my credit card after installation.
"Unless they changed this super recently that’s not correct.
My $100 went towards the purchase price of my M3, delivered last December."
"Hrrrm… that's unfortunate.  Well, I'm sure someone will be testing to see if they're installable well before it becomes an issue for me."
Sounds like a great idea! I was supposed to do that this week...
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think LR RWD is available for Model 3, even off-menu. I think only SR is available off-menu."
"Hopefully at the same price! That's a bigger concern.

I assume they'll focus on AWD until later this year and open up RWD."
"How do you order something ""off menu""?"
"Yeah, but that's not worth 5k to me.

I have a RWD 3 and have had fairly even wear despite spirited driving.

My wife is even more feather footed so I imagine wear won't be a huge enough issue."
"They aren't cross delivering. All US sold will be delivered from Fremont and all China sold will be from China factory. This removes the overseas shipping, Berlin, etc. Wonder if that means reduction in price when they stop shipping from US to the world"
"Huh, You're right, it's on the 3 configurator for the performance upgrade. I guess I just assumed it was on the Y too. I wonder if that means that won't be an option at all for the Y?"
You order the performance without selecting the performance upgrade “select option”
"just dont select the performance upgrade. But you dont save any money (stealth and fully upgraded is the same price), which is pretty ridiculous"
Just don't pick the optional performance upgrades
Take your up doot.
"The euro model 3's have a tow package.  Gives you a tow hitch.

We need this badly in the US."
The option to tow.
"In the earnings call, Tesla said they have already begun production ramp up, so hopefully it's faster than the 3!"
We can’t transfer the $100 correct? Have to cancel and reorder? Can’t get a hold of someone via the phone and sales rep at a store said I had to cancel.
"Same... I mean I'm willing to wait it out, but would just like to have a definite timeline.
If we get it in may/June 2020 I'd be happy. I was expecting like January 2021"
"Yeah same, plus essentially giving them an interest-free loan for nothing"
"I'm wondering if they'll deliver the rwd this year, but I wish they'd just give guidance on timing so we can make informed decisions"
"I had AP, RWD, and 3rd row seats. Not sure what to expect! Hopefully we know more in a few hours. I'd imagine they send us AWD but software limit it to RWD"
I don’t know anymore
Found another angle. 19s are Goodyear Eagle Touring and 20s are Goodyear Eagle F1s
They should
"Love my P3D-.  All the power, none of the the giant wheels or lowered car.  Not a good idea in Texas."
I think the y will have more sidewall and be wider than the 3. 20s should be fine
Why? Genuinely curious
Wish I had 3 Tesla’s lol
"Who knows? That’s certainly not something I’d entertain doing though. 

More realistically I’ll buy a Cybertruck or wait for used model X prices to come down. I was on the fence about model Y anyway because I need something for 3 kids."
"Maybe I have it wrong but wouldn’t the MSRP for a model Y 7 seater now be $55,990? The extra $3k for seven seats would be added to $52,990 to get to the MSRP for the product, right?"
"Looks like the checkbox is free.  You have to pay 8K to get that checkbox to appear though, so..."
Hoping they will add heated steering wheel down the road a bit. Also I don’t want first production again.
">	I would really also like them to allow moving FSD to this car as an EAP+FSD Model 3 owner who literally has not gotten any benefit from FSD. Feels idiotic to trade in a car with a feature I never received and not get any more money for the trade but have to pay for FSD all over.

Wishful thinking :(

I’d put in my order right now if they’d allow that."
Yea. We ordered recently. So got AP included.   It's showing.
Yeah but they’re perfect for kids with car seats l/boosters.  That way the adults in the back aren’t cramped with a giant car seat next to them.
"Enough spaces for two children to be comfortable. I think that's the only suitable use case, but that's fine for a lot of people."
"Not as nice looking as the previous 19"""
"I believe it did, but I ultimately changed the wheels so I am not entirely sure."
"Checked my order and saw the 19” sport was replaced with the 19” Gemini. Plus, the price went up a bit, so I’d guess that’s where the money went."
Trading... Seats? Dash?
"I got children too, but even 10 year olds would be cramped back there."
"ya that's probably it, they're still in the process of updating"
I think that’s a gimmick to try to get people to upgrade to the white interior.  My bet is the black interior will still have the same feature
Kinda regret changing it now. I had just assumed prices went up in general by $990 regardless of new or preorder.
would this effect my delivery date?
UGGGGHHHHHHHHHH :-P
Thanks
This is what I been looking for.  Thank you
"It was under Range at the respective product pages. However, after double-checking the difference seems to be there only at the localized Danish website. On the US site, they both state 158 miles per 15 mins."
"Model 3 gets the most miles per kWh mainly because it's the lightest vehicle in the fleet. Model Y is essentially a slightly heavier 3, so it will get slightly less range per hour on any specific household circuit."
I have an all black in and out Model 3. Figured I’d switch it up a bit.
How has it held up? I'd be worried about an edge lifting after a few power washes.
I also ordered a black one before white was the free color are they now going to charge me for the black?
Funny we don't know this but we have reliable sources on the TP situation in the restrooms.
Lol I doubt you will get upgrade like that for free. Most likely delivery at a later time similar to Model 3 when dual motors were priority.
"...

Reluctant upboat."
"In the grand scheme of things, a $52k vehicle ( possibly 45k after rebates and such) is not an affordable vehicle for the masses.  Especially when it is still a 5 seater for most people of average height and weight. 

Affordable would be the M3 or even the Cybertruck (which is a comfortable 6 seater at base price) that supposedly starts at 39k, before rebates and incentives. 

Hence why I don't think the Y will pick up as much traction as Tesla thinks it will. If anything, The Cybertruck may be the *real* star of Tesla, especially if they keep the starting price at $39k while keeping the specs as impressive as they are."
Not realy. An x trail is affordable. 32k 42k starting is not afordable
"but its just the long range variante for nearly 60k only downgrades would be standard range with partial premium interior.

still gonna be like 50k for the base model."
But I could lock down the FSD price
says someone who has likely never worked in automotive manufacturing. I legit laughed at this when I read it.
I didn’t realize this with the S/X.  Thanks!
"I have a Performance Y on order but am confused about what Tesla is doing with the pricing.  I was interested in the Stealth 3 because it gave you the acceleration without paying for the unnecessary bells and whistles and I was worried about the big rims with potholes.  Now, if you want the acceleration, you basically have to pay for those bells and whistles (big rims, spoiler, aluminum pedals, performance brakes, etc.) whether or not you actually want them.  Tesla is communicating that these items have no value."
You paid too much.
"> the Model X only sells slightly more than the Model S, despite SUVs in the broader market doubling sales of sedans.

Just my opinion, but I'd think the price of the Model X has something to do with this. It's not affordable for most of the population. But with something like the Model Y is a *bit more closer* to people's price points"
Tesla sold 36% more Xs than Ss in the US in 2019 FWIW. And there are a decent number of people who are turned off by the falcon doors.  I think the Y will likely double up sales of the 3 once people start to learn about it. It definitely doesn't have 3-level hype among the general public just yet.
"The “crossover utility vehicle” (what the model Y is) market is absolutely exploding. The Premium CUV class (exactly this price range) has some of the most room to grow. If Tesla has manageable production hell... I’d bet a share of stock that the Model Y sells at least 50% of the volume of the Model 3 in the US alone by Q4 2021.


https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/premium-cuvs-poised-for-sales-growth-in-us.html"
X and S are in a totally diff market.
"Doubt it will compete with the m3, as its almost double the price"
"With respect to Model S vs X and 3 vs Y:  Model X buyers were people that wanted to buy an EV, and represented the subset of the population that wanted an SUV form factor rather than a sedan and cold afford it.  Potential Model Y buyers, OTOH, are crossover/compact SUV buyers that hadn't previously considered an EV, but based on the positive news they hear from their friends and family about the Model 3 are now going to consider a purchase of one (not necessarily because it's electric).  Get their butts into the seat and it will be a done deal.  It will fly off the lots (well, virtually since there won't be any lots with Model Y's just sitting around!)"
Damn it. Now I might get the model y instead of the cybertruck.
Oh no I dont fuck with the numbers. I already had the stock and was looking at the graph go
"I am not a truck guy, nor do I find the cyber truck to be practical with its size... but it seriously makes me question whether I should go for it Value-wise over the Y. 

My timetable isn’t for quite awhile (3-4 years likely) so things will obviously change for both Tesla and myself. I’m big into motorcycles so I’ve thought maybe the truck will have to be my purchase!"
"During the fourth quarter earnings call, they said that it was going to be way more than the 10% difference between the 3 and the Y, throughout the vehicle (I believe they specifically said when they tear it down, they'll see the significant difference)"
GNISREVER
We switched universes over Chinese New Year.
Practice makes perfect 😊
So you think they'll convert my LR rear wheel to the AWD free too?
"They never said the SR would come out by a specific date. They said the model three will go on sale and it was earlier than they said originally. Also the SR isn't cancelled, you can still and could always get it."
"I also have the 35k SR version, but I believe they reduced the miles to 220 and there’s no autopilot, right?"
I will look it up but I saw it on the deposit form and it was moved up and I verified it with a friend who works for Tesla. I love my Tesla I originally had a Model s P90DL and now I have a Model X P100DL... Still patiently waiting for my hardware three update!
Don't you just want the Überturbine wheels just for the name? Sounds cool.
"Ah this fixes my only issue with the performance pack. 20"" is too much rim. 19"" is great! I don't see a ton of benefit in the performance upgrade now on top of the performance base trim."
"Hah! Sorry to hear that. Yeah, I love larger tire and less rubber. But I have the 18”s on my Model 3 with Aeros and it looks good. So I can live with the smaller on the Y. 

I’d rather take the range 👍🏼"
Performance with the upgrades package is 280
A lot of people want the acceleration of a Performance model but aren’t interested in huge wheels or reduced range.  They will upsell a ton of Y buyers to Performances without the upgrade package if they know they won’t lose range or have to deal with the 21”s
"Well right now my commute is one trip 100 miles a month and probably 2-3 10 miles. RT

But if/when my job changes and I have to drive more...

I have gotten used to not having a car payment however. That'd be tough to bring back."
Assuming its an RX you can probably get a few grand private party. Had a 09 Rx with about 80K mi before getting an X. Sold for 10K.
Trade in? Maybe you should sell it to one of us . I can’t afford two Teslas :)
Enjoy the $800 they offer you lol
"You could probably get a better return hanging on to it and selling it as a private seller. Trade-ins are way undervalued by companies and dealers that tkae trade ins.

Tesla uses Kelley Blue Book's approx trade-in value estimate, so check that out (pick ""Good"" for condition, I think Tesla uses that for all) and then compare it to KBB's estimated cost for private sale of your vehicle."
Maybe when they are out and about...assuming I have a new job / reason to commute.
My dad sold his Scirocco after trying to fit my older brothers car seat into the back a couple times.
"My order changed to the 20"" Induction rims since I had the sports on preorder and for $500 cheaper keeping the previous upgrade price.  It's 2k to upgrade now."
I checked again now.. I got upgraded to the induction wheels now :)
My order changed to gemini
"I did just notice that my original order (via email) specifically mentions the 18"" wheels, but if I go to tesla's site and look at my reservation there is no mention of any wheels. If I'm remembering correctly, I think it used to match what the email had with the 18"" wheels.

UPDATE: mine has change to 19’’ Gemini Wheels now."
Yes I wonder if our rear wheels become AWD for free?
"I just asked them chat support team about this but didn't get a helpful response: 

""I cannot look into this further because we are still a bit away from delivery for the Model Y as of yet, but when we get closer, you will be contacted and review your order!"""
"I believe it's mostly aerodynamics. The 18"" wheels were very flat and thus less drag than the new options"
You are slinging around a lot more mass. Plus the tire options for a 21” rim are limited to summer tires mostly which favor grip over rolling resistance.
Probably delayed production.
No FSD unfortunately
whats fsd?
"Just because you drink the kool aid doesn't mean you're right. Do you immediately believe everything exactly as you're told? Think for yourself. Perhaps you need a lecture from an economist to get it to sink in.

For the record the only reason I'm on your case is because this spin is a disservice to the public. Unless of course you are a shill then this makes sense."
I think the long rage AWD is gonna be selling out their supply for a long time even if they boost production.
When did they bring back RWD?
Gone on the Canadian site
Have you driven a RWD Tesla in the snow?  I hear they're pretty good with the even weight distribution.
"That's only because the engine is over the drive wheels, not true in a Tesla. RWD is better because you have two wheels to push and two to steer instead of just 2 to do it all"
"7 seats is still a thing, it just isn't available until next year.  They probably disabled the option to avoid a bunch of orders they aren't planning to fulfill anytime soon."
I would imagine you get priority because you pre-ordered before the $100 people
You'll probably need to reconfigure and you probably won't get priority. It'll probably be geographic like last time.
"That can't be true. Not like you can order a red performance and they show up with a black SR and go ""well here is your car""."
"> Model Y has the same 0.23cd drag coefficient as Model 3

To find the actual drag, you multiply the coefficient by the cross-sectional area of the car.  With an identical coefficient, the Y would have higher drag just because it's taller (and maybe wider)."
"> Model 3 awd was lower range than rwd. I think this is because the motor on rwd was already the more efficient permanent magnet motor, and they added a less efficient induction motor.

Man... why didn't they add a smaller permanent magnet motor instead? 

Could've gotten the obviously better driving characteristics and (maybe) not affected range"
How do I get 322 miles? 🤔 Mine is still 310.
Closer in price used.
I’m really hoping for this too. To give a few extra much needed inches to the third row would be amazing. I’m hoping they are still working on the design.
"Check under ""Due Today"" on the final page, it says ""Non-refundable Order Fee"".  My thoughts exactly when I got my 3 in November when they first changed to this system.  Final invoice had a line item for the $100 which was not deducted.  Wording has changed to ""fee"" from ""deposit"""
"They’re refundable, credits to the car if it’s purchased."
"Try check again, my final pricing (took delivery in Nov) has the order fee payment, but there was also a line item for it so it's not applied to the price.  I've also read the order agreements and nowhere it says it's applied to purchase price like how the $2500 pre order payment said it did.  It actually says once the process of matching begins, you agree that the order fee has been earned.  If you take a look at the Cybertruck pre order agreement, it says the $100 pre order payment is applied as a credit at delivery.

If you really did get the $100, that's great, but I really don't think it's like that going forward."
"It does seem like the Model Y 19"" wheels have more sidewall than the Model 3, so it might not be a big issue. That would also mean the overall wheel+tire diameter is larger on the Y.

I'm sure T-Sportline etc. will have aftermarket options in the near future as well."
In December they had several in the Chicago area for sale.
It’s still available as of Dec 2019. I ultimately didn’t pull the trigger but had at least 3 from my sales adviser I was considering before I decided on waiting for the Y. Texas.
"I was meaning I think they will want to deliver some Model Y to other LHD markets this year (China and Europe), and they are not going make any Model Y at GigaShanghai until the very end of this year, so overseas shipping logistics are going to impact delivery volumes."
"what.... this is the weird opposite of what every other manufacturer does. Pay for exterior & maybe suspension, but not a faster car.  

audi s-line but not s, bmw m but not m, lexus f, etc...

&#x200B;

Pay full price for performance model, but take away everything that signifies that it's the performance model... what..."
That’s why I’m confused. Do you call to update the price??
But the price doesn’t go down...hence not a true Stealth upgrade.
"If it’s just a hitch and no other physical or software changes I still don’t see how that’s really any different than other cars, which is why I asked about the “package”. 

Most sedans don’t have tow hitches from the factory, they are sold and produced by 3rd parties. For example, my last car (an Acura) had no listed towing capacity in the United States where some Acura/Honda models that are sold in Europe do. It didn’t stop me from installing a hitch and trailer harness and towing my [sea-doo](https://i.imgur.com/yJbIWog.jpg). 

If the “towing package” is just a bracket, I guess I don’t see all the fuss given that’s how other cars are as well."
The fact that you can't even order RWD says something - I wouldn't be surprised if they never see the light of day.  Think they may be waiting on an Elon-approved communication for those of us who reserved and Y possibly becoming an AWD-only model.
"Huh, now that's something I hadn't thought of. A software limited AWD to act as RWD. I'd take it!"
That’s definitely a possibility. I had ordered mine before AP became standard so I’m hoping they’ll include it for me. I never changed it due the price increase on the Model Y either so let’s see. My totals sitting at 48.5k on LR RWD Model
"As someone who has been vigariously looking at pricing, I don't think it has changed."
"You hit a pothole wrong, crack a wheel, and have to pay a few hundred bucks to replace. 

Learned this the hard way on our BMW. Had 19s with a small sidewall for the longest time. They looked great but couldn't handle Houston and Kansas City roads. Went to 18s with a higher sidewall and haven't had an issue since."
"Exactly what he said. Got my first ever 20s on my 2018 BMW 540, the individual series wheels from BMW.

Here is the lovely waste of time they have provided.

In about 1.5 years of ownership so far 

- 7 new tires (6 from sidewall bubbles, 1 split side wall)
- 5 bent wheels fixed

Boy am I glad I prepaid with the wheel and tire insurance  package for $3,500 up front. I’m definitely going to get my worth out of that. 

They look sexy as hell, but I avoid potholes like it’s my job in Jersey and still get my time wasted getting all these things fixed by going back to the dealer. My time is more valuable than dealing with this to enjoy sexy wheels IMO. Bring on the smaller wheels, bigger tire side walls, and more time not being back at the dealer.

"Do you know why I got voted down? Was it the potty mouth? Some folks missed my humor/explanation and thought I really was chastising you? I don't care so much, have karma to spare, it's just odd."
I believe that is considered an option. My configuration is just over the $55 price point (due to options) and still shows the $5k credit.
"First production will not be a massive deal with how much is shared with model 3. There still may be a few small isues, but I don't see them being that large of a deal. 

Also don't expect the heated steering wheel in the 3/Y, that's one of the few differentiating features the S/X have over them, it doesn't make sense for it to trickle down."
Hopefully they’ll add standard AP to mine soon. They changed the wheels already so hopefully slowly it’ll show AP
I'll bet a carseat doesnt fit back there- it barely fits in the backseat of a model 3 right now
But it’s aero. I like it more.
"Oh man, I think you had to keep the configuration.  Mine updated to the 20"" inductions.  Still at 53.5k for LR AWD with sport wheels."
That makes no sense cause I’m guessing the Aeros will be Gemini’s
...Dash lol. What a pita to change out seats?!
"Check it out, these guys traded dashes in a few mins: https://youtu.be/I_oYyuWbXbQ"
"I'm wondering the same thing. If you find out, let me know please!"
"If you're in europe, the Honda E will be available soon.

Has cameras for mirrors just like CT...so, pretty much the same vehicle :)"
"Never had an issue. I hand wash the summer, but use power spray car washes in winter to remove the salt. Just never wanna get too close though with power washers."
"It's safe to assume that you'll

- get the upgraded wheels for free

- get either black or white paint for free

- pay the same price as it'd currently cost you (or less if your order was cheaper than it'd be today)

If not, then you would obviously cancel your order and reorder one. That's why they would be more than willing to give you those things.."
I understand I probably won’t but the agreement I have with Tesla for when I placed the order says delivery in later 2020 so hopefully they don’t push it back considering even during the event LR RWD was said to be a 2020 delivery
"In its class, I call both model 3 and model Y affordable; but to somebody who doesn’t know whether they can buy food next week, neither is."
When you factor in gas and maintenance over 7 years the x trail doesn't look so affordable... And the Tesla has far better performance.
"Fair point. Wonder how long you can defer delivery for, though."
You get the same acceleration with the Stealth Y. Check the site.
249970 would have been a fair price!
Also maybe the quirkinesses of the falcon wings. I love the look but my wife hates them. And they just aren’t practical in our small garage.
not only affordable but easier to make compared to the model x and plus it shares parts with the model 3 :D no brainer!
"It's not that much more expensive than the comparison point, Model S. And SUVs across the industry are a bit more expensive than sedans, yet they sell way more units."
$50k is still a big boy price though. I’m surprised they’re not pushing an entry level $40k model y and a $35k model 3. Maybe in a year.
"Wow, that's a big difference. The price delta isn't exactly insignificant either"
"True, but how come Model X doesn't sell double what Model S does? Whatever that reason is, it might apply to Model Y as well. Or not. I hope not, but who knows."
Model Y isn't much more expensive than Model 3...
You should buy a Zero then!  The SR/F is awesome!
"I am not a truck guy either, and Cybertruck would be my first truck. I am saving for the tri-motor one with 500+ miles range. It is expensive, but it will be very practical. This way I am not selling my model 3 prematurely and losing tones of money on that."
"Trying to decide between the model y and Cybertruck myself. Was also looking at the Mach e, but I want autopilot.  Model y is probably the better vehicle for me. But the Cybertruck stands out. It‘s like the modern DeLorean. Lol"
I'm talking more about the driving dynamics
We coronavirus now!
"Guten Tag, mein Name ist Sabine Überturbine."
"Performance pack is standard so it's might as well get it or just the regular AWD because it's a whole $8,000 jump from LR AWD to Model Y Performance."
Yeah but performance with the regular tires (default) is 315.  So you can get the acceleration without losing the mileage from adding the tires.
"Given that Tesla is still very much supply-constrained, deferring your purchase in favor of others with (likely) higher mileage rates is arguably the better option for the planet. 🙂"
"Good ol RX 350, yeah, i'll look into posting it etc."
"Yeah..might try to sell it to a private buyer before opting to trade it in to Tesla. I traded in an old Honda for my Model 3 back in 2018 and they gave me like $900..which is ya know, something."
"Same!

 https://imgur.com/CRMuf1R"
"Yeah, they just made this change in the last 20 or 30 minutes. Mine said 18 inch wheels about 30minutes ago (I took a screenshot), and now it doesn’t say they wheels at all. 

Thankfully the price is still showing the old amount.  I wonder if this means we’ll be lower priority than new orders which may have a sticker price $990 higher (plus they already have our $2,500 deposit in hand)"
"Oh weird! Same thing here except it also doesn't say ""Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive"" but my email does..."
Mine still says 18 aero wheels
That's the dream 😎

"I don't think so, but I can't remember. If I did it wasn't for any significant distance, as I usually only pull them from my lift back out to the parking lot. Once I did some donuts in the parking lot but that was at the request of the customer after having smoked a cement island. I performed an inspection and a few simple checks and deemed it fine, but they asked me to do some higher speed figure eights in our parking lot and I mean..... who is going to say no to a customer asking you to thrash their car? I was gentle, but did just enough to make them feel confident in their car again :)"
"They're good for RWD, but not fantastic. Weight distribution isn't a huge part of it (we're talking 60/40 vs 50/50, it's fairly close). RWD is still not particularly optimal and FWD would be better for most people."
With snow tires RWD is fine
"It makes sense as the engine is not over the front axle, thus wouldn't receive the added benefit of the increased traction."
That would be foolish as that would give them data to determine popularity.
Don't assume. It was not the case for the Model 3. Many pre-ordered M3s were delivered later than those ordered once it was open up to general ordering.
"Unfortunately, Tesla might fill the $100 fee orders first since: 1) the purchase price is $990 higher, and 2) they will take in $2500 more in cash when they deliver to those customers instead of preorder customers"
"I mean pricing and config wise, this is what I've experienced when I ordered my car. It's been almost 2 years though so it might have changed since though."
Pretty sure they selected the 2 different architectures because they shined at different places on the N-T (RPM-Torque) maps.
"With full FSD, I haven't seen it for any less than 90k used :-("
"The $100 order fee says non-refundable, actually"
"I triple checked my financial docs and MVPA, it definitely was included into the down payment portion."
"Yeah I was mostly just hoping I could keep my winter wheel and tire set for my 3 and use em on the Y. Plus I hate form over function, which is what big wheels tend to be."
Brand new? With a new VIN? Could have been damaged cars that just got finished being repaired if they weren't a high VIN.
So it was inventory cars and not new ones? Trying to figure out if they're still producing them.
"nope, thats just Tesla saying ""if you dont want the upgrades, then you can take the faster acceleration but pay the same price""

hopefully they change this, those upgrades should cost an additional 4-5k but subtract that if not selected"
"Oof, you're right.  I stand corrected"
"There is a software change, there's a tow mode added.

Here's a video of the hitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDEg9GdMe8c

You can go aftermarket, but I'd really really prefer to have everything done in a tested manner and under warranty."
"They changed the rear subframe for the tow package in Europe. But apparently in the us that leads to crash testing issues where they’d have to recrash and certify the variants.

I am kind of surprised the Y doesn’t default to a tow package."
"I can confirm that in the last hour my Model Y RWD 7-seat preorder from earlier this month now shows the 19-inch Gemini wheels. For the few hours prior it removed the wheel listing entirely. Still doesn't match my email, as my email lists RWD but the website just doesn't show the option."
So you’re saying I should get the 21’s?
What’s the aspect ratio on your tires? 30%?
That sucks. My BMW has the 21” rims and never had a problem. Also had two cars prior with 20” rims and the only tire related issue has been a nail.
Well I certainly hope you’re right!
Yeah..... no.
"Eh, well, I don’t really need a new car for another 12-18 months, or whenever I run out of warranty.   Either way I’d like to benefit from the inevitable changes after the first year or so of production. 

I’ve given up on hoping they’ll give us better seats but not offering a heated steering wheel, which even shameboxes like the Leaf have, is so sad."
"I mean... I have a model 3... and a car seat fits in my backseat pretty comfortably, so...

But I guess we will see, I'm sure one of my friends will get one before me and I'll test it with a car seat before buying."
"Well, whatever, it’s not that much of a difference in the grand scheme of things."
"I would’ve thought so, but whatever, regardless of what they say, I feel Tesla can just change the rules as they go along until they ship the car, so I just changed the config to what I wanted."
That's awesome!!!
"That's an extremely out of touch view of what's considered affordable.  😂

Not everyone who isn't struggling can just afford to purchase a $45-50k vehicle on a whim. Hence why the model 3 was so successful. 

Like, what is wrong with you people ? Who is sitting here believing a $50k vehicle is *affordable* and if you can't afford it, you're probably struggling to put food on the table ???  That's just so obnoxious."
Yea 3 years is a bit extreme but hey🤷🏽‍♂️
"Yes, and the stealth costs the same as the performance upgrade, meaning that the brakes, etc. have no value."
"If you paid more than $100.00 per square foot, you paid too much."
"You may know this , but the falcon wings do not require much clearance at all. I believe  it is only 11” required."
"Not to state the obvious but the model S isn't exactly cheap.  Obviously it's a technological marvel and I consider it a piece of automotive history but that comes at a cost.  So on top of all that, the model X costs even more for a bit more space, higher ride, and crazy doors.

I think we'll see a ridiculous demand for the Y, well beyond the 3 and at a much wider margin than the X over the S."
"There were quite a few posts of ppl saying no to 3 bc no hatch. Given current market I can see Y AWD outselling 3 AWD, US at least."
"Huh, could be a europe thing? When i looked on the site a dtandard m3 was about 40k euros and the model y 65-70k"
"I go back and forth all the time. I think my motorcycles will remain gas powered because I LOVE the sounds and looks of them. Maybe when the SR/F isn’t like 25k! 

I bet the acceleration could make a grown man scream though..."
"Ah, then yep, probably just like ya said"
Coronaunivirus
*Chinavirus
"capital T, capital N... someone actually speaks German"
"I want the acceleration, I dont want 21"" wheels and am indifferent about the brakes and higher top speed."
You need the upgrades package for the speed though. Unless you’re talking about the acceleration.
Yeah I'm coming up on 5 years of ownership and almost 40k miles. However when I do the commute the 50 miles each way takes two hours which drops my MPG down to a healthy...16-18.
Don't feel bad.  Elon stole the Fremont factory from Toyota for some bottle caps and pocket lint.
...and now the 18” wheels are showing again in my order. Weird
"My order on the website still says Rear-Wheel Drive and 18"" Aeros, at least for now...

Edit: now says 19"" Gemini, still RWD"
Tip: don't buy a product that doesn't exist yet. Ever.
"I had a FWD Nissan Altima for a decade before owning my RWD Model 3 and the Model 3 handles better in the snow. 

The Altima, being the V6 version, also had a lot of torque steer at high RPMs which would give the steering a very mushy and floating feeling. That would probably be a big problem with the amount of torque in Tesla’s vehicles."
"That's what I thought. I have an '07 Ford Ranger 4x4, and when it's in 2WD the ass end swings out bloody everywhere. Meanwhile in our little Sonic with good winter tires, the ass end obviously doesn't swing out without the e-brake, as the front wheels just pull you wherever you want to go automagically. I would have thought Tesla would have saw more value in offering a FWD over RWD in the Model 3's, being as it was marketed as a family sedan."
I thought that depended on the trim
Where? Wasn’t the case on my Cybertruck.
Brand new late 2019 production date. One white model in Schaumburg the day I was there $46k and two red in Westmont.
"They weren’t available in October, and they had 3 available in December. I assume they were making them, but no idea if that has continued into this year. I would contact them in the next month or so and ask. Inventory should become available before end of Q1 if they are still making them."
Then it’s not a Stealth upgrade. Please clarify that post.
"Thanks, that’s what I wanted to know."
"Another commenter clarified it for me. There is a tow mode in software that disables much of the autopilot/etc hardware to keep it from freaking out. That’s what I was curious about, because otherwise I don’t see why couldn’t install a curt or draw-tite hitch like people do with many other cars."
Sounds like we are gunna be out of luck. Probably have to upgrade.
Only if you want your butt hole to pucker on every pot hole impact haha.
Not sure
Fair enough
"Yeah idk who downvoted my first reply up there, it's v much a possibility if you find someone to trade w"
"Isn’t that what I just said? There’s people who don’t know whether they can afford food, for them a $109 banger isn’t affordable?"
11” is too much for his wife. I don’t know firsthand but that’s what others on the reddit are saying.
Maybe it's about the height clearance in his garage. The doors do lift up quite a bit.
"I think it'll probably outsell it. I just don't know about to the same proportion that SUVs outsell sedans in the wider industry. Model X sales were disappointing close to Model S, and Model Y looks even more similar to Model 3 than Model X does to Model S, so its sales numbers might be even closer to its sedan counterpart."
"Are you comparing standard Model 3 to standard Model Y? I bet you're looking at the long range AWD Model Y, because the standard range one isn't available yet.

I just looked on the German site, and the LR AWD Model 3 is €54,090 while the LR AWD Model Y is €58,620."
"Premium is $21,500. It’s the fastest (acceleration) bike I’ve ridden. Go test ride one!  Where are you located?"
what do you mean? is the t in tag and the n in name regularly capitalized in written german?
"I’d imagine they would have an AWD+ upgrade much like the model 3, that way you can have more performance while making it worth it ($2k vs $8k)"
"Yeah I think most people are concerned with acceleration....let's be honest, how many of us are going to care about going 145 instead of 135?"
Must be talking about acceleration. The speed doesn't matter too much since it's just a difference between 145 mph and 155 mph. Most people won't even get up to 120.
"I can confirm that in the last hour my Model Y RWD 7-seat preorder from earlier this month now shows the 19-inch Gemini wheels. For the few hours prior it removed the wheel listing entirely. Still doesn't match my email, as my email lists RWD but the website just doesn't show the option."
"I heard that from someone else too, curious if they're updating them manually?"
"I can confirm that in the last hour my Model Y RWD 7-seat preorder from earlier this month now shows the 19-inch Gemini wheels. For the few hours prior it removed the wheel listing entirely. Still doesn't match my email, as my email lists RWD but the website just doesn't show the option."
Agreed.
"Pretty much everyone who ever achieves serious independent wealth bets a non-trivial amount of money on something that doesnt technically exist at the moment in time that they commit the money. Right now, Tesla is by far the best bet as first mover on FSD and the cost of getting in early is virtually negligible. If you have the income to spare a few gs and are purchasing a Tesla anyway, then not upgrading to FSD is borderline financially untenable. It cant be justified, NOT buying it. 


Refusing to ever put money down on a product that doesnt yet exist is by definition locking yourself out of countless opportunities. It may not happen on Musks timeline, but within 5 years conservatively, virtually everyone who didnt get FSD early when they had the chance will regret it and miss out financially because of it."
"If you had it for a decade, are you comparing an old vehicle without traction control to one with it? Then yes, the one with traction control _probably_ will do better, even if it's RWD.

Regarding torque steer, there's ways to minimise it, even as ""simple"" as having the drive shafts be the same length from side to side which Tesla does in fact do. One also does not experience torque steer in Winter driving conditions, so this was funny to put side by side but I get it haha"
"It’s way harder to get a RWD Model 3 sideways than it is in a Ford Ranger. The traction control corrects a fishtail very quickly. It’s incapable of doing doughnuts in a snow covered lot for this reason, without pulling the ABS sensor to disable traction control. 

I was actually a bit disappointed in how difficult it is to get the car sideways when playing around in a snow covered lot. It was much easier in my Nissan Altima, which was FWD."
"If you spec out an order, on the payment page at the end."
Different for the model Y for some reason.
Very interesting. Haven't heard anyone else mention brand new LR RWD 3's. They also still make SR S/X that pop up in inventory from time to time.
Oh I'm not interested in buying one lol. Just a bit curious.
I just got some PTSD puckering from remembering that feeling.
I would hope you could even buy the piece from Tesla?
"Sure, but I'm talking about the average middle class person in my original comment that was replying to the guy who said the Model Y was considered affordable.  So, perhaps I've misunderstood your point. 

The average middle class American would never purchase a Model Y. Even with all the incentives, it's just too much for so little. 

Which is why I suggested that the Cyber truck may actually overtake the Y in sales just because of its truly affordable price, size and specs. Plus, at least in America,  pickup trucks are one the best selling vehicles.

As I talk to other middle class millennials with kids or no kids, no one cares about the Y. Everyone has their eyes on the truck or the model 3."
I cannot refute this.
lol well played sir
Oh damn. I had a feeling that someone was going to go there.
"They stop automatically, but I get that the car isn’t for everyone.    I love my 2019 Model X."
"Aah mb then, just went to the site and it popped up at the 70k one"
"Lame part of the country. Missouri. I don’t think there’s any nearby but it’s been awhile since I looked at their bikes on their page. I’m glad to hear it’s 21k while although high, is better than I thought. Thanks!"
"Yes, all nouns are capitalized. It's not a difficult thing, but a hard habit to pick up if not an native speaker."
"The Model 3 Performance is also the same layout, only difference is the wheels. Aero wheels only for P3D and still the grey 21"" Performance wheels for P3D+"
"but those 21"" Überturbine wheels are sweet"
Mine now says LR RWD. Guess this means we will have to wait longer. Sucks preordering and knowing some new orders will be filled before yours.
You do you buddy. FSD will be a commodity at some point and I’m not convinced Tesla will be first.
I was very surprised. I went there looking for a used one and to ask for some info and the rep said she can’t discussed the used but had some new available. $46K doesn’t seem like a good deal but they do seem to be around.
Ah got ya!
The struggle is real.
"Right. I read somewhere it was ~$250, then sell the white one on eBay"
Try a Harley Livewire. Supposedly it's aptly named.
"21""?! Is that not ridiculous to anyone else? I can't imagine how much tires are gonna cost... and if a pothole would ruin them."
Who is going to be first when no other company has thousands of cars collecting data?
If I had one I would 100% do that.
Except it starts at 30k. And the SR/F out performs it in just about every way...from a company that’s been doing electric only since 2006. Harley is out of their league here.
"Whoever figures out the right approach. Work smarter, not harder."
"Regardless there has to be real life testing. And I'd say Tesla is working the smartest. Collect data from the cars on the road to run simulations, and they have hundreds of thousands of data points. Who is further ahead in the race?"
"For sure Tesla is ahead right now. But AlphaZero is a good example of how technology advances in jumps sometimes. Other companies have worked on chess engines for decades, and Google came up with a novel approach that destroys decades of work. Maybe Tesla will be the company to figure out FSD, but maybe a company we aren't even considering comes up with a genius solution to the problem that jumps all the work Tesla has done."
"I just don't understand why you think a company without functioning vehicles and gathering real data points would surpass a company actively working on FSD and even has FSD capabilities available to a consumer for $50k. Sure it's a possibility, but with that logic anything is possible. 

Facebook, Google, Uber have all done real testing. especially in Palo Alto. But these are on specific roads given approval to do testing on and they don't have hundreds let alone hundreds of thousands of cars providing data to feed the AI model.

Let's say one of these other tech companies says tomorrow they have a full functioning FSD vehicle that can be made and sold to the public with 0 driver intervention.... They still need to manufacturer and build these cars for the public. Which takes years. And what's the cost going to be? 

FSD software is the hardest part, but doesn't matter until it can be provided to the public. And still won't matter if it's only affordable by .001% of new car buyers."
">and even has FSD capabilities

People complain about the cameras fogging up in bad weather all the time. Tesla is nowhere near FSD. Just look at Summon in a parking lot for all the evidence you need that computers are struggling to make complex decisions in real-time the way a human does.

> gathering real data points

Waymo and Audi are both doing this already, I haven't bothered to look up more but I can guarantee you Tesla is not the only company collecting data. Rivian will be joining the club in the very near future."
"> I just don't understand why you think a company without functioning vehicles 

Would love to see where I claimed this, btw. I feel like you're looking for an argument just for the sake of arguing."
"“Regardless of the caveats, Elon Musk’s feat is impressive. He built a car company from scratch this century, and it is now worth more than any of the so-called Detroit-three auto makers at any point in history.”

👏 👏 👏"
"I'm not an investment banker so excuse my inaccuracies but Tesla is the most valuable car company in America for a good reason, and it's not just for ""future production and growth"" like most people parrot here.

It's also because they are a heavily vertically integrated tech company that does more than just cars, and their business encompasses many aspects which are normally outsourced to contractors and more.  Things like software, upholstery, electronics, manufacturing components, etc are usually outsourced to other companies but Tesla does much of it in-house.  Most valuable being the software and electronics, where Tesla excels and where we all know where the big money is (look at the Big 4 in Silicon Valley).  On top of that, they also have their solar and battery divisions, which can be worth several billion alone."
"It's going up because people—despite a long-time prevailing negative narrative—are waking up the fact that Tesla sells every car they can make (there is no demand issue). And they are rapidly building factories and churning out cars. And cash isn't an issue because the world is awash in capital looking for a productive home (and Tesla is cash flow positive anyway). And the other car companies, who many said would squash Tesla, are inept at making an electric car many people want.

The automakers, bless their hearts, after long denial finally decided in roughly late 2018 and 2019 to all admit that electric was the future of the industry, and that they would clobber Tesla. But then when it came time to execute they stumbled—either introducing unappealing cars or just not being able to actually launch anything.

So now people are waking up to electric cars being in their future and only seeing one company making ones they really like.

Tesla's up and running in China. They are getting ready to build a factory in Germany.

Holy shit—Tesla just Apple'd the car industry."
[deleted]
"The value has little to do with current production. The value is in future growth. At about 10x growth, we will see substantial slowing I suspect."
"Rather silly to just use nominal US dollars without adjusting to inflation. Pretty obvious that GM or Ford in Detroit's heyday was still more valuable when you correct for inflation.

Still, Tesla has obviously achieved a great deal though I don't think I'd want to buy in at these prices. Really rather regret my limit order for TSLA at $29.50 when the price was $30 though...tried to save 50 cents a share and it never executed then I kept saying it was too expensive. Doh."
Market cap isn't especially meaningful.

Hi it’s Europe. Can we buy Elon Musk from you? We could use some daring innovators.
🚀
r/thalassophobia
This is the way.
Sheesh... love the stock but... yowsa.
Ok it’s off topic but why aren’t there any dealerships in Michigan? Like there is a Tesla store in a mall but I don’t see any places where u can pick up your car in Michigan... I see people going to Ohio (I think) to pick up their new Tesla.
"Yea, just ignore that one car company that ya know, paved the way for the auto industry for the next 100+ years. Man the Tesla circle jerk is so strong."
Inflation!
Bow bow ohhh yeeaahhh
I should have just planned to buy a beater and put all the money into Tesla stock. But then I would have been afraid to sell it to buy a tesla.
You don't say. That stock price is going nuts!
Wait until they figure that it's not a car company.
Is Tesla the second highest valued car company in the world now? It sits at over $80 billion right now
"^(I think the present valuation is a bit high.) That said, as a shareholder, I'm not unhappy about it.  As of yesterday, I'm up about 100% on the initial purchase price of my current shares.  I think a lot of what's priced into the current valuation is based on the long term vision of Elon.  Typically share prices do have something to do with the future but a lot of times it's based on what's going to happen in the next quarter rather than a longer-term vision for the company.  But, given how well Elon has delivered on what he's promised I think Wall Street believes he can do it.  The guy said he's going to make reusable rockets that land automatically on a floating platform in the middle of the ocean, an insane statement, but he sure did it didn't he?  

The Detroit 3 have been bought and sold more times than a busted down used car because their financials are a busted down POS.  2 out of 3 have a string of bankruptcies behind them and of course, let's not forget the government bailout.  Only Ford survived bankruptcy the last time around because they borrowed a stack of cash before the market went south and they just about survived on the skin of their teeth.  All of them have survived based on shipping jobs overseas because cheap foreign labor is the only way for them to stay afloat.  Meanwhile, Tesla is investing huge in the US gigafactory.  Hell even VW, BMW, Mercedes, Subaru, Toyota and others are making cars in the US and the big 3 American companies can't even do that.  Yes, Tesla is shipping a lot less cars than anyone else at this point but there's way more on the roads every day and there are way more being shipped every single year.  Production will keep increasing and Tesla will keep dropping racks of cash building gigafactories in every single market they want to sell in to keep production local to delivery points."
Is Tesla still being subsidized by the government?
Can someone tell me why I shouldn't invest all of my (extra) money on TSLA (other than diversification)?
"There's a reason Elon Musk danced in Shanghai

Tesla's market cap is now bigger than Ford's at it Zenith.

Tesla's market capitalization has zoomed above $82 billion"
as it should be
"So, why the spike? Were there Chinese millionaires who didn’t hear about Tesla till the gigafactory was built there? I mean personally as someone who bought Tesla in the $200s I am loving this and not making any accusations. I just can’t think of what can cause this much of a surge in a short time."
What’s crazy is this isn’t even their final form
"Tesla is going to make cars into an asset that can appreciate and realiably generate cash flow for an owner. 

The automotive side of Tesla is like an automated version of Turo that makes cars."
"Great, now if they could stop being the worst car service company in American ever...

Downvote the truth I see. Nice."
"As proud as I am of Tesla's products and innovations, I am just as disappointed with the lack of innovation from older more established companies. So as Tesla stock goes up, so should the others go down.

"Only thing I really disagree with is supporting China, as I hate China with a passion. But I still idolize Elon, I would happily serve as a bodygaurd for him."
"So-called Detroit 3 automakers? Uh... They are automakers in Detroit (maybe not as much Chrysler lmao), not sure there's anything so-called about that lol"
Honest question - I thought two other guys built it from scratch and Elon bought in and moved them out.  I mean built a small company into a huge one but still.
Should we tell them they’re not a car company? 🤫
"Is that claim adjusted for GDP, or no?"
He bought Tesla from the 2 guys..
This is right.  The current stock price indicates that they are broadly being valued as a tech company and not as a car company.  The valuation now assumes a capacity to scale core business as well as expand to new untapped business lines that is unlike what can be assumed of any car company.
"And Tesla owns their stores which means:

* No splitting margins with middlemen
* No barrier to online sales
* Salesmen get trained to sell EVs, 
* Prime objective is to sell EVs even if that requires extensive customer education
* The valuation of stores and superchargers adds to the valuation of the company
* Store location can be easily optimized to improve improve sales
* Tesla can easily install fast chargers at stores"
"As an ex Tesla bear, this is accurate. Most equity analysts at BB Banks are clueless on how to value Tesla. The standard auto industry model does not work. Tesla is so trailblazing that the analysts are still scratching their heads trying to figure and in the meanwhile fear/hating something that they don’t understand. 

Ps: reason why I closed all my shorts and became a bull here https://happypathfire.com/tesla-bear-to-bull/"
Their software advantage is generation ahead of other auto makers. Have you seen the in system stuff they ship these days. “You have to take it to the dealer for the software update to be installed” lmao. Meanwhile Tesla added Netflix and a bunch of other apps via an oat update.
"I said, on another account, sometime around the $420 incident, that I think Tesla will alternate in big swings between being undervalued and overvalued as the market struggles to valuate the company.

The shorts saw a huckster running a company.  It was clear to see that they were incredibly wrong back then.  The bulls saw a rocket ship tech company.  But I think it's going to be a slow burn.  It's not facebook or google that created new markets and dominated them.  As as of now Tesla pretty much only makes money by selling cars.  Their software goals are so ambitious that the ""killer product"" is still 5-10 years away.  Their energy goals are probably not likely to be realized until much further out.  I said then that the time to short Tesla is when the shorts got burned and walked away.  It might be time to do that now.

We've seen other publicly traded companies this ambitious.  But we haven't seen a public company whose valuation is based on ambition that is so many years away from being realized.  I have no intent to bet against Elon, but I may bet against the people who aren't expecting this to take an entire generation."
"Exactly. It's like calling Apple a phone company.  

Tesla's mission statement is: to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.  

Cars are just the main thing, like Apple with iPhone."
People should focus more on how Tesla is enhancing sustainable energy with solar and cars. People forget that.
"Vertical integration or no vertical integration, what matters is profitability and growth.  If other automakers are outsourcing parts like upholstery, they pay those other companies, and the costs get rolled into their financials.  In the end, profitability is the end goal of the business.

That said, I'd love to see someone give real justification for why this stock is being valued as high as it is.  It's currently worth more than GM and Ford combined, even though those companies sold over 37x more cars in 2018 than Tesla sold in 2019, and generated $13 billion in profits, whereas Tesla will have an annual loss this year, just like they've had every year of their 15 year existence.  

Q3 generated a surprise net profit, but it was a special case driven by a temporary fall in commodity prices and Q2 employee layoffs and wage cuts that saw restructuring costs accounted for completely in Q2, with all the financial benefits realized in Q3.  Q4 on the other hand saw Tesla announce they'd be hiring again and raising wages (obviously they over did it in Q2 giving them quite the Q3 windfall), and commodities prices have bounced off their Q2/Q3 lows.  Q3 also saw a big one time deferred revenue realization from FSD.  I'm curious what they released for FSD in Q4 that would allow them to realize any more.  They did very little supercharger build out in Q3 which is pretty much entirely a loss maker, but they did start ramping build out again in Q4, so that's added cost.

They're certainly selling more cars overall, and with China coming online, they'll be able to sell more.  

Model S and X sales, the highest margin cars, have fallen pretty significantly since last year.  They're down globally,  but if you look at only the US, S is down from 25,700 last year to 14,100 this year.  Model X is down from 26,100 last year to 19,200 this year.  That's after cutting prices on both models.  On the plus side, since shorter range models are no longer on their order page, they likely sold less of those, but whether that makes up for the loss of sales is anyone's guess.

I wouldn't be shocked if they saw a lower profit in Q4 than in Q3 or even a loss, even with selling more cars.

This stock has a history of spikes up and down.  This certainly seems like one of those short lived high spikes."
How many solar roofs have they installed?
"I should also mention that the MAIN reason Tesla is winning is not electrification, it’s actually software. 

Tesla is the only automaker with more software engineers than any other kind. Software has radically transformed most other industries; auto making lags but it is also inevitable that profit in the industry will flow to software. 

If you want a car that is smarter than your cellphone, there’s only one brand for you. 

If you want profit in the auto industry, you need to make it in software. Full stop. 

Welcome to 2020."
Its crazy that this sub has over 600k subs. You gotta thing there is insane future demand n exponential interest.
"> sells every car they can make 

Then how do you explain Model S and X sales?"
"Funny, you mention Apple but the first company I thought of was Google. But yours is probably a much more apt comparison."
"Yep, I don’t have an income yet. But every penny I get is going to be used to buy shares, they’re not staying at ~$400 for long."
"This, but every other piece of the OS as well. SO many updates that keep giving me new features to a car I've had for over 6 months. No other car company has done this up to this point."
My car for a 4 way dashcam update for free a year after I bought it. Unbelievable.
"Revenue in 2019 is going to wind up under 14% higher than 2018.  That is good, but not really exceptional considering vehicle deliveries increased 49.6% (Model 3 production in the first half of 2018 was only 38,344 vehicles vs 135,225 in the first half of 2019).  

There are two obvious drivers for revenue growth in 2020 - production in China and the introduction of the Model Y.  However, those boosts are going to be offset by a rapidly deteriorating product mix for the Model 3 (propped up by introduction of the model in Europe and RHD markets in 2019), continued pressure on S/X sales (down 33% in 2019), and cannibalization of Model 3 and Model X sales by the Model Y.  

Current analyst estimates for 2020 revenue are for a roughly 23.5% gain to ~$30 billion.  However, keep in mind that as late as the end of March of 2019 the average analyst estimate for 2019 revenue was $27.85 billion (i.e. ~13.5% higher than the actual number).  If revenue growth fails to hit 20% for a second consecutive year I don't see how anything close to the current equity valuation remains justified."
">Pretty obvious that GM or Ford in Detroit's heyday was still more valuable when you correct for inflation.

It's possible and even probable but I wouldn't say it's obvious. You need to run the actual numbers which surprisingly they didn't do in the OP even though they pointed out inflation was a factor. Probably being adjusting for inflation is kind of a tricky thing."
No stats are especially meaningful when they involve Tesla doing well from what I've learned..
"1000x this. I made a whole post about this recently. Market cap would tell you that Tesla is being valued more than 2x Ford when really by enterprise value they are worth less than Ford because Ford is so racked with debt. It's like saying your house is worth more than the mansion next to you because you have a higher percentage of ownership than your neighbor.

And before people come to call me a bean counter or say I belong in a manual labor camp (yes that happened on my post) I believe this is all the more reason why Tesla should be worth as much or more than Ford and the stock has room to grow."
"Hey, c'mon. It bought our Model 3, and it's mostly there to our upcoming Model Y."
Yep. Ford has produced 450~ million vehicles and Tesla has yet to surpass 1 million. Exercise caution with the ego Tesla fam
The value of a company is meaningful
"Doesn't take account debt either, so very misleading."
The headline is trash. The article mentions that as the first caveat if you bothered to read it.
Daring innovators like freedom. Over regulation has killed y'all's culture.
"A lot of folks chasing consulting jobs out of college in the states and I work with a lot of it enterprise companies. The saying here is that during the gold Rush only one group got rich. The folks selling the shovels.

Consulting wise the states do great and on breeding new software innovation. But having worked in manufacturing almost all our high end factories are sold by the Germans."
It's not that bad if you look at total enterprise value. The article only compares market cap which is misleading.
It’s against the law for a car company to sell directly to a customer. The dealership lobby got a law passed here because our legislators are idiots. So now we gotta go to Ohio to buy and service our cars.
"Yeah this is a misleading headline,  it's not inflation adjusted. They'll get there, just not yet."
"Yep. Ford in its early days made the vast majority of all the worlds cars, disrupted the market, created new markets, was vertically integrated, was a technological market leader. Ford sold literally many million Model Ts, something Tesla can only dream of."
i would sure hope so....
"It's a super risky move on a very volatile stock. It's a gamble, not unlike betting on roulette. You can win 36 to 1 on roulette though. 

If you believe in the company then you can make it make sense but that's not a sound investment thesis, rather emotions guiding your decision."
They arent going to generate cash flow for the owner. They are going to generate cash flow for themselves. I absolutely think that if Tesla figures out self driving cars first they will add some sensors on an improved model and exclude the current cars for being able to be in the program.
"Just buy enough of the stock and then you will eventually get a new car for “free”

Kidding. Sorta."
"Are you really asking why Apple is so valuable? I'd like to redirect you to my friend [Edgar](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0000320193&owner=exclude&count=40&hidefilings=0), you'll find answers there."
Their brand is very popular. They offer great products as far as I'm concerned. I'm not an Apple user anymore but their customer experience is their best quality.
"Apple:

* is a global retailer
* has strong performance in china
* has an enclosed tech ecosystem that strongly encourages consumers (and their family and friends) to buy multiple apple products
* has strong customer retention
* has somehow convinced everyone that they're artists
* has somehow convinced everyone that artists need apple products
* has strong litigation game and viciously protects its IP
* has had some legitimately industry-leading products, even if they were all stolen from other companies (the mouse, the ipod, the iphone, airpods, the apple watch, etc)

Tim Cook is no innovator, but he's a damn good CEO. And by that, I mean he's really really good at growing Apple's market cap."
"They meant so-called 'Detroit 3' insinuating they have dominated and stayed as ""the 3"" for an established period of time. Meaning this statement holds no weight anymore. Nothing to do with the city ..."

"Indeed. What is this, a Tucker reboot? Big three? Japan ate most of their lunch 30 years ago."
They existed for about a year before Elon joined. He was the biggest source of funding at the time. They hadn’t released any car before Elon joined. He’s the one that took Tesla to where it is now.
"You should look in terms of pre-Dec 2008 and post-Dec 2008. Tesla exists post-Dec 2008 only because of Elon. Period. And whatever has happened after that period is because he drove it. So yes Tesla is as it exists today becasue of Elon. It is similar to Berkshire-Buffett and Starbucks-Schultz scenario. Many don't even know that some other ppl started companies. Even if they did, they wouldn't say these companies are in today's state because of original founders."
"You are correct. 

From Wikipedia: “Tesla was founded in July 2003, by engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, under the name Tesla Motors. The company's name is a tribute to engineer Nikola Tesla. In early Series A funding, Tesla Motors was joined by Elon Musk, J. B. Straubel and Ian Wright, all of whom are retroactively allowed to call themselves co-founders of the company. Musk, who formerly served as chairman and is the current chief executive officer, said that he envisioned Tesla Motors as a technology company and independent automaker, aimed at eventually offering electric cars at prices affordable to the average consumer. Tesla Motors shortened its name to Tesla in February 2017.”"
The article says that the claim is not adjusted for inflation if that’s what you meant? Not sure how you adjust it to GDP.
"You're getting downvoted without explanation.

Let me explain why that is incorrect.

Elon Musk did not buy tesla from them. There were 2 engineers who had a plan to build battery powered cars. They needed funding so they looked around. They met Elon at initial funding as he was looking to invest in them.

They were just 2 employees at that point of a company they incorporated called Tesla motors. They had no cars, no plan for how to build, no prototype and nothing much besides some idea slides. 

So Elon joined them with his funding pretty much as employees Num 3. He was listed as Co founder retroactively as well.

They expanded and got more people and took off the ground thanks to Elon. He was very instrumental in getting the roadster built and the brainchild of the 2006 master plan wthe expensive cars first and then after early adoption into mainstream cars. They're close with Model 3 and Model Y. 

The 2 original guys had a falling out with Elon and left in 2008.

Elon has been and is the father and creator of Tesla. The other 2 guys were the initial mini spark but the huge raging fire is Elon

Edit :
When cooking food, if you lit the fire that cooked the food with a match that then quickly went out, would you say the match cooked the food or the fire that was burning cooked the food? That's basically the gist there. Elon is the fire and the 2 engineers are the matchstick."
"He bought dirty garage and few battery cells, and transformed it into successful global corporation that manufactures and sells much more than just cars.

But you are totally right, he technically didn't found it, he just did all the difficult work."
"I don’t fully agree. They have the highest margin vehicles in the business and the only thing hindering their sales in the short run is production capacity and as their sales grow, so too, will their margins. As the market moves towards fully electric vehicles, Tesla will maintain a 5+ year tech advantage for the foreseeable future and people will have to choose between their favorite old brand and a car that charges faster, has more places to charge, better range and longer lasting batteries. The alternative is that Tesla sells their skateboards, licenses their tech, charges for access to super chargers and makes money off every vehicle sold on the planet. I’d say their valuation prices in their future monopoly status over the rest of the auto industry.

Edit: I know Porsche and Ferrari have higher margins, but I don’t really consider that Tesla’s business right now. The model S competes in that space, but beating Ferrari and Porsche isn’t the path the beating the big auto makers."
Would those untapped businesses include selling batteries to other car companies? Or licensing their self driving technologies to others?
its a software company that sells cars
"If true, this should frighten anybody who is holding TSLA stock.  At some point the game will be up on FSD and the market is going to start looking at Tesla much more like the car company it is and not the tech company it presents itself as.  Given the plentiful warning signs that the current tech bubble is ready to correct, it could happen soon."
"Tesla owners can attest to the amazing buying experience. Unlike a traditional dealership where you spend the whole afternoon to purchase a car. Not to mention the dealer will first push you to buy the non-electric first before reluctantly showing you the bolt that you were interested in.        
Many dealerships make money on service and electric cars have fewer moving parts and their service revenue will be cut significantly.        
I think this sort of goes back to the old logic of why entrenched companies don’t innovate and are often “disrupted”. If you don’t cannibalize your own product, someone else will."
"The stores are probably leased, and therefore some of your points are moot.
The staff and service techs are mostly a cost center that Tesla attempts to minimize.  Having an adversarial relationship between the dealer and the manufacturer can be advantageous to the customer.

I used to hate the dealer model, but after Tesla's execution, I have an appreciation."
"Larry Page and Tim Cook ~~believe in climate change~~ accept as fact that we must act to counter the climate catastrophe. They both control over $100 billion in cash. Tesla is the bellwether of climate change solutions. 

This is what the bears don't understand. If Tesla were to get in trouble, Larry and Tim have a *personal* reason to keep Tesla solvent, *and* they have the means to do so.  

It doesn't matter if the bears believe in climate change or not. Larry and Tim do. And that's all that matters for the 10-Q."
"Damn, I loved your dissertation, especially the conclusion."

">It's not facebook or google that created new markets and dominated them. 

I think that you could make the argument that they did create a new market - a market for electric cars, which is still pretty different than an ICE. At this point they are dominating that market and haven't seen any real proper competition, which is also helping this price excel. I think seeing how Porche couldn't even get close on efficiency with their batteries showed investors just how far ahead they are and that it wasn't just a plug and play method to get into the market."
">	but I may bet against the people who aren’t expecting this to take an entire generation.

That’s a risky bet in of itself lol. Tesla investors, at least the serious ones know that Tesla is a slow burn. Even Elon Musk himself said that if you’re interested in investing in Tesla it should be long term. ~2 years ago during an investors call, he even publicly asked all short to medium term investors to GTFO of his company.

Personally I am treating TSLA like a savings account/pseudo-retirement account at this point. I put any spare money I have in, and just leave it. Yes it hit $470 today and I’ve more than doubled, but I don’t give a fuck. My goal is to withdrawal when I’m 65 and the stock is several thousands per share."
"> As as of now Tesla pretty much only makes money by selling cars. 

Right now,they make *most* of their money selling cars, would not be surprised to see Q4's numbers showing the first uptick in the energy division. Elon said he expected big numbers from that this year. If they can make good on their plans to radically increase battery production and thus bring prices down further, the market for all kinds of new products will dwarf the already large market for their cars."
What's the source on the killer product being 5-10 years away?
"Tesla's got a lot of tailwind from the climate crisis though. Even if they struggle at some points, as long as they seem to have more of an idea what they're doing than anyone else they will be valued as a market leader. It's a time for bold companies, especially in the transport and energy markets.

They do need to keep ahead in R&D and production of the boring fundamental tech, batteries, solar panels, electric motors, software. So far it seems like they are able to maintain and even extend a lead, even in the face of massive investment by competitors, but it's not a certain thing by any means, competitors *are* getting more serious about this and should be well-funded enough to try and fail a couple of times, while Tesla may find it harder to find new ways to jump ahead."
"What do you think of the recent after hours run ups in the stock price?

Do you think this regular hours run up between the Q4 numbers announcement, on 1/3/2020, and the Q4 earnings report on 1/29/2020 is:

1: A sign or severely overbought?

2: A sign of shorts covering?

3: A sign of broad uncertainty due to Iran causing many investors to view Tesla as a safe haven?

4: The market trying to price in the upcoming S&P inclusion bump?

5: none of the above ( your theory of why the stock seams to be on a tear after breaking the 420 barrier)

Help me understand this 1/3 to 1/29 period.

What do you think will happen leading up to and on 1/29?"
This statement is crazy. Like calling Apple a phone company. Did people forget they make computers. Man it's been a crazy 2 decades.
Solar roofs are a niche right now but their bread and butter is just plain ol solar panels.
I often think how if my Model 3 used an ICE instead of an electric motor it would still be an incredible vehicle. It's understandably easy to focus on Teslas being EVs but that aside they are also great cars

"That just means tesla didn't finish developing the feature in time for launch, so they included the nonfunctional hardware and added the software to make it work later.

No other car company does this for better or worse. Other car companies would either finish the feature before launch or cut it."
"Stats need the right interpretation, and that takes expertise a normal person doesn't have. Business news sites manipulate these people into misinterpreting numbers so they can try to get people to buy or sell something.

"Elon needs to go federal to get rid of this stupid shit.

Fuck regulations.
I don't think Tesla has any dreams of selling Model T's.
"Yea any reasonable car person knows Ford is the king. Not only in sales, but value in paving the way for the entire auto industry for the next 100+ years. And the assembly line transformed no only the auto industry but the entire manufacturing industry. 

Tesla's are great cars, and have set an entire new standard for future cars. But most valuable car company every? That's being a bit pretentious."
"I just don't see how EVs adoption can possibly revert or how any other EV manufacturer can rival them.

They are in a great spot now, and that's JUST thanks to being good car makers. But they are also leading in all this tech revolutions that will explode in the coming years (self-driving, robotaxies, batteries, solar)."
"Um, it's absolutely in the interest of Tesla to allow owners to lend out their vehicles with full self driving. They're probably going to incentivize it.

Edit: The owners have already fronted the capital for Tesla. Owners renting shifts a lot of the risk from Tesla to the owner as opposed to using company owned vehicles. The fleet is already there.

That list took like 5 seconds to think of, dude."

According to Wikipedia they also left / were kicked out in 2008 and one of them filed a libel suit against Musk which he later dropped.
"If I remember correctly, I got to get up close and personal to the true first owners at the LA auto show when they were displaying the roadster in the independent manufacturer section. They were cool humble guys. Tesla is in the state they are today because of these guys and the tech they developed. Not Elon."

maybe % of GDP?
"Our echo has been increasing in absolute value for centuries, and the stock market right along with it.  So it is not surprising that we will continue to see records broken on company valuation."
Porsche has the highest in the industry at 50% gross profit margins.  Tesla is 25%.   Elon even mentioned this in one of his presentations that he wants Porsche level margins.
"Highest margin vehicles are Porsche, Ferrari and some versions of the f150"
"The best margins per vehicle for Legacy Auto comes through servicing, achieved by them putting little effort into vehicle longevity."
"Monopoly status in the global car market doesn't exist. Tesla doesn't make a car at every price point. Electric cars are going to be ubiquitous like a microwaves. Now tell me which microwave company is a monopoly. I foresee the same thing with electric cars. Suspension tuning and aero dynamics will be very important in the future something I see legacy auto excelling. You are right about range and longer lasting batteries. But the charging scenario will be dominated by 150-350kW chargers globally as more and more autos join the CCS standard that Tesla is a part of. The next decade will be exciting indeed. Semi's, buses and delivery trucks being electric will put a dent in fossil fuel usage"
"Yes it’s true the FSD will be the ultimate decision point. However as much as it’s true that if Tesla become car company the stock will drop, if they figure out FSD then they are **extremely** undervalued. The possibilities are absolutely endless. We are at split road of where Tesla will be heading in the future.

Let’s just say I wouldn’t bet against Elon. He’s literally created one impossible thing after another (not by himself of course, but the people that he gathers along with him). Him and his team revolutionized the payment industry, online shopping, electric vehicles, landing fucking rockets... the list goes on. If history means anything, it’s to not bet against Elon and his team."
"What are the reasons people are expecting the current tech bubble to correct soon?

I'm not a financial analyst, so forgive me if this sounds incredibly dumb, but I would imagine that Tesla is valuable for reasons that are contrary to the reasons the current tech bubble is expected to correct, and is still in the early stages of it's uptick."
Don’t forget batteries.
FSD is only one part of their technology portfolio.  Are you betting that FSD won’t be released in the next two years?
"Is it really that bad in the US? 
the last EV I bough was a Hyundai and I went into the dealership asked about the car, got a quick rundown of it's features, test-drove it for two hours and went home to evaluate. After two days I called in to confirm the offer and bought it.  
Without the test drive it was at most half an hour total. No one tried to get me into a ice and they mostly knew what they were talking about."
"I thought you were joking at first, because the Tesla buying experience is awful.  

In a traditional dealership, you may spend an afternoon, but my experience was waiting ""4-8 weeks"", which in reality ended up being 11 weeks, all while having an awful time with communication and getting un-truths from the representatives on where the car was on the path to me (in production, in Arizona, on a train, stuck on truck, etc.).  

My next Tesla I'll be buying from on-hand stock if at all possible."
"> Having an adversarial relationship between the dealer and the manufacturer can be advantageous to the customer.

Maybe - but my friend literally spent NINE hours leasing a Honda. The tried to stiff him with a lower model than he was paying for. 

He was ready to walk away, and saw the person he'd dealt with in the past, who helped rectify the situation. 

He also overheard another family arguing and fighting about a bait and switch. 

This was at a highly rated Honda dealer in NYC."
I'm not sure I follow.  Where is the advantage to the customer?
Tesla can work to improve service but other manufacturers are saddled with their dealers acting like an anchor around their neck hindering their transition to EVs and AVs.
Money talks. Period!
I think we shouldn't use the word believe. We should use the word accept. Believe still somewhat implies there is a counter argument based on something they know. It leaves doubt for someone else to question.

"Yep, Tesla is a market innovator, just like Google, Apple, or Facebook.  Google had competition from large, established companies like Yahoo, Apple had Blackberry and others (in mobile), and Facebook had MySpace.  Tesla now has VWAG and others coming for them in EVs, but they have the advantage of first to market with a mass produced vehicle."
"My flair is a bit outdated.  I do have long term shares that I didn't feel any itch sell off at $180 or whatever it was and won't sell off even at $1000.

Does anybody still use this site?  Everybody I know left because of all the unfair censorship and content deletion.
"Pretty similar. So far my Tesla position has more than doubled, not going to sell until I think Tesla owns a good chunk of the EV, solar, and battery market.


Tesla owns a large chunk of a very small EV market (less than 3% of all U.S. cars sold are EVs; sorry, don't have global numbers). This market should grow substantially over the next 10 years and I expect Tesla to one of the leaders, if not the lead.  


I'm a very long term bull holding for 20+ years."
There isn't one. He's guessing.
"Just a guess.   Look at where Autopilot is today.  And look how long it took to get here.

And then consider when FSD is ready for widespread adoption there must be regulatory approval. We can only guess at how long that will take, but most people seem to believe that the time frame will be measured in years not months.

Edit:  There will be tremendous pressure for regulatory approval of FSD and I'm sure it will be fast tracked. I understand CA and NHTSA are working with Tesla and other tech companies to fast track level 4 autonomy but I don't have any special knowledge of those relationships.  If this is going to be anything like the approval process today or the pharma approval process, we are talking years after the software is ready for widespread rollout.  It has now been years since regulators were asked to approve cameras to replace side view mirrors.  And it's still not legal.

So 5 years sounds extremely optimistic to me."
"It's probably going to be first to market with an automated car able to pick up passengers.

Tech will be there in 5 but it will take a lot longer for regulatory to accept it"

It's a fact that short interest is suddenly and significantly down in a company that has historically had extreme short interest.  That's definitely a factor in the run.  How of this is just a short squeeze would be nothing more than speculation.  I think a lot of people saw at least part of this run from miles away.
"And it was all Steves idea. From Wikipedia:

Uhhh they hardly install any of those company to prior to the buyout.
"Back when I bought my first Model S in 2013, I used to say ""if this thing ran on $6/gal \*whale oil\* I would still \*want\* it, I just wouldn't be able to afford it."""
"Definitely waiting for the right time to buy my own Model S / Model 3 as a daily.

In EU they are considerably more expensive than US. For around 35k€ the best you can get is a 2013 Model S. The likely cost of a new battery scares me too much to consider that.

The ""best option"" is buying brand new Model 3 for 50k€ (expensive for many people). Or a 2-3 year old Model S for the same price. None of the alternatives (Leaf, Zoe, i3 ...) are even close for highway use for example.

Fuel prices here are in record highs (1.45€/Litre of Diesel, petrol is 1,75€/Litre) so if you do lots of miles (100+ per day), it gets pretty expensive to keep your old ICE for daily driving."
Production and sales numbers are down?
I suggest you take a look at some Tesla new software notes to get an idea of the extent of the kinds of updates they push out on a regular basis. It’s on another level is what I’m trying to get at
And my BlackBerry could send emails and browse the internet way before the iPhone came out. Sometimes it’s in the implementation and the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.
"Yeah I have a dual dashcam (front / rear), but couldn't figure out how to do the sides. Installation and placement wouldve been a pain."

"My model S figured out when its raining and gave me rain sensing wipers in an update.  


Fuck the other car companies.  They would never do this for me.  Porsche's service is the only reason I might ever buy another one.  But that is quickly being crossed off my list with their Electric Turbo naming convention."

One is used sarcastically.
So musk must have said something about him he didn’t like and then when proven it was true he dropped the suit?
Did they have anything to do with the S?
"This is what I suspected - this isn't a strictly historical question, there are people who consider themselves defenders of Musk and seem invested in who he is beyond what's strictly factual.  I'm cool with that and I really like my X, but I think this is the way people start to grow a rich patina of myth.  

Didn't mean to pick a fight by contesting that Musk 'grew Tesla from scratch', just wondering if I'm seeing myth-building in action.  I think I kinda am.

Oh, and dhibhika, I wouldn't dispute Musk's success on building Tesla, it's a remarkably accomplishment.  But that's kinda my point - I'm not *inclined* to dispute it because I'm not attacking Musk, just trying to understand what happened back then.  And what's happening here."

"And yet, look at GM's stock."
"Let me rephrase, they have the highest margins in their class. Ferrari also has higher margins, but in the long run Tesla’s demand will far outpace both of those companies."
"I responded to this comment by another. A single model of the F-150 may be margin-rich, but Ford overall has margins of 11%."
As well as options.
Terrible at analogies
You should short them.
You sound like a horse salesman at the turn of the 20th century.
FSD is really valuable when only you have it.  As soon as someone else has it then it’s just table stakes.
"Elon has been remarkably successful as a businessman, I agree.  But AP has trouble staying on the road sometimes, and FSD isn't just about sensors, it's about decision making.  Reality will eventually assert itself."
"Look at the massive amount of money dumped into garbage like wework as a prime example. There are hundreds if not thousands more.

That being said, I disagree that tesla is valued as a tech company like the ones that will pop, tesla makes things, and customer service aside, they make them well. There's no comparison between the two."
"Yes, and it is a battery company.  What it isn't, is a tech company, so it'll be difficult to sustain a valuation like one."
Yes. FSD is quite a long ways off yet.  Maybe in some niche situations we will see progress.  But I'm very confident that the fleet of robotaxi model 3s is not ever happening.  I'd love to be proven wrong.
"Hell, I'm long on Tesla and I don't think functional FSD will hit production cars anywhere near inside 2 years. It'll happen eventually, but that one is solidly in Elon-time"
FSD without a taxi service isn’t very meaningful and I don’t think that will be nationwide in two years.
"It depends dealership you dealership. Probably took 5 hours from the time I arrived on the lot, made a decision, played a whole “idk if I want it”, leave, get called back in, bargain some more, try to leave again (part of the plan), got a good offer finally, then wait to fill out the paperwork."
"According to [the scorecard](https://insideevs.com/news/343998/monthly-plug-in-ev-sales-scorecard/) Hyundai sold ~1000 Kona EVs and ~500 Ionic EVs in the US in 2019. You much have visted one of the few Hyundai dealerships in the country, probably in California, where these vehicles are available for sale. 

The EV buying experience at an average Hyundai dealership is not so smooth."
The buying experience is another story and sucks.  I was somewhat restricting my critique to the service side.  Some middle ground would be nice.
"The dealer is reimbursed for service.  It's within their interest to both attract customers to their location and also not be overly zealous in their claims denial.  They are motivated to advocate on the customers behalf.

With a single vertical, everything after the initial car sale is cost to Tesla and your only recourse is dealing with Tesla directly or arbitration."
"""recognize the urgency to act"" would be even better. ""Accept"" could mean: well, I'm rich, so I probably won't be affected personally."
Correct.
"> but they have the advantage of first to market with a mass produced vehicle.

Not their only advantage, or their biggest."

"It’s not at all. Long term, Tesla is just going to keep growing. It’s literally a better savings account than a CD."
";) precisely. Rather than argue with people who provide arbitrary 'some day' guesses, I just ask them for a source."
"Elon says ""end of 2020"". and he's in a better position to know than any of us. After applying the standard Elon Time discount of about a year, I think the most realistic prediction is 2021. 2025 isn't optimistic at all based on the history of Tesla's achievements and given what we saw demonstrated at Tesla's autonomy event nearly a year ago."
"Musk is boring a tunnel under the Las Vegas Convention Center as I type this. It’s supposed to be ready by next year’s CES. There will be a line of Tesla’s that will be self driving. They will shuttle Convention goers to and fro. Tech is already here, no regulatory needed, so long as they can bore that hole in time it’s happening.

I should also mention there’s a lineup of BMW’s been driving around Vegas since 2018. They are robo taxi’s operated by Lyft, self driving vehicles that pick passengers up and drop them at destination: https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/aptivs-self-driving-bmws-have-made-more-than-50000-rides-on-the-lyft-app-in-las-vegas/

I’ll add one more thing. If a self driving car can succeed in Vegas, it can succeed anywhere. Drivers here are psychopaths, they are beyond aggressive and many streets like east bound Desert Inn as it goes over the strip don’t even have lines for the car to follow."
"Any thoughts on the 1/29 earnings report?  The last earnings report saw a 20% bump up, but with the current run it’s hard to believe that the Q4 report will any steam left."
"I know them. Sometimes they add essential features that every car already had for years and sometimes they add cool features like Netflix and games and sometimes they nerf cars like the models with the 85kwh batteries or when they switched the model 3 in Europe from the good Telekom Network to the mediocre telefonica network.  
It's a two edged sword."

Probably called him a pedo
"they really barely had anything to do with the final roadster...  smart engineers for sure, but Elon was able to put the engineering and the management together and actually build the company"
"The earlier company-CEO pairs of Berkshire-Buffett and Starbucks-Schultz are great examples and similar to Tesla-Musk.  Others might be Victoria's Secret-Wexner and McDonalds-Kroc.

Have you looked into any of these company stories before?

To build 'from scratch' may be hyperbole, but in each case above the company founders were but initial seeds to an idea or a brand name to expand.  Each CEO  above is synonymous with their company and they as individuals were the driving force in what was created.  They basically ""re-"" founded the company when they took control by sending it in a different strategic direction or just using the brand name as an anchor for a new business.

A few from-scratch founders would be Nike-Knight and Amazon-Bezos."
It's stable - barely moved inyears!  It doesn't even move with inflation it's so stable!
"The Porsche is the legend, all models are profitable. The taycan is probably the highest margin EV to date"
"Ford’s vehicle sales are 11% margins, but you’re right they’re just financing and fixing their shit products to make money so I don’t know their true profit/vehicle."
Nope I will support them.
"Not necessarily. There’s an endless list of different business directions a company can take once they develop FSD.

I personally think FSD won’t be a 1 company type of business. There’s going to be several companies providing a variety of services."
"AP is also a very different than what they are working on, it is not at all indicative of FSD progress.

In fact, they specifically said that AP is manually coded, while the FSD they’re working on is neural net learning.

It’s comparing Apples to... not even oranges. It’s like comparing Apples to grape juice. They’re so different that if you’re using AP as a reference for FSD, you’re going to be very wrong.

Also Elon is less a businessman and more of an engineer. It’s the reason why his “impossible” ventures are one success after another. A businessman run numbers, an engineer looks at the possibility of a project and knows it’s physically possible before they even begin.

In one of Elon’s interviews, he said he breaks down a problem to its most fundamental values, and work up from there. He didn’t go “I wonder if I can make an electric car company successful”, instead he asks “is it possible to make a good electric car with the material/technology we have today?” and work his way up.

FSD is the same. They wouldn’t be pursuing this if the fundamentals are not possible. They’ve determined that with enough neural net training, a computer can drive as well, if not better than a human. The physics and the theory is sound. It’s just a matter of time."
People have problems staying on the road a lot of times.
"> it's about decision making. 

And?  Do you think FSD is not possible?"
"What is ""we work"" and why is it garbage?"
Why are you so confident that it literally *cannot* happen?
RemindMe! January 2022
"The data created from FSD might well surpass the value in a taxi service. Also, long haul trucking from a company with an electric semi in the works comes to mind. The logistics industry would dump every driver they have tomorrow and increase profitability by an order of magnitude. Taxi is small potatoes comparatively and localized. Everyone place uses trucking. Only large metros would need taxis until the market shifts such that people no longer own cars but use a service - which I think will take a looong time as we like our cars and driving them. I think Tesla made a smart bet on the semi."
"Once they have a fsd system trulely going, it will revolutionize everything like how amazon revolutionized buying stuff."
"No I bought it in Germany.  
There aren't that many more ioniqs here but you can get them."
"I cannot imagine a system in which dealers are incentivized to do more service work?   Dealers want the service contract.  They want the customer to purchase that contract from them, and that is where their revenue derives.  Everything else surely must be costs?  That way dealer and mfg are aligned.

The mfgs put the system in place, it would be crazy of them to do anything different."
"i think their biggest is how i compare teslas and other cars to iphones and dumb phones.

since 2006, cars have had computers in them, similarly dumb phones still had the tech to have an operating system and apps.  

the iphone revolutionized that idea by making it clean, seamless, easy to use and powerful, which is exactly what tesla is doing with the computers in their car."

">  and he's in a better position to know than any of us. 

Then please explain why he has been wildly inaccurate in virtually every other estimate of when FSD capabilities would be available.

I think you are right.  The only tricks up their sleeves that I can think of right now would be earnings from trading emissions credits and higher margins.  I suspect the Q4 focus on EU deliveries has a lot do with those credits.
"lol you don’t sound biased at all! I’ve gotten safety features added, more entertainment options, Smart Summon, increased power to the car and so much more. I’m not saying everything is perfect, but it’s leaps and bounds ahead of what any other company is doing with their software. My biggest complaint is customer service- that’s the main issue imo but most likely due to their incredible growth speed."
You said it didn’t mention inflation whereas paragraphs 5 & 6 clearly mention your exact point. Did it calculate 1999 Ford’s value in today’s dollars? No. But it’s the first caveat after the graph if you scroll past it.
Lmao maybe 🤷🏻‍♂️
"That's what I would have thought too. Even if they had a cool design and some tech, they certainly didn't have much at all to do with Tesla's position in the market today. Sure, they got an awesome concept together, but they didn't drive any of the decisionmaking that led to the Tesla of today."
"Oh hey, I know it happens sometimes - didn't Bezos literally start out in his garage?  I'm just struck by the fact that I've occasionally come across CEO stories that were much larger than life, and I've wondered how they grow so.  

For instance.  I've never heard anyone trying to over-talk Bezos, he seems to have actually started with just himself.  But I've also had occasion to talk to folks who seemed set on convincing me that Bill Gates personally wrote DOS from scratch (he didn't), created the mouse/icon interface (he stole it from Apple, who I believe stole it from Xerox), or single-handedly created the personal computer (uh, no).  Odd thing was that they seemed to really take it personally when I said I'd heard differently.

Since then I've kept half an eye on this sorta thing, and I've wondered if there wasn't some PR guys out there encouraging this kinda thing.  Can't imagine what this'd buy you (other than ego), but it does seem to attach to some folks rather than others.  I've a half-baked theory that this happens mostly to people for whom it isn't true, especially of the more outlandish claims.  I mean nobody argues that Gates didn't start an extremely successful (and predatory) software company but then again that's not the kind of thing I hear bandied about with Gates.  If and when tempers flare on the subject (yes, I've seen it), it's to dispute that he's some sort of singular Einstein rather than a very successful businessman.  

My question is this: why are people so invested in these ideas?  This is in no way the subject of my own research but as a research guy, I notice things like this.  And I've noticed that Musk seems to attract a bit of this.  Claim that he single-handedly created the first Tesla in a cave like Tony Stark and people just sorta nod, but say he's a very successful money guy / showman and many folks bristle and 'defend him'.  I'm honestly unsure why.  If I were more curious I'd do as you suggest and read up on Buffett and whomever Knight is, but I've got a bit on my plate as it is.  It is interesting though."
"IIRC Porsche was late to the advanced manufacturing party (Toyota production system) and had trouble transforming from a craftsman culture (inherently less efficient, with a lot of backflow and rework) to just-in-time, one-piece-flow, kaizen, lean etc operation.

They've always had nice cars, but I suspect their margins have improved a lot in the last 25 years."
"The Taycan won’t be profitable until 2023.

"Very much this. Everything doesn’t necessarily become a commodity. Superior agility (in product architecture AND management AND process - e.g.  just because FSD exists doesn’t mean Toyota can implement it well. I look at the dog shit Sirius UConnect product in my minivan compared to Tesla), land grab/market share, and platform can keep one well ahead for long enough for the others to fold. Microsoft didn’t kill the iPhone for instance even though it was a phone with an App Store."
"Oh jeez.  Elon has as much engineering knowledge as most any undergrad.  He's a businessman.  That's what he's good at.

To think that deep neural nets are going to magically make FSD a reality is a deep misunderstanding of the technology and it's limitations.

If it's unrelated to what they're doing with AP then I would like them to stop the ""preview"" visualization crap.  It's not a good advertisement in any case, because it's terribly inaccurate.  If it has anything to do with their actual FSD effort, then they're decades away from release."
And that matters because?
"I think we are unlikely to see general purpose FSD in the foreseeable future, and on the Model 3, if it ever did happen, it's going to require a substantially improved sensor suite and a lot more compute.

FSD is a much more difficult problem than most people realize.  I think the driver assistance tech will improve and FSD in niche situations will increase, but for all practical purposes robotaxi is a dream."
Google it.
people taxi or product taxi isn't really a meaningful difference.   They're both taxi.
"Oh, yeah the dealership experience in the US is really unpredictable. In order to get a fair deal you must negotiate with salesmen who are experts at manipulating buyers. The dealers don't make a whole lot each vehicle sale so they will screw the buyer on trade-in value, lease down-payment, loan rates, and try to up-sell dealer add-on options or warranty/repair packages.

Here salesmen get a meager base salary and bonuses based on how many vehicles they manage to sell each month. Selling EVs requires spending a lot more time learning about the vehicles and then hours of customer education for each sale. Most salesmen would rather quickly sell an ICE vehicle. Salesmen who specialize in EVs don't make enough in bonuses due to the low volume and move on to other lines of work.

I think that outside of the US the manufacturers mostly own the stores directly which allows them a much greater control over everything related to the sales experience.  The hiring, training and compensation of salesmen.  

If you have the time [this podcast illustrates the inner workings of an average US dealership.](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/513/129-cars)"
"The comparison to Apple really bothers me, I find their products infuriating."
"I honestly can’t see any company that can overtake Tesla. Even in the worst case scenario where other car manufacturers makes better EVs, Tesla still has a solid and permanent foundation due to their battery gigafactories and energy products."
Lol why would people down you for literally a fact.
"FSD technology being ready and the legislation required for robotaxis are two completely separate issues. 

It’s entirely possible that the legislation won’t be in place within that timeframe. But that’s mostly irrelevant and I’ll explain why. 

First, the whole discussion is irrelevant if they don’t actually get FSD to work, so let’s start there.

Why do I believe FSD will be functional within 5 years? One situation that illustrates why is the progress it’s made in completing lane changes. The car has gone from making dog shit lane changes to nearly perfect lane changes within 6 months. 

That’s because they’ve only recently been employing the results of their machine learning strategy. If you’re not familiar, I highly recommend watching their autonomy day presentation. Lane changes that were programmed algorithmically were absolute garbage. They have almost a million cars on the road sending data back to Tesla to train their data sets. This is insane and will result in non-linear improvement. 

Why do I believe legislation is mostly irrelevant? The car drives itself on the highway *today*. It’s not subject to the legislation today because a person with a valid driver’s license is in the driver’s seat. It’s just fancy cruise control. You don’t need special legislation for it. 

One way around this “legislation problem” for robotaxis is to require the passenger to have a valid driver’s license and have them sit in the front seat. 

Sure, N number of passengers won’t have a driver’s license, but at that point it’s just a countdown until the laws are updated. Tesla will have already won."
"Because they essentially restarted from square one when they ended their relationship with Mobileye and began developing for AP2.

Have you watched the autonomy investor day conference? It's required viewing to be informed on this topic. Tesla & Elon are being much more reasonable with their current estimates than they were in the past."
"Good point, thanks.  There is also the extra profit from the $2000 speed upgrade and premium data subscriptions, but it seems like something odd is happening daily.

This should be a lul period while we await earnings, yet the daily buy in volume is huge.

What am I missing?"
"What safety features did you get?  
I do think the entertainment things are pretty cool but not necessary for me because I usually am not in my car when I'm charging.  
Increased power is really cool though.  

Sorry that I sound biased but sometimes spend time with Tesla owners and the ones I know made me happy that I haven't bought a car from them yet."
"An an extreme example, let's take Buffett.  He is CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, but he did not found Berkshire, he bought it.  Berkshire was a textile manufacturing company.  No one thinks that Buffett is a textile genius, but that also doesn't matter because Buffett re-created the company as an investment holding company financed by insurance premiums brought in by another company it holds.  Buffett is the founder of the modern Berkshire Hathaway and deserves accolades for all that he created.  Without Buffett there is no company today.  

Each of these other ""re""-founders did something similar. 

* Schultz worked at starbucks, started his own company, then purchased starbucks from original founders
* Wexner bought a chain of few lingerie stores plus a catalog from a guy trying to reduce anxiety of men buying garments for their wifes
* Kroc saw a restaurant and created a real estate company; there's a movie about it

Musk is CEO of Tesla, but he did not found Tesla or create it from scratch.  But when he joined, they had an idea for a car, but no actual car.  He had an idea for funding development, for competing on performance, for driver assistance.  Musk took an idea for a product and pushed it into something bigger, better, and more impactful.  Modern Tesla is something that Musk created.  Musk is the founder of the modern Tesla.

Why do people defend Musk?  Part of it is surely fanaticism.  But, some is also realistic.  Look at what Tesla was prior to Musk, while Must+Founders were together, and what it is after Musk is alone.  What you know of Tesla today is Musk + Franz, not Eberhard + Tarpenning.  They created a company, but not the one you know.  

* 2003 founded by Eberhard and Tarpenning 
* 2004 Musk joined; Musk leads Series A funding
* 2006 Series B funding; Roadster prototype
* 2007 Master Plan
* 2008 both founders leave Tesla in January; roadster enters production; Franz joins Tesla
* 2009 Model S prototype
* 2010 Tesla goes public
* 2012 Model S enters production

This isn't anything negative to Eberhard and Tarpenning.  They were engineers with an idea and skills.  Similar to Woz at Apple or the McDonalds brothers, they had an initial idea, founded a company and can be credited with initial technological success,.  But, the success the company is now known for is well beyond and not of their making.  The success of the modern company is due to the CEO now synonymous with the name."
"You sound exactly like every critic of PayPal, Roadster, Model S, Model X, Model 3, SpaceX, Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Starlink before they became a thing."

"> To think that deep neural nets are going to magically make FSD a reality is a deep misunderstanding of the technology and it's limitations.

"There's a difference between Tesla remaining at the forefront of the EV industry, and Tesla's stock continuing to grow, though.

What if FSD ultimately fails? What if Waymo beats them to the punch? They'll still be an excellent EV company, but the stock will take a monumental hit.

 What if Solar Roof fails? Or Megapack. Or Gigafactory 4 gets bogged down in beaurocratic bullshit, like so many are predicting?

The stock market does not reflect the success of companies like Tesla; it reflects their *perceived future success*. And that perception can change radically at the drop of a hat."
Reddit is weird. *shrug*
"Um. The robotaxi, will be empty when picking up passengers, so them having licenses is moot. The car has to get there somehow. Now you could fix that by having the car wait where it is for an other rider. But that is a huge limitation, and in large cities where morning traffic mostly flows in, and afternoon traffic flows out, this would fail to work well."
I think you are trying to make this rational.  It's not.
"Got Lane Departure Avoidance since I bought the car. Stop sign and red light warnings, object avoidance (like traffic cones), Sentry mode, dash cam save on honk, new voice commands, and more."
"> Part of it is surely fanaticism. But, some is also realistic. Look at what Tesla was prior to Musk,

I think this is the answer to is 'Are the people who fanatically defending Musk (are there people who do so fanatically?) *justified in doing so*?'  Yes of course, Musk did all that you laid out here.  My question still remains 'why do people bother to do it?  I own a tesla and I like it a lot, I know a bit of his backstory (I now know more thanks to you), yet I feel no particular impulse to defend Musk as a guy.  I'm still missing something here.

Are there Buffett fanatics?  Or folks who defend Wexner as 'the guy who invented lingerie'?"
"It's just about as accurate as the car visualizations you already have.  You know, where it can't decide if it's a car next to you, or a semi, or maybe two cars, or a spinning car, all within the span of five seconds?

The visualizations are the same way.  Are those tailights, or cones?  Is the traffic light green, or not any color at all?  Does the lane next to you have an arrow, or are you in the middle of two lanes?  It's just as bad as the traffic visualization.  Which is to say, it better not be the basis of any kind of actual self-driving tech, or Tesla is much farther away than even I would have guessed.  If it's just pretty visualizations for you to gawk at (which I suspect it is), then it is fine.  Not exactly bleeding edge, but good for eye candy."
There's nothing to indicate that AP is safer than humans.  Freeway accidents are already rare.
"Why?  It's the same tech and the same ""its only big until someone else has it"".  If you've solved one you've solved the other."
"For me it's their insistence on minimalism. I have to use an Apple TV at work, and it is supposed to work with another item via Bluetooth. However, if something else automatically links in first, persuading it to release it's first connection is a pain. And the scrolling on that remote! Agghh!"
"Ah yes, the completely copied and unoriginal infrared FaceID, 3D Touch, blazing fast A series processors, and market leading smartwatch.

"Sure, in short terms. But we’re talking massively long term here. Every single one of those issues you mentioned would be a drop in the ocean in terms of scale. Yes they can run into issues this quarter or 12 quarters from now. But those issues will be solved, and in the ultra long term, their business strategy is very sound.

The reason is because they don’t have competitors. That’s their long term moat. No one is doubling the entire world’s supply of batteries with 1 factory (with plans to double, triple, or even quadruple in the future). No one is planning on upgrading the world’s electrical infrastructure. No one is even planning on making solar roof products at a large scale, let alone able to do it. Other manufacturers are trying to make good EVs and are failing.

So yes they can run into issues 12 or 20 or 7 quarters from now, but by the 30th quarter, those issues would be solved. It’s like the Model 3 production, it looked horrible in Q1 and Q2 of 2018. But looking back, how much of those production problems affected Tesla today? Absolutely none.

That’s the beauty of long term investments. You don’t have to worry about temporary setbacks. As long as their long term strategy is sound it’s a good investment. And there’s no company that I can see (that isn’t already a monopoly) that has as sound of a long term strategy as Tesla."
"Really?

Millions of shares a day being bought and your best assessment is, irrational activity?"
">Got Lane Departure Avoidance

As does basically every other car in the last 3 to 5 years.  
The traffic light and stop sign warning are really cool although I'm not sure what they do. They only show the light or stop sign in the display, don't they?   
And honestly I'm not a big fan of cameras everywhere that are recording constantly. I hate it when I walk past Teslas at work and one after another turns on the lights. It kinda wants me to stick something over the cameras.  
Most cars simply have interior surveillance and honk when someone breaks in. It works just as well with the small difference that you won't get that many false alarms and I wouldn't be on dozens of USB Sticks."
"There are definitely Buffett guys, but not in this forum.  There are definitely Steve Jobs guys and Steve Wozniak guys (often verses each other).  There are even Richard Nixon guys out there in world, still defending his honor and trying to gain support for his legacy long after he died.

I think it is common to have passion for an idea or belief and for that idea to be personified by a famous figure.  By supporting and defending the individual, you gain support for your ideas and beliefs.  None of it is wrong, though it can go too far, as can many things where passion is involved."
"> Are the people who fanatically defending Musk (are there people who do so fanatically?) justified in doing so?

Yes.  Yes they are."
The car visualizations haven't been that bad in months. V10 fixed all of that.
I never claimed it was safer.
Maybe. I can see semis being easier. City traffic is nuts. Straight shot runs between metros to depots at town edges (as is often the case) could solve 80% of the economic issue (perhaps Intown short haul uses humans a while longer) with much less FSD sophistication.
"Apple gets a lot of hate for good and bad reasons.  

I think it’s undeniable that their software is amazing.  People get angry because of (1) the cult of fans, and (2) the hardware restrictions.  

The Apple product stack is also something that you need to fiddle with and configure to find a good value for an enthusiast.  There are value products and configurations, but a lot of haters just dismiss them off hand."
"At this price, yes.  People are buying the story.  I can't believe there is any analysis you are missing.  There has been a lot of out China recently too.  I've always thought that their exemption from partnerships was huge, possibly the single biggest piece of good news for Tesla in 2019, but it didn't move the needle."
"Millions of shares were being sold 8 months ago, was that rational? TSLA is one SEC violation away from plunging back into the abyss as we just saw in May 2019. The company’s underlying fundamentals have not changed in 8 months. So if the underlying fundamentals are the same at $188 then how can you justify $470?"
"I wasn't really thinking of (even animated) disagreement between people of good character.  I was more thinking of 'how *dare* you say Steve Jobs was a bad father!', which I've heard more than once.  This from folks who don't know Steve Jobs or much about him."

Actually they had a model s for testing at the fleet for the Bundestag/ federal government a while back but decided against it. Currently they have two Audi e-tron
Berlin is its own state.
Colombia is an independent state.
Well. I am French and live in Germany since 2003. let me put it mildly: what the fuck this is the end of the German world kind of shit!!! It is news like someone shot at a German pope or the Russians are marching in.
nope you are correct! also thanks for saving us a  click :)
Underrated comment
Only Berlin State
"~23 max. 

Its only for the Senate."
"Does that matter?

But anyways, I highly doubt any gouvernement official would choose a Tesla over any german brand.

I don't care if you think Teslas are x times better than whatever Audi or BMW have to offer. You're definetly not going to see Merkel in an american car"
"As Berlin is absolutely brankrupt, probably won't happen"
Imagine when the Cybertruck starts production!
"*Range: fifteen kilometers (fully charged)*

Edit because issa joke and I forgot the /s"
They're already here. What's inside youtube channel did a video on them
What’s an „ armoured Tesla‘s lol“?
"Given that Audi A8s with W12 engines (and 760s and S600s) are approved for government use, I doubt it's an emissions thing.

My money's on German industry support."
So you don't go and buy a 812 GTS for half a million euros.
"there are certain rules and features the car needs to have for example it needs to be able to be heated while the engine is turned off so for regular cars you basically need a preheater.

that is because the drivers will wait in the cars often so thats a feature they need just to give one example."
"Overall safety, and sensibility of information? Though based on privacy, I don't see how Tesla would fulfill that"
It’s Germany. They’re ok with it.
"Other cars do have these features and those are also concerning, though I imagine it is easier to defeat those features in other vehicles.

Not long until officials cars need to be sanitized to have possible threats removed just like phones and laptops."
This is on the state level not federal level. The only state deciding on this is Berlin.
No this is not for statevisits in the 80ies. State officials can get subsidies for what would be a company car but to qualify it needs to become the approved list. I think that’s to prevent misuse for something like a Lamborghini.
"German here. no, never seen this on an official car for a German state (Bundesland)"
> district of Colombia *if it was a state*
Nowhere near Berlin!
So is Oktoberfest
whoops I was on the phone. Autocorrect got me there
What? Sorry not sure what you are trying to say.
"Just to add some more information : 

The senate is the cabinet of the state government in Berlin."
"> Does that matter?

Yes! I was trying to see if number of sold cars makes any difference for Tesla really, or this is just another PR type of thing event.

I honestly dont know if government buy / lease 10 cars per year or 10000 (or any number in between)."
"Bullshit. Berlin has a higher debt compared to other german states but that doesn't mean it's bankrupt. Berlin's debt is 43% of GDP, now compare that to the US which has a debt of 96% of GDP."
Just imagine Cybertrucks with mounted Not-A-Flamethrowers
Cyber truck probably won't be road legal in Europe because the lack of pedestrian safety.
"Assuming the armor doesn't affect aerodynamics, I wouldn't expect it to have *that* huge of an effect.  Afterall, Teslas are already pretty heavy as it is.  That said, I have no idea how armor works with glass, and my Model 3 has *a lot* of glass."
"Weight only contributes to rolling friction, not drag. It doesn't affect range quite as much as aerodynamics does."
I think your annoyed about grammar or something? I changed it to Teslas
Exactly. US government cars are American cars. You'd never see the US President's official car being a Mercedes. This is a pretty big deal for showing support of green alternatives to put pressure on German car manufacturers to catch up.
Germany Gigafactory? Okay okay we'll allow it.
Something for philandering politicians to consider.
> district of state *if it was Columbia*
I'll drive this truck off a cliff before I ever go back to Berlin...
"Germans are religious about cars. About their cars. It is basically unimaginable for German officials to drive a non 100 pc German car. That would be political suicide. Like the US air force buying French aircraft.

Tesla achieving this because electricity is crazy."
How can you compare apples and pears?
Or not sold because it is too heavy to have any useful carrying capacity.
It'd also make more back during regen I assume.
"Sorry, I was trying to be funny, rather than annoyed... ah... LOL, I guess?"

"Oh man, can you imagine the President of the US having a Tesla as his or her official car? I mean, not *this* president. No one could imagine that. But the *next* one."
Same reason airbus did not even bother to bid on the new air force one contract.
>district of state if it was Columbia
"That’s just nonsense no politician would be chastised for driving a non German car. Not to mention political suicide.

Germany as a whole is not patriotic like you suggest. Just to drive that point home a bit. Our military just ordered 4 new frigates the contract was awarded to a Dutch company. Just to put your US/french aircraft example into perspective.

So no this is not a plot to keep politicians from political suicide.

Edit:I just did some more research into this because the list seems weird in the first place. A select number of state officials(the higher ups) are supplied with cars and drivers for their work. And those people get to chose from this list based on price and some options(which are required) for example heating while being stationary(driver often has to wait in the car) which was given as a reason why Tesla was added even though the leasing rate is very high(apparently the other companies on the list offer discounts for this usecase)"
Bankrupt means they can't pay their bills which is simply false. https://www.berlin.de/sen/finanzen/haushalt/haushaltsueberwachung/schuldentilgung/artikel.475316.php

Jeep is American.

I'm thinking Pence will go car shopping in Detroit. :-)
"Coincidentally, a large order (new generation of friggates) by the German Navy just went to a Dutch Company.

"It's hyperbolic but look at it this way:. There is no official list if cars the US president can use for transport, but unofficially it's always been American.  Optics are a part if the political game.

Looking this up the verify facts I noticed President Taft had an electric car - the 1909 Baker"
"true, wrong word. So which one is better in English?"
"Europe has a bunch of different drivers license categories.

The most commonly owned one is ""category B"" which is for driving normal cars.

This category has 2 limits. 

Limit 1: maximum of 9 seats including the drivers seat. If you want more seats you need a license of type D or D1. Which require additional driving and theory tests as well as different speed limits.

Limit 2: A max GVWR, without a trailer, of 3500kg (7700lb). If you want a higher GVWR you need a license category C (32 metric tons) or C1 (7.5 metric tons). Which once again require additional practical and theoretical exams. As well as lower general speed limits and restrictions on when you are allowed to drive it.


So if it weighs 3200kg empty it has a maximum carrying capacity of 300kg. Which is utterly useless.

2800kg empty means 700kg carrying capacity. Those 700kg include all cargo as well as any passengers.


It's why the F150 isn't sold in Europe. Cause why would you buy an F150 when a single cab ranger can carry just as much shit."

"They build that car specifically for the president like that’s not really the same usecase. The senate(cabinet) of the state government has a vehicle fleet for official use. They give the senators a list with preapproved cars which where compared for price and features. The president doesn‘t get a choice at all. 

Optics are definitely part of politics but not nearly to the extend suggested above. If we are talking like chancellor Merkel than perhaps people would be a bit dumbfounded when she would arrive somewhere in a Citroën but this is not federal government Berlin is a city state. Nobody cares. Most people don’t know who is the current senator for something specific."

"Yes the president does.  Read up on Obama's choice, it's an interesting look into what's involved."
"I forgot one more thing.

Driving a vehicle of category B or BE (same vehicle but with a trailer) professionally doesn't require any extra certification as long as you are inly transporting cargo and not people.

A vehicle of category C(1)(E) or D(1)(E) does require additional repeating certification. One part of which is a somewhat stringent health check-up."
"Yes, put that immersive audio system to good use!"
"This has already been publically requested, by none other than Neil deGrasse Tyson about 1 year ago. =)"
"I'd argue for one thing... keep the volume in all speakers at the current level and then louder in the direction desired. 

If something like this resulted in an overall decreased warning volume or only in a speaker that happened to be broken, that'd be bad."
"I'm surprised there isn't an official Tesla site that can collect these feature request and we could up vote to get the popular ones done. 

Tesla could market that too. Not only do our cars get better we listen to what owners want and push it out to them.

I have been keeping a whole list."
"Almost expanded on this in the main post, but an extension of the idea is that the volume of the warning is proportional to Tesla's assessment of the risk. Quieter sound for less danger, louder sound for more danger (probability of an accident occuring). A risky situation would typically increase and then decrease in danger over the course of any given event. Thus the sound would get louder as the chance of a collision increases, and then quieter as the danger subsides seconds (or tenths of a second) later."
"I know it’s not directly related, but when I had my Signature Model X, when drifting out of your lane, you felt a rumble (like you were driving on a rumble strip on the side of the road), and it really felt like it was coming from the side of the car that you were drifting on.  The Signature had many, many (many, many) issues, which is why I traded it in, but it’s one of the features I miss most.  On my new one, there is the ability to have it actively work to stay in the lane (you can feel the wheel pull you back into your lane when you drift), but I truly loved the rumble strip feeling.  I wish both could be available."
My wife's Hyundai does this and I love it.
"And change them to fart noises. The more intense farts the closer you get to the object. 

/s ...kinda"
"Instructions unclear, new fart noises will be provided in next update."
Doing this for the parking sensor chimes would be amazing too.
"I have a 2012 Chevy Volt and I think the beeps come from the side of the alarm (i.e. crossing a center line beeps come from the left speaker, crossing the shoulder line the beep comes from the right)."
I think you'd have a better chance of this getting to Elon's ears by tweeting it to him.
You should put this in moretesla too! Elon sometimes checks!
"Great idea, playing devils advocate...I wonder if this poses any kind of risk for accessibility if someone is deaf in one ear and unable to hear it well come one from one speaker instead of all.  They should make it, but as an option to enable instead of a default."
“Pull up! Pull up!”
That's actually a really cool idea
"Not all of us can hear well in all directions.

This is also why some cars have the visual indicators (over or including the sound ones).
We are not all good determining sound a direction is coming form.
But you are literally required by law (and physics) to see where light is coming from."
"Maybe have it be like, faded to that side, just in case the speakers don't work. Also, maybe make it like surround sound so you know exactly where it is."
"Directional notifications can cause problems with directional auditory stream processing and distraction, leading to confusion. I'm doing some research into this  currently, would love to see some hard specs for the Tesla audio set up with dimensions and dB values, azimuth positions etc."
What about the individuals that have bad hearing on such side of potential danger?
Great idea! But not good for all cases. I know some one who is deaf on right side. He might not understand the direction properly with this feature. May be Tesla should give this as a switch to enable and disable.
"idk if my brain can work fast enough to process all that information, would be interested to try though."
"WAIT A MINUTE!

does that mean I can have Dolby 7.1 surround sound in my car?"
amazing idea. love it!!
Make the system api open so people can implement things like this themselves. It can become a standard and new features can be built faster/cheaper
Yes this is a great idea!!
That is an absolutely brilliant feature that actually gets round the licensing restriction on blind spot assist that Mercedes owns
This has been suggested so many times it's a meme!
"There's Joe Mode, but they should make it so you can change the volume, but obviously setting a lower and upper limit."
"Could also have a visual cue in the form of a (possibly coloured) transparent arrow on the proximity display. The colour would depend on the perceived severity of the threat.

Would be really nice, too, if the audio and visual earnings could be activated for emergency vehicles approaching. I find myself having to do the ""Top Gun"" fighter pilot thing looking around for the ambulance/due/police vehicle."
"As long as this additional feature is additional and not to replace other cues.

I am 100% deaf in one ear and have no accurate perception of where a sound is coming from."
This is a famous one MKBHD and NDT offered it to Elon on Twitter. He acknowledge and approved the idea. Just a matter of time.
"I’d also like to know what triggered the warning in the first place. Most of my alerts are false ones but I can’t tell what caused them and the alert happens so fast I end up never knowing. 

I’d like to see a Log area that shows what happened, ideally with sentry footage. 

On a side note, I really would like to see advanced audio alerts for the blind spot. Right now all we have is the imminent crash alert and the visual blind spot information on the 3 is on the touchscreen, which is the wrong place to look when charging lanes. 

The best idea I’ve heard is to make the blinker noise sound a little different when there’s someone in your blind spot. This would give you some advanced warning without being annoying and could be something people could turn off in Settings if they really didn’t want it."
"I requested this idea here in 2014, they told me it was already implemented"
My Kia Niro EV does that with the lane departure audible warning. Beeps from the side at which you're leaving the lane.
"Just out of curiosity, if this feature had been implemented how many people do you think would’ve steered into the direction of the sound?"
"Sounds (mostly) like this feature request, which you can upvote and comment on here:

[https://moretesla.com/issues/ezesDUTYBjSBpRL980z5](https://moretesla.com/issues/ezesDUTYBjSBpRL980z5)"
Volvo trucks do it so surely a Tesla should
You could have the speaker pop in the direction of danger. The pop always seems to make me jump when it happens.
Joe mode- improvement
Let's make this optional plz.  I only have 1 ear that works and wouldn't hear the warnings half the time. :-)
"Some sci-fi books experiment with the idea of auditory simulation. For example, if you're in a space battle and you're being shot at, it'll simulate the ""pew pew pew"" sound. If a ship explodes near you, it'll simulate the sound and feel of an explosion, proportional to the distance."
Would suck for me as I'm deaf on one ear :(
 No. It’s visible on the screen and that’s plenty.
"true, this technology already exists, there are speakers that can only be heard on one direction"
"Make it a $5,000 option. The option to make alert less loud for useless things another $3, 000."
Just a quick counter argument I have seen last time this was requested which to me makes sense. What if a speaker fails? Its better to hear an important notification from all speakers than a specific speaker and risk the chance of missing an alert.
[removed]
"Yeah, but now someone important like Lorde wants it."
"I suspect someone has a patent on that. I've found that when Tesla doesn't do something relatively obvious, that is the reason."
"Maybe play on the others more quietly (it's loud enough!), but imo, better just to detect if a speaker is broken and then react accordingly. I want maximum or near maximum stereo usage, especially if it needs to play on two speakers simultaneously (e.g: back and right speaker)."
"This is also helpful because of people who are hearing impaired. My dad's left ear is almost deaf from a work accident, so a warning from only the left could be hard to hear.

Edit: btw his accident was in a police training scenario and a flashbang thrown by one of his companions bounced back next to his ear. Also years of shooting firearms have not done good for his ears, wear protection!"
They already had that glitch but I don't know if it's fixed or still there.  Navigation prompts used to come from the driver front speaker and you wouldn't hear them if the audio was balanced away from it.  I don't use nav audio even with the new voice so I don't know if it's fixed.
"If you have a broken speaker and you’re actively using the audio system to get your directional sensor warnings and alerts, then that’s on you to get fixed."
This is the correct answer for us single side deaf people who can’t tell where sounds come from and have extreme difficulty hearing sounds from our deaf side.
"Either that or have it be a config tied to the driver profile. Maybe 3 options; all speakers, all speakers + directional at an elevated volume, or exclusively directional."
I don't think Joe would like this...
"I've worked with a few companies that used UserVoice and it works well.  
[https://www.uservoice.com/](https://www.uservoice.com/)

It would be cool if Tesla had this set up. People post ideas, vote on ideas that are good, and the company tries to implement the ideas with the highest number of votes.

The downside is that with how large the Tesla user base has become, there will likely be thousands of feature requests that need to be sorted through. Tesla would probably need a team of 2 to 3 people to dedicate their time to managing this system."
teslamotorclub.com is a good site for exactly what you are describing. There’s also fair amount of problem solving and basic information being shared. Cheers
Some kind of place where each post is a feature request and people vote up/down the request. There could even be comments on each request.
Reddit+upvotes?
"Working on that [here.](https://teslaideas.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Directional-Warning-Sounds-from-Speakers/389033-46665)  (Also that’s this idea). 

We are also tracking which ideas have been [acknowledged by Elon.](https://teslaideas.ideascale.com/a/ideas/tag/tags/acknowledged)"
Human ears are more sensitive to changes in pitch than changes in volume. So maybe replace volume changes with pitch changes?
"I like the idea of adjusting the volume, but I was actually thinking of something more like a Geiger Counter: Slower ""dings"" for ""potential warning"", but rapid ""dings"" for ""imminent danger!"""
Use noise cancelling technology  to remove wind noise.
What do you mean by signature model x? Like did Elon musk sign it?
"“I put the art in fart”

"My 2017 Chrysler Pacifica does this.  As you approach something, the proximity sensors will beep on the side of the car where they are coming from (front left, rear right, etc). The closer you get to them the louder they get.  Multiple speakers will play if you get multiple alerts."
"""You’ll also hear three beeps or, if your vehicle has a Safety Alert Seat, **you’ll feel three seat pulses on the left or right side of the seat.** These alerts depend on how you’ve set your vehicle preferences. ""

"I'm a nobody on Twitter, and Reddit's democratic vote system has a greater chance to get this idea out to more people who would then either tweet him or let him know directly."
"***Driving is easy, just put the car in autopilot!***"
"I agree, louder on one side and softer on all others would be a better implementation."
"How is an alarm that indicates the direction of the problem more confusing than a general alarm that might as well mean ""You're about to die but you don't know where it's coming from because this is a general alarm beep that is used for everything and nothing is getting displayed on the screen because you'll be dead long before you get a chance to process what you're reading!  Good luck with the afterlife LULZ!"""

"I think even a single ear has a degree of directional perception? It wouldn't be any worse for him anyway, since he'd still hear the sound through his remaining ear."
"If someone honks their horn from the left, you would instinctively look left. We're wired up to already think that way I reckon."
"Directional hearing is one of the fastest and most accurate senses we possess. If someone yells your name you will always look in that person's direction no matter where they are. 

If you don't believe me watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUDTlvagjJA) with headphones (that is important because you need to isolate the audio both ears receive for it to work)"
"Not 7, but 5."
You're the only person here who's saying that. Source?
Found the Porsche owner
"You can have it from all speakers, but louder from some than others."
"You're more likely to get hit by a red car than to have a speaker fail in a Tesla. You're more likely to have a battery fire that to have a eowaker fail AND the exact speaker that a detrimental warning is supposed to come from.

Everyone else in the history of driving didn't have these warnings.

The benefits of direction auditory warning outweighs the risk."
Microphone could verify the speaker didn't fail and if it did resend through all speakers.
This is a good point. Although I really like OP’s suggestion.
"Most blown speakers still make noise, it just isn't the right noise"
"Make it an option **and** allow for testing, which could also be an option when the driver is activating the car."
"BMw has this feature. With so many speakers this isn’t even an issue. 

I’m pretty sure BMW has had it since 2004. 360 sound will let you know where the parking sensors or car is coming from."
This comment is confusing.
Bad bot
"> Good use? In who’s eyes 👀? There no way this can be used in good ways, it’s pretty obnoxious if you ask me 🤗, personally rerouting sound is pretty terrible for the motor company producing it. Don’t make fun of them by removing their products, leave it be, don’t give the middle finger to Tesla 🤣

Are you a bot?"
He’s busy maintaining Tegridy.
How evil if patents can be used for something this simple/obvious.
"Probably this was Neil deGrasse Tyson’s idea all along:

1. Patent a feature,
2. Publicly demand the feature,
3. ???
4. Profit!

That dastardly NdT!"
"I doubt it, both of the cars (neither Teslas YET) we own do it for the parking sensors."
"More likely it's a legal regulatory reason.... 

Imagine if the chip controlling the speakers had some kind of error or one just blew out, so you weren't getting alerts. 

It would make insurance claims a nightmare for a start."
"I applaud your father for his service, maybe the could make an option for this directional thing? Then name it after him like joe mode?"
"Ah! Someone else who doesn't use nav audio! I was beginning to think I was alone. ""No, my car isn't broken, I just don't want it talking at me""."
"Yeah, I just kinda use my mirrors instead. I’d be completely happy if you could shut the warnings 100% off."
"So make it a toggle under safety and security for ""Directional Audio Warnings"" so that you can enable/disable where needed"
"I have a UserVoice forum for a product with several million users and, when well moderated, it works very well. Idea moderation takes about 5% of the time of one person (we get about three new ideas per week, half of them are duplicates). We don't moderate comments unless they are reported.
The problem with Tesla is that most idea will come up at a time when you are not supposed to be using a web site."
They'd just ignore it.  Elon acknowledged this directional audio request long ago but it never came.  Same with app store and so on.

"I like that too, but there'll be some inherent latency between each ding, at least for the slower ones (or a fast one after a slow one). Volume is automatically zero latency."
"Now you've got me wondering if Bose would ever partner with Tesla to enhance their sound systems, or if they would take the Sony route and make their own EV."
"The problem with noise cancelling and entire space is the destructive interference needed to damped the sound for the entire volume would be almost impossible to achieve, and any attempt to do so would just create regions of dampened sound and amplified sound.

Noise cancelling works in headphones because, for the most part, the sound waves are travelling in a single direction and are fairly the same throughout the volume inside the ear cup. In a car, you have all kinds of different sound waves being created from every surface inside the vehicle. These waves interact to create complex waves that would be highly improbable to be able to accuratelly replicate in an opposite phase. 

You may be able to have it so the driver can tune a space of cancelled noise around their head by playing around with settings, but it would also probably make things worse for everyone else in the car"
They sell rubber strips fro the glass roof and that kills about 10db if I am not wrong
Special Early model S and X vehicles are known as signature models
"Yeah no reason to delete your Reddit post, but he fairy regularly responds to random people on Twitter, so you certainly have a chance there."
"Because localisation of sounds isn't super straightforward, there are loads of variables that effect localisation and confusion. The type of notification (frequency and dB components) , the acoustics of the space you're in, audio masking etc. There's a thing called 'the cone of confusion' that's causing some issues in VR and similiar applications atm where a user can't accurately locate a sound that's coming from behind, it often sounds like it's coming from above or the side.

And in a life threatening situation like the one you're describing, it may be better to have a general 'take action now' notification rather than spending precious time trying to locate threat and relative position. Ambulance sirens are a good example of that, they're notoriously difficult to localise, but when you hear one you know to stop and give way. 

There's lots of research being done in that area right now, so something like this will probably be developed in the future."
"Aye there it is, someone says anything you disagree with, immediate iamverysmart, good man you've achieved standard reddit response.

Yep I'm aware of sound localisation in parking sensors. Different context, often different sounds.
Main point being, if you're going to implement a feature like an advanced auditory warning system and claim it leads to improved safety, your evidence and testing needs to be rigours.as.hell, cause that's an important claim. Especially when those types of systems can lead to distraction.

As I said, there's ongoing research being done and I think it would be a good system if it could be implemented properly. Pointing out an issue with something isn't saying that the thing is bad."
"Just playing DA here 

I’d still argue with a directional alert would be more of a party trick than making the car safer. If said danger is apparent on the left side and the left speakers play this warning - what’s the next plan of action? What would be the result if a directional alert was available ?"
"I am not sure how it feels to be deaf on one side. May be you are correct. I would still say it should be an option, rather than the default option.
Edit: one thing I just remembered, whenever I call him(the one side deaf guy) from a particular direction, he never hears him. So I think better to have this as an option."
I think I need to see a therapist cause I have little faith in myself to not fuck that situation up either hahah.
https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/1060881947105337345?s=19
"Or just have directional alerts as an option that can be disabled. So, if you're deaf in one ear, a speaker fails, or if you just dislike the directional alerts, you can just toggle them off."
That's what my '14 Jeep Cherokee does when backing out of a parking spot. This is called rear cross traffic alert. The sound comes from all speakers but is louder in the direction of the incoming vehicle. That should be standard on all vehicles.
"Directional sound is better done with subtle timing than with volume (though volume plays a part. 

A sound coming from the right hits your right ear before your left ear."
"I think the microphone could be used to detect that in real time. Basically, the received data must correlate to an earlier recorded test. (Or possibly even some more advanced mechanism not requiring a test recording.)"
It might get complicated to implement this. You would have to make it loud enough to still be able to hear the important notification yet still be able to perceive direction. That might defeat the purpose. I see small gain from it being directional and a bigger gain in redundancy of the alarm.
"it seems to be one, indeed"
Yah yah yah!
Not to mention something that could enhance safety
Penalty because the manufacturer owns the patent or licensed it.
Those beeps are not regulated since parking sensors are not mandated by law or regulation. And some other cars do it.

Do you want an alarm that will 100% confuse you because you are not aware of what the problem is or would you rather an alarm that 80% of the time will tell you what direction needs your attention and just confuse you like the first instance the other 20% of the time.

You're basically saying don't ever go into surgery because they don't have a 100% recovery rate.  Something is better than nothing here."
The idea is that it draws your attention in that direction.
"Ah nice one! Elon didn't say 'OK', but hopefully, it's safe to assume he saw it?"
That would for sure work but in my opinion Tesla needs to limit the number of toggle settings. It can get out of hand really quick.
"That's not a good system, if the speaker has failed and you don't know that yet, you will miss the alarm."
I think the counter-argument would be that it would disincentivize research and development into safety technology.
"They are from different companies (and I not owned by same parent company or anything), but I guess they could both have licensed it"
Model S and X have 2 nav displays and the instrument cluster us so much better than the center display.  It makes audio redundant.  Plus the old nav voice was so bad it was hard to tolerate
"Not necessarily. I use it mostly for the battery estimation of my route. If I am using it for directions, I can look at it ahead of time when better to versus when the voice command prompts me right before I need to do something."
"Indeed. When something gets ""ignored"" it is probably for a good reason, like an existing patent. In most cases they are very responsive."
But there isn't one that has a large user base and Tesla isn't going to care.
Wife disapproves.
Oh
"The figures don't make sense, there's no hardline percentage for confusion rates, I can only talk about the likelihood of auditory confusion. 

I'm not saying that, I'm simply saying, that idea could (maybe should) be implemented but there are a bunch of psychoacoustic considerations to make in the design and application of such a system, it isn't that straightforward and at the end of the day you don't want to add a system that increases risk or user cognitive load (in normal day to day use).

It's not a bad idea, it's an interesting area too, sound is hugely underappreciated in design."
"So it doesn’t truly make the car nor the occupants safer and in addition the drivers should already have a responsibility to have a decent level of alertness. 

If I understand correctly this is somewhat implemented through visualization as oppose to hearing where some may not have the ability to. Today is there is detected danger by the car lanes/ oncoming car would turn red as a result. 

As the OP mentioned this would possibly help with a rear car approaching fast but I’d be more interested to know if the difference in hardware can make such adjustments for users. 

Not against this “feature” just not seeing the true value."
"Yup! Happy to dig it up for you. I seem to recall him mentioning it in an interview a while back that this was a good idea. But my Google-Fu isn't retuning any results on that search. That said, I think it's safe to say he saw it given the people around it. :)"
"Yeah I could see that being problematic. I dont have a tesla, just a big fan, so I am blissfully unaware of how much UI clutter there is/could be."
I get the sentiment for the public but I gotta say Id love an overly customizable UI. Linux vs Apple. I don’t agree with all of Tesla’s UO decisions and would love to be able to root and change it somehow.
"True, I was actually envisioning that it would still play quietly-ish over the other speakers, the failed speaker would just make no noise, of course."
"A failed speaker would have a change in resistance values.

I wonder if, like for the headlights, the car could detect this and default back to ""all speakers"" for the warning...

Also, someone made the valid point below that there's more than 1 speaker in any direction, so the likelihood that all of them would have failed is quite small. It is actually more likely that \*all\* speakers fail at once."
"Isn’t there more than one speaker in each direction? If my ford has 16, I’d imagine Tesla’s have at least 20 standard"
"That is a valid argument but not for this. No R&D is needed to find up with ideas this simple. I thought of it days after I bought my first car with parking sensors, no R&D needed. Patents should be used to protect directed research, not random spontaneous ideas."
"That's very common in the auto industry. Almost everything is patented, so they have ""patent clearing teams"" where they exchange patent licenses. Tesla has something like that with their free patents, they can't be sued for patent infringement by a company that's using one of their patents, so most likely it's not an auto company that owns they patent but a third party, and the third party is being greedy"
I think Tesla would care if it had genuinely good ideas and was well moderated. They made joe mode because one person complained about the alerts waking up his baby.
"> So it doesn’t truly make the car nor the occupants safer and in addition the drivers should already have a responsibility to have a decent level of alertness.

This is a confusing statement at minimum. You're acting as if people are robots and can be constantly vigilant at all times. Blind-spot warning lights, TACC, and several other features in cars prove this is not the case and having direction-based alerts to focus on imminent threats is another safety feature, whether you're paying attention or sleeping at the wheel.

>If I understand correctly this is somewhat implemented through visualization as oppose to hearing where some may not have the ability to.

Yes that's exactly what you should do - look to your screen, shift focus (ocularly and mentally), identify a threat or read a warning and then finally act, instead of being audibly alerted to where the problem is when you may have *less than seconds to act*."
"That isn't true at all. Even a very alert driver has to focus his or her attention in one direction at a time.  Anything that adds some extra awareness can provide a definite improvement to safety.  the visualization is cool in appearance, but isn't very useful in practice. You aren't staring down at the display, you are watching the road, primarily ahead of you.  If you could know about hazard approaching from one side before you actually visually see it, the safety benefits could be enormous. What if something is coming from the right, but the next side you will be checking is your left? An alert that draws your attention to the right could save well more than enough time for the average driver to react to a situation that they would have otherwise not seen in time."
"Here, have the majority of my gold award ;)"
"I hope one day they add some sort of advanced/enthusiast settings. Much like developer settings on Android, make it hidden by default and require something unusual like tapping 10 times on the version number to enable them so only those who want them will ever find them."
" I'm with you, can I just ssh in and edit my ~/config/tesla/.alerts file? Mostly joking, I get not wanting to overwhelm the average user, but I'm not a fan of eliminating configuration options entirely just to keep the UI clean. Hide them if you have to, but let me get to them if I want."
Is UO the latest UI/UX buzzword or is that a typo?
"Oh boy - the fallacies here. 

Again party trick versus actual return. Especially for something drivers are obligated to do. 

Could this be done,  sure,  but is it worth the work is the question?

Only can be determined by Tesla’s Engineers at this point. 

Bring on the “bird box” feature 🥴"
"Huzzah! Thank you, kind internet stranger!"
Or a custom skins option at least like back in the Winamp days
Typo
"> Oh boy - the fallacies here. 

Ironic given the number of fallacies in your statements:

[Proof\_by\_assertion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_assertion)

[Argument\_from\_incredulity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_incredulity)

[Appeal to ridicule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_ridicule)

That's just a start...

Anyways, it's not hard to imagine how even a vigilant driver could miss something happening in one direction while they are scanning elsewhere.  Especially when you consider the unforeseen circumstances that can occur over millions of miles driven.

A directional, audible alert could help people react faster than rescanning their surroundings or changing context to look at the screen first.  If it improves safety, some effort is worth it.  No need to get so upset about it."
"If I heard a warning sound to my right rear, I will be more responsive to the direction of danger than looking down at my screen first to then find out the direction...

And if that doesn’t work *for you*, [then...](https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/erw8lq/_/ff6llfz/?context=1)"

"I just talked to a friend of mine who used to drive semis for a living. He said that he could expect to reach 60 mph with a full load in about *90 seconds*. However, he knew how to speed-shift, so he was faster than average."
"So based on 500 mile range and less that 2kWh per mile means the battery is less than 1,000 kWh... I am guessing it will be around 900..."
What were the numbers before?
"Reverse now, huh?"
I'm still curious how these beasts are going to be recharged...
I don't think there's any new information here and nothing has changed.
"2kwh a mile, 500 mile range. So 1000 kwh battery. They could build 20 model 3s, which make 10k each margin or so. This won't see real production until they have battery surplus."
Still confused how a semi is 150K while an X is 100K.  I would have expected the X to cost way less than it currently does.
"Need a Tesla RV 

all these new RV concepts out there

https://newatlas.com/outdoors/camper-concepts-preview-rv-life-2020s/"
"I'm confused, what's new? All these specs have been there since the unveil."
Telsa Semi makes it reasonable for large cities to ban diesel trucks from within city limits. Air quality and health benefits will be enormous.
I love how the first reservation form input field is “quantity” haha I’ll take 2
"I tried to find a 0-60 time for a standard semi, here's the best I could find lol

>In my US Xpress Freightliner with a Detroit 60 series Automatic, hauling Full gross 80,000 lbs i can do 0-60 in about 2-3 miles if i remember correctly so about 5 minutes"
"Here's the conundrum with the Semi.

The truck is limited to 500 miles, but you probably want to run the battery from 10% to 80%, so you get 0.7 x 500 = 350 miles.

The driver is limited to 7.5 hours of driving out of every eight hours (mandatory 30 minute break), during which the new mega-chargers are targeted to be able to dump in enough electrons to get you back up to 80%.

So, 350 miles in 7.5 hours means you can average 46 miles per hour to time running out of driving hours run when the truck hits 10% remaining.

BUT...

The truck is QUICK, so it should be able to average higher than 46 MPH..

AND

Self driving reduces fatigue, as does not having to change gears, as does not have to worry about holding up traffic or dealing with stopping, so maybe the authorities will enable a waiver for the driving rules if someone is driving a Tesla semi.

I think where a company does a lot of runs between two locations within 300 miles, having destination charging will make the Tesla Semi a no-brainer.  Long haul may be more difficult...

EDIT:  thanks everyone for clarifying the rules in the United States, and SoC stuff.  Here in Australia I can get three Mazda three’s for the price of a model three, so not an owner.

5% to 90% over full eight hours = 53.13 MPH.

Pretty close to your notional 55 mph “limit”"
I hope Tesla makes a box truck next. Could probably just modify the cybertruck for the front end of it. If not a box truck at least a work van. I’m not sure but I feel like that category could be even more profitable than the semi. I feel like I see more vans and box trucks in my area than semis. Could be wrong though.
What was it before the update?
That’s good news you can reverse now. I was wondering how they were going to go backwards
So 500 mile range at 2kWh/mi with a buffer to prevent running it empty could mean a 1.21gWh pack. GREAT SCOTT!
This is the real CyberTruck.

"I've noticed that the Semi only linked from the menu for

* USA
* Canada
* UK
* Netherlands
* Norway

Are those the only countries they intend to sell them? The Cybertruck is scheduled to be release later and it's listen on pretty much all the language pages. Also interesting: China is the only language hosted under it's own domain."
What was it before that?
"Looking at the pictures with the trailer, does anyone know how the truck will turn with the trailer so close to the cab?"
"How did they change it? It always said ""Badass Peformance"""
Is that heading meant to say ‘Reserve Now’?  Or has Tesla invented a new way of going backward? Wow!
"Same drag coefficient as a Bugatti Chiron , impressive !"
"Ok. I'm still not seeing the mathematical savings here. Can someone fill me in because I just have googly helping me.  
.   
1.9kWh/mi means 950kWh for 500 miles. Using supercharger prices ($0.28/kwh) would yield $0.53/mi. That's $265 to go 500 miles. Diesel is $3/gal and they get conservatively 5mpg (average says 6.5mpg) fully loaded. That's $300 (average says $230) to go 500 miles.  The cost per mile is roughly the same"
Something that just popped into my head is that truck stops will be a great place to setup battery swap infrastructure for trucks. Either for super chargers or for actual swapping. Truckers can only drive 8-12 hours a day so you really just need like 800 miles of range at fully loaded and you’ll be fine for truck drivers. They can drive to their daily limit and park and swap batteries or charge up. It’s really an ideal use case for electric.
"I feel like for semis how good the tesla semi's ability to brake would be more important factor to know.

I don't think for semis 0-60 is THAT important. But being able to safely brake to prevent accidents and etc will be more of make it break it deal for me"
">**<2kWh a mile**

What were we predicting at the time? 1kWh/mile? I don't remember.

500\*2kWh = 1MWh pack = $100,000 just for the pack itself, $60,000 for the 300-mile version. Model 3 drive units cost $500-1000 or something, each. So the rest of the truck costs less than \~$75,000. 

I guess vertical integration pays off."
Faster than my nissan versa.
At which speed did elon say that the Semi has the claimed range?
Can't wait to see one show up at a drag strip for luls
It’s a good thing they added a reverse now
"Could someone post screenshots, the Tesla website redirects because I'm in Australia and its a real pain in the ass!!"
"Battery swap coming back to be able to charge these beasts? They already have the technology in place. 

Hard to install multiple 'megachargers' due to the cost of transformers and all. 

Thoughts?"
It’s a good thing they added a reverse now
Does anyone know where these will be supercharged?  I assume you can’t just go to a regular supercharger station?
"""Reverse now!"" literally had my picture a button where you can slam it to reverse at any point in time.  Activating the flux capacitor of course...."
I think the Formula Stusents race car for this year at my uni coefficient of drag is .36. Crazy :p
"Interestingly enough the Canadian website says 0-100 kmh in 25s even though 60mph is 100kmh.

Also of note the US prices of 150k/180k translating to 180k/230k CAD are a discount since 150k is 194853 cad and 180k is 233824 CAD but that's not really important since they aren't official prices.

EDIT: I guess my math was wrong, 100kmh is 62.13mph so I guess that makes up for the additional 5 seconds."
Is this a new addition to the Tesla website?
"How much range with an 80,000 lb load?"
It didn't have reverse before???
You think the cybertruck will get quad motors?
Weren't they supposed to be delivering thousands of them by now according to Elon's timeline?
"For comparison, the Daimler eCascadia web page quotes 550kw-hr battery to achieve 250 miles of range, or about 2.2kw-hr per mile.  The medium duty eM2 106 bobtail quotes 325kw-hr battery for 230 miles of range, or about 1.4 kw-hr per mile.  Of course, these are both parts bin prototypes and won't reflect the actual production units performance when they are released.  But it does give and idea of what can be achieved with a simple parts bin build of some prototypes."
"I’m not saying it isn’t valuable. My cousin drives trucks, and picking up speed is a pain when he is hauling a load. 

But, no extra resources went into increasing the acceleration, acceleration is a byproduct of electric motors. 

End users will not be seeing the acceleration in their bottom line price tag."
Let’s be honest - the drivers want autonomy so they can watch movies while driving :0
"> Reverse Now

What, they didn't have reverse previously?!??!  /s"
80k load? In pounds... They're describing it as having an 80 kilopound load? Really.
For me it’s the autonomy I think could change the sector forever
But where are the pedestrian crumple zones & airbags?!
Reserved one! Jk
"That's all well and good, but the weight of the truck is still a problem. Until they slim her down to the same weight as a conventional truck it's just not going to be worth it for companies to be buying these"
So 0-60 in 20 seconds is badass? What is the normal acceleration for an average semi? It sounds like it's still annoying to be stuck behind one at a red light.
[deleted]
"This needs to be closer to the top. 
5 minutes is way too long for level ground acceleration. 
Source: am truck driver."
How do truckers speed shift?  Clutchless upshifts snagging the gear when revs match??
"As a former semi driver. I think everyone speedshifts on big trucks. I had to clutch shift in my school for driving. It is so tedious it is amazing. 

Speed shifting a bit truck is easy also."
There is also the the fact these trucks have more than 10 gears usually. Shifting down and up all the time in traffic must be a royal PITA. The Tesla Semi will not have that problem.
"Mine takes about 3 min or a bit more to get to 60. Its a bit underpowered though, I must admit. Honestly 0-60 time is meaningless to me. When I am in the city I am thinking more about drivers than speed. I typically stay about 5 MPH under prevailing speed to be safe. If my truck hit someone, it will most likely kill them, and I don't want that so slow is fine. My industry (vocational) will never be electric. On a good day I only burn 200 gallons of fuel."
That would be 9 to 12 battery packs. Battery investor day is going to be interesting...
"But Elon also said it could potentially be more than 500 miles, so maybe still 1MWh?"
"At current prices, that is over a $100k for the battery alone. Unless you swap out the battery and don’t own it, the initial pricing seems unrealistically low."
"Im imagining using a semi truck as a backup battery for an building, can power several house with that for days."
"I thought <2kwh/mile was with the load and the full range was without a load. In other words “range will vary widely because that’s what range does when you tow heavy stuff, but we never expect consumption to exceed 2kwh per mile, even under the heaviest load”"
"> less that 2kWh per mile

Only in reverse tho."
[The exact same. It's been there literally since 2017.](https://web.archive.org/web/20171201060201/https://www.tesla.com/semi/)
"You couldn’t reverse now, you had to wait until later"
Going backwards is DLC. It’s called the “EA Model”
"Reserve now\*, didn't catch that if a mod wants to fix please do! u/110110 **?**"
"> Reverse now, huh?

beeeep beeeep beeeep beeeep beeeep"
"Megachargers, apparently. They currently use like 4SCs in parallel, but there has been talk of end-to-end liquid-cooled 1MW rated chargers specifically for trucks that would be backed by Megapacks + Solar..."
I’m envisioning businesses investing in charging infrastructure at drop points and only running them on certain routes that have been set up to accommodate. They will use the cost savings to slowly expand. Tesla will likely create dedicated charging at existing and new locations as well.
"A lot of the early reservations seem to be for shorter haul situations like grocery stores running trucks from a regional warehouse to the stores.

They can probably install charging infrastructure at the warehouses (probably part of a package deal with Tesla for buying the trucks) and recharge each night."
I'm sure there are plenty of truck stops in the US at least that would deal with Tesla to put in new chargers.
"At charges in their yards. These are day trucks.

Over the road comes later."
Probably 5 simultaneous Superchargers
These would only be for local/city runs at first.  It's not economical for long haul trucking.
Their net profit margin for 2019 Q3 was 2.27%
"Im pretty sure the standard range M3 does not make 10k margin. How much it makes? Hard to know but 10k would be astronomical for the cheapest model, maybe if you buy FSD and count it as pure profit."
"500 mile range is probably without a load. That’s why they worded the efficiency number so vaguely, because what you’re towing can vary so widely. “Less than 2kwh/mile”. The heavier the load, the lower the range, the closer you get to 2kwh/mile."
The X is *complicated*. They'll be making the Semi as simple and straightforward as it can be.
Good question. They must be expecting batteries to become aloe cheaper and soon.
"Well, which one has complicated ""falcon wing"" back doors and which does not?"
Long Range Model X is ~$84k now a days.
Because They Can. I’m sure the X is a very profitable car (though likely not as profitable as the less-complex S).
Luxury
"Batteries are expensive... Relative to a car. Batteries aren't expensive relative to a Semi.

Assuming $120/kwh (conservative).

2kwh *300 mi *$120 = $72k battery
+$80k for vehicle manufacturing
100kwh * $120 = $12k battery
+$80k for vehicle manufacturing

The X is both expensive to produce (lots of hand assembly).  Both semi and X are somewhat bespoke vehicles.

The next point is that X helps Tesla profitability directly. Semi will never sell in large enough numbers to swing profit margins like the 3 or Y. What Semi, like T Energy does is create massive demand for their cells and that gives the 3 and Y economies of scale for their batteries.

As the economies of scale drive down battery prices then Tesla can start turning huge profits on Semi. But with batteries being a small part of the X price, reducing battery prices isn't all that important like it is on 3.

The 3 is like 25% battery cost. If they could cut that in half without being forced to drop prices that is an extra 10% profit margin."
Puhrooooofiiit! Which is fine by me. Hard to start an automobile company.
I just want a cyber truck that looks like a class b van. I'll handle the rest.
I second this.
"I still think a Tesla semi based RV would be mistake, but looking at some of those concepts gives some idea as to what Tesla could do if it wanted to. Myself, I'd like them to do something like the GMC motorhome of the 70s. Dual rear model 3 motors. Double length battery pack. Roof covered in solar, with the extending awning providing more. Team up with Rymer for the fitting out..... bicycle garage behind full size bed over the motors. Properly insulated body, with heat recovery ventilation system for Winter camping."
Pretty sure you can do a full electric RV and run 100% off solar if traveling less than 400 miles every 4 days.  I'm surprised they don't have them yet because it seems perfect for convenience even if the extra rich wanted one with an engine so they never have to plug it in.
"I wonder how much power a solar-roofed RV could make... Currently Tesla does not have the technology to use vehicle batteries to power a house (have to buy separate power walls), but in an RV you’d obviously be running off the batteries."
"That is what i am saying.  Take the semi, drag out the back 2 axels to 40ish feet.  use the battery for powertrain and to run the camper.  line the roof top with solar with 2 slide out solid solar awnings when parked.  You would have 1 top of the line Green RV. no generators needed. peace and quiet and all the power you need to get up a 6% highway grade. When FSD comes out you can go to sleep and wake up in a new camp ground."
I need a Tesla rv with full self driving and I can sit in the back and chill on the couch doing road trips
"Give me an EV medium duty truck (30,000lb GVMR) with 4x4 for an expedition truck (https://www.globalxvehicles.com/)."
"Yup, I always thought the RV lifestyle was impractical these days, but I'm stoked for the next 10-15 years."
A semi based RV will come for sure. RV are pretty much all after market mods of existing vehicles of all sizes by specialized companies. It won't be made by Tesla though.
A few hundred thousand subscribers to the subreddit?
Tesla Semi is faar to big for cities isn't it?
Diesel burns cleaner than gas... I don't see cities banning ICE trucks any time soon.
If you’re a company serious about converting you’re probably converting your whole fleet or at least a large number of vehicles.
DHL reserved 70 AFAIK
About 90 seconds. 5 minutes is horribly incorrect.
"Way too many variables, but that truck is insanely slow or his memory is really bad.  
   
With a full load of Pepsi I used to be able to get to highway speed (55mph) in I’d guess 30-40 seconds.  If it took 5 minutes to get up to 60mph every semi getting on a Texas freeway would cause a near shutdown."
So... 20sec vs 5min... Holy shit.
"That's definitely not true, I've riden in fully loaded semis before it can't be much longer than 30s (at least for the 16L Volvos)"
"10, if there’s an EV behind me."
The math on 5 minutes is saying 2.5 miles at 30mph average but in acceleration you would get to 30 far faster than from 30 to 60 because of the quadratic function for kinetic energy so the average speed would be higher.
"It's really not 10%-80%. It's more like 5%-90%. The only thing bad about being at low SoC is *leaving it* at low SoC, much like with high SoC. If you start charging as soon as you hit 5%, there's no downside. And Tesla's official stance on maximum everyday charge level is 90%. Hasn't been 80% in years, if it ever was."
"A driver can drive a full 8 hours before having to stop for the 30-minute break. Just wanted to clear that up. 

Respect truck drivers, and don't ban them from your towns."
You do realize that a normal modern truck comes with traffic jam assist and traffic aware cruise control.
"> I think where a company does a lot of runs between two locations within 300 miles, having destination charging will make the Tesla Semi a no-brainer.

That will depend on how much downtime the trucks have. If it's short then adding 1MW+ capacity for every ~8 trucks will be hard in a bunch of sites. Tesla will probably try to have a complementary product of solar panels and battery modules to add to those type of sites."
"Considering this is targeted at the huge day truck market, you're overthinking this.

These trucks will be in a yard every night. Think grocery distribution, etc.

Over the road, along with the million dollar charging issue, comes later."
A 30 minute break sounds perfect for adding a bunch more range. Pretty sure that's enough to let you travel at 55 mph or higher for your entire shift!
"Work vans are a tough market though:

Lots of good value ICE alternatives as well as an area where traditional manufacturers have already implemented EVs successfully within their own model range (drove past my local council’s vehicle compound yesterday and they had electric vans charging up).

Not saying Tesla wouldn’t find some value to add, just that it’s non-trivial."
They should make a day cab semi model and an unfinished chassis model for truck builders to complete.
"I love the joke, but unfortunately it would be 1.21MWh lol"
They intend to put the charging infrastructure near customer locations. You don't want to spread out your products all over the world and having to place mega chargers somewhere for 1 truck.
"I guess those are Tesla's best markets, they'll add more countries when they're able."
"The back of the cab is probably an aerodynamic shroud, it is hollow."
Those are aerodynamic flaps that move when it turns.
I want to see it turn with a refrigeration unit on the trailer - even less space.
"It turns just fine, even though it looks like it wouldn't. 

It just *barely* clears. I wouldn't have my hand in that gap."
"I think it was ""bamf"" before."
The industrial rate of power is ridiculous compared to what home users pay. In my state; expect to pay \~13 cents per kWh at home. The rate for businesses is 6 cents per kWh.
Regen maybe?
no point. they can just plug in.
Why would it not be able to brake?
"Same or better than other semis. Regen on all power wheels ( same or stronger than Jake brake) then airbrakes on all wheels like other semi's.
0-60 matters when you want to pass another semi up a hill but both of you are floored already and you're only going 1mph faster than the other guy. It just shows you have the power to get going, make passes, etc."
"If the regenerative braking on the semi is anything like that on the Model X, there’s absolutely nothing to worry about. When I test drove a model X, it was stronger than my motorbike’s engine braking in 1st gear. Actually, thinking about it, it’ll be better than a jake brake for noise pollution too."
"Why are we all assuming that the 500 mile range number and the 2kwh/mile number are based on the same towed weight?


500 mile range is probably without a load. That’s why they worded the efficiency number so vaguely, because what you’re towing can vary so widely. “Less than 2kwh/mile”. The heavier the load, the lower the range, the closer you get to 2kwh/mile."
It's always been <2kWh a mile.
Low bar :-)
"Highway speeds, fully loaded."
"iirc they plan to increase the energy business this year, so maybe it will be easier to install, I don't think they're gonna take the battery swap path for now as they figured out how to charge them pretty fast and that reduce the issue to one : putting more super/mega charger stations"
"500 miles is what is stated.

They are saying it will use less then 2kwh per mile and it has a 1000 kwh pack.

This is the only thing I am worried about with the semi and Tesla's future in that space. My (like many other owners) m3 awd is stated at 322 miles but will almost never do more then 240 miles. If a long haul truck only does 350-400 miles no one will buy it. It adds time and logistics complexity plus the efficiency hit in my Tesla means I barely save anything over a gas car."
"Pretty sure it's 80,000 lbs."
k just means 1000. It's somewhat hilarious they are using pounds to describe the weight but that's just because the US don't use a civilized system and won't know what a kilogram is.
"If only they apply the convoy system using the FSD software to follow the leading truck, that's a huge saving."
Are you talking about the cybertruck?
There has been rampant speculation about the weight of the battery pack and authoritative proclamations that there is no way it can be the same weight as a diesel semi. The fact is that we don’t know. Tesla has a way of surprising us. Let’s wait and see before making statements like this.
[deleted]
ELI5 please...
"I am completely making this up 100%, but I think I heard the weight is comparable."
0-60 at full capacity would be somewhere in the ball park of 2 minutes+ for ICE Semi's
"With an 80,000lb load? Thats fast as hell."
"80,000 lbs moving stop to 60 mph in 20 secs is amazing,  haven't you every following a loaded trailer pulling out or accelerating on the on ramp? That's about as fast as a Fiat 850 Spider"
That's completely full too though
The Rockies.   It sucks following a semi in Colorado.
"They’re just Model 3 motors, they’re not powerful enough to perform on their own, plus for redundancy."
You're likely looking at 4 seperate modules for battery and motor. That way its easy to replace in failure and there is redundancy.
"Regen, baby, regen... Think of your gas tank filling back up as you head back down the hill... Also, the 4 independent motors give them active torque vectoring without using brakes...  It can actively damp trailer sway or prevent the vehicle from jackknifing by playing with drive/regent on a per wheel basis..."
"Why not? You don't lose anything by adding them.

Also adds independent AWD/traction control, torque vectoring.. each motor experiences less total peak heating.. Better regen.. the list may go on from there"
How important is acceleration in this application?

"It took me a while to figure out where the 5 minutes came from. I've seen a lot of trucks pull out of truck stops on to the freeway. They're not exactly quick, but I've never seen one take 5 minutes to get to highway speed. It's over in 2 minutes tops."
How would the charging stops affect your scheduling? Do you typically drive more than 500 miles a day? What if you had to stop for 1-2 hours at a supercharger?
"The way my friend described it was that he got to know his transmission really well, and could do clutchless shifts by timing them *just* right. He said there was a risk of fucking up your transmission if you do it his way, but he managed to never do so."
"All clutchless shifts and you skip some of the lower gears. Works best with 13, 15, and 18 gear transmissions, if you’ve got a 10 speed it’s possible, if it’s an 8 or lower then you’re stuck rowing through every gear except usually you can skip first..."
"Yep, they are designed for it and it pops right in if you have the reves right. 

Clutch when downshifting mostly but you can pop that also. 

Thing is if you force it into gear a lot the syncros will go and it will grind a lot. Old trucks tend to be grindy in particular gears as the rebuild is really expensive and other than noise it does not hurt anything."
"Uhhh...you always float the gears on older semi trucks. That's not some high level, elite-truckers-only technique lol."
Automatic truck transmissions are more common than you might think. My last moving truck semi driver laughed when I asked if changing gears all the time was tough on his knees.
"> only burn 200 gallons of fuel in a day

You know that electric will be less than half the cost per day, right? 200 gallons a day, at avg American fuel prices, is still $440/day. Saving $200+ *per day* on fuel is not nothing."
"> Battery investor day

Any word on when that will be?"
More packs the better to take all of the regeneration happening from the massive amount of momentum in a 100kLB machine moving 60mph downhill.    This thing should be fairly efficient outside of acceleration if it can recapture enough energy to the batteries.
"Honest question, if additional energy is spent because truck is a lot heavier than a car, wouldn't it mean it would recover way more energy also when braking?"
I think he said it'll be closer to 600
Then can call it the Megatruck if they hit one megawatt•h of juice.
Reminder that this is at 65mph at max GVW. I calcuated that at 30mph with an empty trailer it will be more like 2500 miles and many plausible low load scenarios can break 1000 miles.
"Elon is also full of hot air. 

Edit: I forgot, Reddit thinks the guy is Jesus. I guess I just blasphemed."
"Unless Tesla is already under $100/kWh at the pack level, which seems crazy, but they've been really guarded about their battery costs.

Even still, the founder's series is likely the only one available to start and it's $200k, so they have $100k to play with for the rest of the truck.  And given low initial volume, I'm sure they're happy with no margin to start with."
"Probably, though in fairness, this thing is pretty much a parts bin special.

The packs are likely just stacked 3 Packs, the Motors are just four Model 3 Rear Motors, even the screens inside are just twin Model 3 Screens and a Model 3 wheel. Then pretty much zero other safety features, no crash testing really needed, probably some off the shelf Hitch equipment and boom. Semi."
"I wonder if they're selling at lower profit margins to get their foot in the door, so to speak"
"$100k is nothing for a new modern semi. And considering that is about how much a diesel semi uses in fuel each year, and that a cc self driving semi would allow you to hire much less experienced drivers (e.g. students that want to study while sitting behind the wheel), this thing will sell like hot cakes. 
Or more likely lease. If they lease it with supercharging included per mile at what you save in Diesel and with a down payment of $100K, is an absolute no brainstorm for any trucker that works along well energized routes (you pay less for a significantly Superior truck that needs no maintenance and that allows you to do extended hours or hire minimally trained drivers) and Tesla could end up making a million dollars per truck during is lifetime.

I've been forecasting for a year that TSLA will hit 500 after the Semi pricing model is announced, boy with the current price where it is I think I need to revise my estimate to 700."
they would have a lot of room for profit margin on the mega charging. I’m skeptical this is the main plan but it is a possibility. Lowering upfront and charging more on refueling makes the cost comparison more similar to diesel.
"No, Tesla has secrets.  All will be revealed at Battery Investor Day."
UPS systems are *far* cheaper than buying a Tesla Semi.
"No that is with the full load. It was so outrageous that an executive at Daimler said it breaks the laws of physics and if true, they are being passed up. So ~~if~~ when Tesla delivers, he will have dug his own grave.

Why do so many cars on eBay not have reverse?
"I was so confused! I thought maybe these were bad specs and you were encouraging people to avoid the tesla semi, lol."
The unveil quoted 400 miles in 30 minutes. That's 2 kWh/mile * 400 miles * 1/2 hours or a 1.6 MW average charge rate; peak will need to be much higher.
"Solar is interesting, to get 1MW of solar you need about a 1/2 acre of solar panels."
"Putting solar panels on the roof of a Tesla semi seems appealing idea to me too, because you can expect about 6000W of power in full sunlight, while that's not that much charge under full load, that could really help when the trailer is empty or under a light load."
It’s like the end goal of Tesla’s business model is to get the world saturated with so many batteries that  energy storage becomes a non-issue.
"Yes, that's what was mentioned at the unveiling two years ago. Do we have any indications that megacharger construction has begun?"
"I think this is how it will start. I unload trucks at my job and they spend no less than 30 minutes backed into the dock. Even if the stop is at the end of a 500 mile range truck, the truck will still be standing at its destination to unload. Park the truck in dock, plug in the charger, unload. Unplug and leave. They'll add them at the first customers locations first before highway aligned Megacharger stations."
"That's the ideal situation for commercial EVs right now, until mega-chargers become as common as truck stops (or at truck stops)."
They can also install smaller chargers at the individual stores if they wanted.  The truck is going to be sitting there for 15-20 minutes anyway while it gets unloaded and the driver goes to the toilet.  Might as well get a bit back in the battery while it's there.
4 might make more sense as the V3 cabinets are 4x250kW. That could be 1 hour to charge from empty which is not bad at all. But maybe they've already designed an 800V version of the V3 to be able to speed that up more over the same plugs and cables.
"Please learn the difference.  Net margin is only applicable to the company as a whole, not to any individual products.  As the user, you erroneously attempted to correct, was referring to Model 3, the correct number to reference is gross margin (which is 20% and rapidly increasing).

Do you understand now the difference between gross and net, or do you need more explanation?"
Think he’s talking gross not net.
"There must be some battery breakthrough in order to sell these semis at a profit, because even at 5k margin (for the standard range) they could make 100k selling 20 model 3's, while the margin on the semi would have to be 50% to make 100k."
Cyber Semi?
"Yup this is the appeal of the 3 and the y as well and really the new cabin style as a whole etc. We own a 3 and an X right now, we bough the 3 first and loved it so we though the X would be perfect to have an SUV size car but I honestly love my model 3 way better and can’t wait for the Y to arrive so we can get rid of the X."
"Exactly, the Semi just needs to work, work well, and work safely. Nothing more. The X has to be all the previous, plus a comfortable family car with premium features, high acceleration and range, and seating for 5-7."
The X only costs $5000 more than the S.
">The X is complicated. 

Remember that Musk called the Model X ""Faberge egg of cars."""
Elon: hold my joint
"rumors say <100$/kwh full stack by 2019. If they can hit nearly 80$/kwh in 2020 then they have 80k$ for battery and 100k$ for the truck. Not implausible imho.

That makes sense: 300 miles range (perhaps 600kwh) for 150k$ and 500 miles range (perhaps 1000kwh) for 180k$. A plus of 200 miles of range for 30k$ for 400kwh. So 75$/kwh. And still dropping."
Can’t upvote this enough.
"Give it 3-5 years. Tesla just delivered 300k Model 3's last year, on top of 150k or so in 2018. This year they're launching Model Y on the same platform. It'll probably sell more.

In a half decade, there's going to probably be millions of these packs and motors out there. My guess is Tesla's modular style 4x20kwh pack setup for 3/Y will end up being super useful for retrofitting into other builds. Especially ones like campers, where you're much less space constrained."
"there are companies out there that make RV semi trailers that you could just tow with the semi and add some solar panels to. not sure exactly how it would work hooking solar panels up to the semi. since solar panels don't output a steady fixed output the onboard charger would need some mode where it just accepts whatever power the panels are currently making, rather than a specific amp setting, i think."
"My friends retired in a https://www.newmarcorp.com/.  Cost them 400K.  Gets shit mileage.

They drive 300 miles at most a day.  Typically stay in a place a week at a time.  

If Tesla used the Semi as a base and could get a real 300 mile range, it would be perfect for this type of thing.  

They typically use RV parks that have a 240V 50 amp plug.  While it isn't going to charge it super fast, but if you can charge for a week, it is going to be more than enough.  

I think there is a significant market for it.  Newmar sells every single RV they can currently make."
"That seems like an overestimate. If you are talking about the max size class A RV I think that would be about 360sqft of roof space, if you had 20% efficient solar panels and cover the whole thing I think that would make a max system of like 7.2kw (which is pretty good, honestly). This would produce a peak of around 45kwh a day (using Arizona and 0 degree tilt on [this calculator](https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php). To get 100 miles/day from that you are talking about roughly 500w/mi, which I don't think is feasible right now. I suppose if you have a bigger array that folds out then that changes a bit, but you have really have to start taking into account all the extra weight here and that you'd probably be hitting 1-2kw/mile potentially."
"I did the math the first time this question was asked. Under perfect conditions, you’re looking at a week to charge the battery. If you have hotel loads on it (e.g. heating and cooling, A/V etc.), it likely wouldn’t ever charge enough."

"I doubt it at the start. I could see a large company getting a handful (5-10, maybe 20) to test them out and train drivers, then if they work well they'll swap their old trucks for Teslas as the diesel ones grow older, or quickly replace their fleet if the Tesla exceeds expectations."
Was it Pepsi light?
Absolutely do not want semi trucks to have anything to do with quick acceleration or fast speed. That's literally the least important variable in trucking.
Yeah that 5 minutes number is stupid.  Just using a little critical thinking and you can realize that it makes no sense.  Trucks basically wouldn’t be able to get on freeways without causing major slowdowns and accidents.

"Battery swap allows you to charge at a lower speed, allowing grids to cope without this huge spikes in load.

"Yes, but wouldn't the range vary greatly depending on how much weight is being moved?  They don't specify the range with the load.  How many miles does the truck get with no trailer vs a full load?

I think these will be limited to city runs and not long hauls for now.  Long hauls are not economical at this point, and would require Tesla to invest in a separate supercharger network that would be considerably more expensive than the current one."
"Yes, but they list it as ""80k pounds"". This means ""80 kilo pounds"". It's not incorrect it's just hilarious."
It was a joke
"Depends on the segment of the industry. Hauling mail or Amazon packages? Yeah weight isn't that big a deal as those are lighter loads. Bulk carriers (like me)? Payload (net weight) is what matters. 

One truck, and certainly not one spec, does not meet all."
"Sure, but sometimes you cube out, sometimes you weigh out. I’m not going to buy two different trucks depending on the load of the day."
"The maximum weight of a semi in the US is 80k, *including the weight of the cab*. A heavy cab means your maximum load is smaller, meaning you earn less money per job.

We don't actually know how much the Tesla semi's cab weighs, though, so this guy's comment is pure speculation."
"The total weight of the truck plus trailer is limited to 80,000lbs at the very high end, usually less based on the roads being used.

The Tesla truck is HEAVY compared to diesel trucks limiting the total payload weight and payload weight limits are generally what limits payload capacity vs space/volume in the trailer.

"This [article](https://bgr.com/2017/11/20/tesla-semi-acceleration-sound-video-0-60/) thinks  it’ll take about a minute, but still, damn."
"Yeah at 80,000 lbs the trailer itself has about 20 times more kinetic energy than a model 3 at the same speed. Put another way too it means it could haul nearly 20 model 3s and get them all to 60mph in 20 seconds"

"You can consider it a safety improvement, allowing for much safer merging and passing on the highway. Especially uphill."
Honestly I expect Tesla to let fleet owners limit torque and acceleration in software. Commercial tunes already exist for normal fleet vehicles.
"When you're paid per mile, the faster you can get to where your going means earning more for less time working.

But I imagine it's more of a happy byproduct of electric motors than a central design choice. Plus, you know, bragging rights."
"It's a game changer for this application.  Both for other drivers on the road and the operator of the semi tractor.

Have you ever watched a semi driver try to keep his momentum as terrain and the flow of traffic change?  It's the reason you will often see a semi-truck tailgating another vehicle(even though the consequences are severe for a commercial drivers license holder).  They badly want to avoid slowing down, because they waste so much fuel returning to cruising speed.  They also want to keep their average speed up for an an efficient overall trip time.

You can easily see this on a downhill section that is followed by an uphill section.  The tractor operator will speed up on the downhill, often higher then the speed limit so that they can maintain momentum on the uphill.  It's quite tedious for the driver and dangerous for the cars on the road.

The biggest game changer is traffic.  A lot of the major traffic congested areas are triggered by a road feature that slows trucks.  The scenario that illustrates this best is also a downhill section followed by an uphill section.  Heavily loaded trucks will often slow to 45 mph on a 65 mph highway on the uphill section, even if it's a short or mild uphill.  You're always going to have semi trucks in the two right lanes, and as you near peak traffic times, the elimination of those two lanes (they're occupied by slowing trucks) will trigger traffic congestion for the rest of the freeway.

If you live in a flat area of the country, a busy onramp can cause the same scenario.  Just two or three trucks being slowed by a large volume of traffic merging onto the freeway will cause a chain reaction as those trucks attempt to regain their speed.  Again, you're going to significantly slow the right two lanes.

&#x200B;

The Tesla semi will probably be the biggest game-changer Tesla produces with the biggest impact on road travel."
Probably meant 1.5 minutes
"It would change the workday and possibly cause a lot of frustration. If the figures are correct and 350 miles is the range in 8 hours, then you spend 2 hours charging, you have 8+2=10. So you have 3 hours left to drive, and 1 extra hour to do other work stuff, and you would like to end up somewhere you can charge overnight. There would be adjustments to make. Fueling takes between 5 and 30 minutes, depending on conditions. A lot of things take time out of the day, but mostly it would be annoying to stop for two hours. Drivers just want to keep moving. 
Typically in 11 hours of driving you can cover 600 to 700 in a day. The difference might be made up some by the faster acceleration.  Also, if someday auto pilot is allowed on the highway, that would change how a driver behaves or rests while the truck is moving. 

A lot of things go into play here."
"Yeah, sounds like clutchless shifting.  And yess you definitely have to do it right or you risk breaking it.  But if you do it right it slips right in"
I used to do that on my old beat up Fiat Punto lol. Don‘t semis have automatic transmissions though?
I understand that (from spending summers driving old trucks when helping my uncles with harvest).  But I wanted clarification about the use of the term “speed-shifting”
"Thanks for the info, I am not up-to-date with trucking trends at all.

"The battery would have to be about an 8 MW. So yeah, its going to be a long while.

Also we have 50 of those trucks, so we would need the local power plant at full tilt each night. 400MW is half of the local coal plant for an hour. lol Honestly thou, that would be a huge grid drain at about 4-6PM when we return and the charge starts."
we only know it's somewhere in Q1/Q2
Don’t trailers usually have brakes in them? You can’t regen from those.
More packs = more weight = less load the truck owner can take.
that's the business case for adding a few maxwell supercapacitors. better regen.
Yup. The Semi would carry a great deal more kinetic energy to recapture.
Closer to 600 than...?
But Its not a real truck though. Only semi

"Even then, the engineering effort required to put everything together and make sure it all works is not a trivial matter at all"
"Most vehicles are parts bin specials honestly.  

In the world of ICE, semis are some of the rare exceptions that aren't. As EVs they can be too!"
"That's kind of the great thing about EVs, though: they can be modular, and they are extremely easy to engineer in that sense (compared to ICE)."
"I'm fairly certain it'll be a completely new battery pack architecture given that the model S/3/X/Y packs are all designed to be structural elements of the chassis and would therefore have a tonne of additional, unnecessary structural material that would add weight to the packs, not to mention packaging a system like that would not be trivial since those packs are designed to be used independently with a motor drive directly connected to the back end. 

I'm also fairly certain they mentioned at some point that the screens would be bigger than the model 3 screens though that might be incorrect recollection. 

Not to mention, given all the changes that they would have to implement with battery management, wiring, vehicle dynamics, and maybe autopilot if they intend to have that on there too, I wouldn't write this off as any form of redesign, there definitely will be mostly new things everywhere, with the exception perhaps being the motors and drive inverter.

EDIT: Given that they claim it's the safest truck ever or something I wouldn't say that there would be no safety testing of any sort, I'm fairly sure there's regulations to be met through crash testing etc"
Do trucks not undergo crash testing?
"Adding to your point, I believe other truck manufacturers use ""off-the-""shelf"" equipment just the same, so it would be totally believable if they go down this route. Meritor is one brand that makes axles, air brakes, suspensions etc."
The packs have to be a higher voltage and than it wouldn't work with the Model 3 Motors.
"there is no way they gonna use model 3 motors, at least not without also gearing them down a ton to get more sustained torque out of them."
Certainly not their plan since many will charge at their own property/charging station.
Havent seen prices on a 1000 kwh ups but quite sure a semi would be close
"If true, it’s surprising they wouldn’t advertise what I assume would be incredible range without a load as well.  As it stands, the page is kind of confusing. They should say what the range is like fully loaded, and without a load."
"I'm assuming that exec was not figuring in some tremendous gains from regenerative breaking & downhill regen? 80k pounds going downhill is a ridiculous amount of energy, even a small percentage of that being put through the four motors back into the batteries would increase range significantly."
Cooling maybe?

"In extreme cases, I have seen mods on /r/SpaceX use CSS tricks to change the title of posts."
Savage.
No synchros so it gets thrashed Maybe? Or is it that it’s like a separate shaft or something that’s more easily damaged? Mechanics of Reddit??
"This is the first prototype of the tesla semi that can reverse! Finally worth buying!

/s"
"Each Ionity station has a theoretical 1.4MW capacity. So this isn't impossible.

But still, you won't have just one truck charging. I really want to know how the grid will handle this.

I'm still not sure about BEV trucks. This is favorable for hydrogen imo.

BEV trucks are great for regional though: MAN has the eTruck, 200km of range with 140kWh apparently. So half the consumption of Semi, although much much smaller."
"My guess?  Elon LOVES commonality, so they’ll use components of 8 V3 Superchargers for 2MW.  Roadster2, SX and Cybertruck Plaid will use 2x250 kW V3 components for 500 kW charging."
"I mean maybe it doesn't need to be that high. Also considering that the truckers can just sleep while they charge, wake up for a bit when fully charged and then go to a parking spot and continue sleep. Although doesn't sound too efficient (especially if you don't wake up at all and then have to pay for idling), so you might just need to keep it at a nap."
"But you don't need that much because the chargers won't be running all the time, at least at first."
Would be very cool to see a Megacharger with Solar network all the way down the I-10 sunbelt.
"Just curious, how much could you get with panels in top of the trailer? Could it add enough range to be worth it?"
Return journey of an empty truck doesn’t require the same energy as outgoing. Don’t even need a full charge.
Park the trailer at dock. Move cab to charger.
"they will have to be dedicated mega charger stops as nobody is going to retrofit an existing truck stop with the transformer infrastructure required to provide multiple megawatts of power on the fly.

we are talking about millions of dollars just for a single transformer to step down the high voltage network to something you can use to step down with another transformer for each mega charger.

its gonna be a ton of equipment needed to supply these chargers unless you already have massively over sized transformers on site."
"Keep in mind truckers need rest, doing 500miles per charge will take 6-10 hours, so an hour to charge is more than enough for long haul."
I think they won't make a cybersemi right away just because it would be too badass. It would make cybertruck look wimpy
I just realized with the pickup the lineup is Cyber S3XY.
Why’s that exactly? Very curious
That's why we need a Cyber SUV!
"Not exactly. Driver retention is one of the biggest issues in trucking. If this truck doesn’t have all the bells and whistles, creature comfort features, etc. like the competition has, it’s a non-starter."
"I'm curious, what are the main points that the 3 does better than the X?

Edit: wrong comment"
Only
"I was thinking of doubling that with panels that rolled out, but I still don't think you would be hitting that much and I figure it would use less than 1k.  Even with that I might have over estimated it and it's hard to calculate what they could come up with especially when figuring in weight and drag."
My line of thinking was that newer subscribers might upvote this because they never would’ve known the specs to begin with.
"Fleet conversions would take place at a slow pace.  So if you ordered 100 you wouldn’t get 100 at a time. More like spaced out based on need and capacity and driver training. 

The box is more of and interest and seriousness  question to place them in order."
big brain time
Being able to merge onto a freeway safer without holding up traffic is the least important?
"Several, dozens, hundreds? of towns across the country have truck bans. The drivers can drive in, make the delivery and get out. 
They can't stay overnight to rest. 
And many have inconvenient routes to keep trucks out of their quiet pretty little streets. 
I mean some of it makes sense, but it's crappy to dismiss the human element and think only of the giant truck as a blotch in the town. 
Because, yes, trucks deliver EVERYTHING."
"You would think, but truckers are not united enough to make real pushback. We all complain but there's no central organization."
"Almost an almost 500,000 mile buffer hahaha. I would get one if that was the case"
"I don't think they'll have any problem getting orders. I'm not in logistics, but if it turns out they are available really quick I might just get into it just to make a quick killing as long as competitors are still driving ICE."
"The motors are obviously very powerful, so the same would be true in reverse. The regen would be crazy"
And it has 4 electric motors that can do that. It won't have any trouble stopping
"If this thing could go 600+ miles without a load, don’t you think they’d advertise that?

(I’m prepared to be wrong on this, I’ll just be really surprised)"
"They have stated that they are designing these for long and short hauls. Typically a full trailer avoids cities as much as possible.

500 miles is the minimum the way they have stated it. With no load, it should get significantly more, but I doubt it will be more then 20%."
"It's super common here in the US to literally substitute ""k"" for the word ""thousand"".  It's usually done with money....  $50k, $100k, ($50,000; $100,000)etc...

You'll usually see it as a type of written shorthand but it's often spoken that way as well.  If someone says simply ""50 KAY"", they typically mean ""50 thousand dollars"".

When written, it's often used for things other than money (80k lbs)...It's less common when spoken to refer to anything other than money, but it's still done occasionally."
"Yeah, normal semis have two seats, are.boxier, some have sleeper space in the back with a fridge etc. Tesla is one seat, a wheel and a couple screens. Until we know more, it's impossible to speculate where the weight will be."
"Just to put it out there, most individual loads don't pay more due to weight its more of a supply vs demand thing"
How heavy though?
it'll take about a minute with a big 15L or 16L engine with a manual and perfect shifting. AMTs take longer and most trucks have smaller engines 11L or 13L so will generally be slower than this.
Hope they have some serious brakes on these things!
They’re going to have to retrain warehouse workers on how trucks should be loaded. Can’t imagine how much the cargo will shift under that acceleration... it’s a huge change to the entire logistics process.
"Regen in regards to in city delivery trucks, city cabs, Mail delivery, and public bussing has to make a whole lot of sense to adopt sooner than later in our current infrastructure."
"it would be like ~~following~~ getting passed by a regular vehicle.

FTFY"
"Similar power level across all speeds, I guess."
"Sure, more acceleration is nice to have, but I'm wondering about willingness to pay for acceleration in a semi truck.  Consumers are willing to pay $1-2k for each 1s reduction in 0-60, but that's because consumers are irrational and are paying for fun, not usefulness.  I'd imagine carriers are more rational and arent going to shell out big dollars for something that doesnt improve either cost or safety."
The other commenter said it takes 5 minutes for a fully loaded truck to reach 60mph. This number is way wrong in a practical sense.
"Thanks.

I guess 600-700 miles would still be possible in a day with just a modest 30min stop, assuming that there was overnight charging that could take it to full. That might be a stretch to assume overnight charging, though.  No idea how that’d work."
I've heard veteran truckers get to the point they only need a clutch for shifting the lowest gears.
How does it work? Can you do the same thing in a manual transmission car?
"Fiat, no kidding... Step dad used to be a trucker, when he told me about shifting without the clutch i tried it on my '77 Fiat spider and it worked great. Drove that way until the car fell apart."
Maybe the new ones but forever they used big massive manuals.
Automatic transmissions are a lot heavier. Heavier cab = smaller load = less money per run. That's how my friend explained it. Though he hasn't driven semis since the mid 2000s. Things may have changed since then with regards to automatic transmission weight.
"You likely won't have to all draw max charging power simultaneously. The system could be programmed to provide max power to only a portion of the fleet, until they are charged, then shift the power to another portion of the fleet.

This is how the charging network at my work functions. They offer only 8amps unless you specify when you're going to leave and how much charge you need that day, using their app. Then they intelligently split the available max power between all the connected cars, since they know how much average power is necessary per car over ~8 hours.

Not sure where you're getting that 8MWh number from. It's looking like Tesla Semi batteries are going to be around 1MWh, based on the power consumption and range numbers they give."
I find it a bit curious/strange that it is not more pinned down than that. How am I supposed to mark it on my calendar then?
Not with that attitude
"They do but you can adjust them to get some more out of the truck, and it will likely be possible to regen off them in the long future when electric adoption is nearer to saturation..."
Some refrigerated trailers do use trailer axle generation to put power in the battery for a hydraulic lift on the tailgate.  It's not widespread.
"Absolutely, they use air brakes, they are normally closed calipers that open with air, so that if the trailer detaches, it locks up brakes for safety.

The thing is there is a brake controller and that controller fine tunes the braking force on the trailer axles as appropriate for the load. On an emergency braking activation, those brakes will work, and not generate power for the tractor, in mild braking it's usually safe to exclude trailer axle brakes. Less so when turning or on low traction surfaces or heavy loads. 

Safe to assume Tesla will fine tune the controller to get the most braking force generating power in various scenarios."
"Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't trailer brakes activated when the truck's brakes are activated? If so, it would act just like any other Tesla; max regen occurs when your foot is off both pedals, and the brake pedal only activates mechanical brakes."
"Yep, and trailer brakes are connected to the semi tractor.  I see Tesla building a trailer with a generator / battery combo.

For short haul loads it could just be a generator that feeds the tractor battery.  For long haul loads the trailer generator could feed an auxiliary battery on the trailer."
"Yeah, the max weight is fixed. So you don't want to go crazy and pack as much as you can possibly fit. But the more you get the less frequently you'll have to stop and you can deliver the load faster."
500
"Oh no, not at all. Spot on, but I imagine that they are still assuming massive battery cost improvements, maybe those improvements are there already. Not sure."
There's still a ton of savings to be had over legacy truck manufacturers who have parts made only for their medium volume truck lines.
"It's not trivial, sure, but making a modular combustion engine design is probably a magnitude more difficult than getting what is essentially just stacked components to work together."
"True, but that is a fixed one time cost.  And it has already been mostly paid."
Not to the extent of Tesla.  A Porsche does not use the same engine and transmission as a Golf.
"Good efficient motors and good Li batteries are hard to make. No one has managed to make them as good as Tesla. I would argue a good electric car is much harder to make than an ICE car. There is a reason it has taken 150 years to make a good EV and only 25 years to make a good ICE car. EV is much much more advanced, event though mechanically more simple."
[deleted]
Screens might be 17’s like Cybertruck and future SX.
They do but the requirements are much more lax than that of cars.
"Very different standards. If truck hits not truck, truck driver is fine. If truck hits truck, both trucks fucked. You can't make something that big that holds up the same way a model 3 does. You have square function scaling strength of materials and cube scaling mass, generally.

To keep the truck functional you basically give up dedicated crumples, and then if the truck head on crashes into another truck or a solid boulder, the whole truck crumples."
"""What about 'crumple zones'????!""  </cybertruck\_trolls>"
Is Tesla the kind of company that's ever done anything off-the-shelf or remotely similar to the rest of the industry though?
"No, they don't. Packs could be linked in parallel or in seriea."
"Of course. Same motor, shorter gearing. It’s mounted to a different gear reduction unit."
I am sure Tesla can put together a turnkey mega-charging station for all Fleet buyers...  Who else could do it economically and consistently?
No. The UPS would be half that price.
"To get it up to that uphill position would take more energy than you could ever recapture. Even if your goal was to capture as much regen as possible going downhill and cared nothing of other factors such as safety, load capacity, durability, etc. 

Thermodynamics dictates some energy will be lost as entropy during any energy conversion. So assuming you don't start every trip at the top of a hill and all loads are not downhill, regen will still mean less range than if you carried the load on a flat road with all other things being equal.

Incidentally there is a mining EV that does use physics so it never needs to be charged. It does this by starting its day empty and travels uphill. Then when the load is added to the vehicle, it regens on the way down. That additional weight allows it to regen more than the energy it needs to get uphill. It is using potential energy of the material being transported as its fuel. This however is a very specific scenario and not applicable to most Semi routes."
I wish you Tesla Roadster 2020
[deleted]
Did we? Maybe once. Typically we just flair it with a correction
"It's a reference to a question someone asked because they were misreading ""No Reserve"" on ebay as ""No Reverse""."
"> Each Ionity station has a theoretical 1.4MW capacity. So this isn't impossible.

I don't know why you are suggesting something like. How big were the largest electric car charging stations two decades ago compared to a modern 350kW individual stall?

>I really want to know how the grid will handle this.

They will absolutely have to have batteries on location to handle that sort of charging rate. Probably DC/DC direct from battery to battery. The station only needs to pull a fraction of the required peak power when the grid is at peak usage. And charging up onsite batteries during the night will save Tesla some money as power is always cheaper at night.

>This is favorable for hydrogen imo.

Hydrogen is basically impossible to store or transport as we don't have any way to store it well. It's great on paper but the engineering might make it too costly to ever reach the market in any substantial way. Economies of scale don't help when leakage is the problem."
"Hydrogen in is terrible unless it's for highly regulated aerospace /energy/research applications.

I don't want trucker Joe filling up the tank with hydrogen while eating a tuna sandwich. Methane is much better in that regard"
400 miles is just over 5 hours at 75 Mph. Truckers don't need to sleep every 5 hours.
I don’t know about super chargers around you but in LA there is always a wait.   I heard the ones between major cities can get up to a 50 car lines for the chargers.
Let say if you could fit 60 solar panels on the the top of a trailer.  I maybe way off since i don't really know the actual size of a trailer. That would produce 18KWH of power.   If the truck consumes 1.5KW per mile that would get you 12 miles extra per hour.
"Trailer: 102"" x 52' ≈ 63,650"" sq

Tesla solar panel: 66"" x 39"" ≈ 2,575"" sq

Max coverage ≈ 25 panels @ 3.8 kW or approx. 16 kWh/day ea. according to Tesla

Gives you approx. 400 kWh/day total. Not too shabby. Someone check my math though."
I dont think trucks go anywhere empty.
What are the laws like in the States on fatigue management. Not sure exactly what it is here in the UK but I know they need to have a break after x hours and all trucks are gps logged with massive fines for not having breaks.
"Truckers need to rest but the truck doesn't. There is long hauling that uses two or three drivers to not need to stop. If you are doing distribution from a warehouse you can also change drivers between deliveries, but then loading/unloading times may be long enough that you can charge during those if the infrastructure is prepared for it."

"A few reasons really. It is larger than we actually need which isn’t a really huge deal but does make some parking kind of a pain. The wing doors are cool when you park outside, pretty much every indoor parking garage around Seattle though doesn’t jive well with them. Including our own garage in our townhouse. The inside too is just way too cluttered in the X and S format. I find myself searching for things a lot more often than I do in my 3. Granted I got the 3 first and got really comfortable worth the way it is set up before we got the x, and I know they are basically the same but something about it all just confuses me sometimes. It’s about the simplicity and the technology for me. Though since we are downsizing our price tag I am going for the y in performance at least lol and I am going to get a cool wrap."
I'd be interested too. Perhaps too big for parking? Something else uncomfortable? Or...
Ordered a cyber truck too for our third vehicle lol. The plan is to have the model 3 and model y we out daily drivers and cyber truck as a weekender.
"It's a day truck, so it doesn't need many bells and whistles. A quality seat is probably the biggest requirement. 

There's no shortage of drivers for day truck operators."
"If it's easier to drive and thus easier to learn to drive it could have some specific bell or whistle missing and still increase the number of available drivers for that platform.

Or alternatively if Self Driving becomes a thing less drivers are needed which reduces the issue of driver retention from another angle."
That tells me the fun part of the 0-60 time is relevant as well
"Those features are what?

Automatic A/C, radio, satnav, good seats, hood steering wheel, dampened seats, ability to connect your phone.

Or in other words they are cheap.

But you can save a lot of money by just making the rest of the interior out of injection molded plastic. The seats out of fabrics instead of leather. No gullwing doors."
"Lol. Standard semi has 2 shitty stereo speakers. Tesla semi has the full model 3 stereo (without the subwoofer). 

One takes a minute to get up to speed, the Tesla semi can drive with the flow of traffic

Which one do you want to spend the day in?"
I think you responded to the wrong comment.
A steal considering the complexity of the falcon wing doors.
Basically rounding error
"Nothing wrong with that, I was just trying to figure out what changed in the link according to OP."
Absolutely. Trucking around full containers and pretending quick 0-60 is safe is peak Tesla virtue asshole signaling.
"I can only imagine; with a 80,000lb load the amount of energy recovered from regen braking would be huge.   It's like free energy compared to diesel trucks."
Oh I get why they've done it it's just hilarious
I heard Nikola say battery electric class 8 trucks will be 4-5000 lbs more than diesel in one presentation for what it’s worth.
"I’d assume they have the same amount of brakes as any other semi. They aren’t going faster than other trucks, or carry more than any other semi.."
Just turn on chill acceleration.
I remember reading that garbage trucks are the worst polluters and least efficient vehicles on the road. Would love to see them replaced.
Might actually be cheaper than a transmission yea
The acceleration isn't what sells the semi. It's just a happy side effect of electric motors. Cost efficiency is the main selling point
"It gives the driver options. And it's also safer. 

One instance has been mentioned, which is merging on the highway. Big difference pulling into the right lane going 35mph while everyone else is going 70; or getting up to 60, obviously. 

Another is start/stop situations such as heavy traffic or synchronized stop lights. It's annoying not being able to make the lights due to slow acceleration, then you have to wait for the next cycle and everyone gets pissed. 

Acceleration also gives you the option to get away from or maneuver away from potential danger or a potential collision. You can't juke if you're standing still."
"I don't think anyone is paying specifically for the decrease in 0-60 time. It just happens to be a convenient side effect of a powerful electric drivetrain which needs to be powerful for use on hills, which actually is a useful thing companies would pay for"
"Again, acceleration not because it is cool but because it makes it easier to drive.

Next time you merge onto the highway imagine if your 0-60 took 5 minutes"
"It's also a demonstration of how much excess power is available compared to a normal semi. With that much power available they should be able to keep speed going up inclines much better which could reduce travel time, especially in mountainous areas like I-70 west of Denver."
They'll finally be able to cross those railroad tracks in time.
"You‘re not paying extra for it. The batteries and motors need to withstand a high power draw, or else they cannot move the vehicle at speed against air resistance.

At low speeds, the motors will provide as much torque as the electronics and tires will let them. It’s an inherent feature of EVs that Tesla advertises because they might as well."
The quicker acceleration means shorter transit times which means more profit for the company
You’re not paying for acceleration. That’s just a side effect.   You’re paying for saving money.
"depends on how much of driving is city driving, or driving in heavy traffic, not accelerating in 1.5 minutes can decrease overal travel time significantly, especially if you factor in faster speeds at going uphill. and every minute saved is a lot of $, since they are driving all the time, so it cumulates a lot through the years. I think carriers will be even more eager to pay for more power, especially since it doesn’t consume more gas to achieve that. Sure, no one cares if the empty semi is able to accelerate in 20s or 5s, but 1.5 minutes and 20 seconds (fully loaded) is a heck of a difference"
"I think the acceleration is a side-benefit, it's not something they are charging a premium for."
"Mentioning zero to 60 for a tractor trailer is just marketing. I have no doubt the acceleration will be useful for short haul trucking though- an 8 hour shift might get done in six hours, so you could have one day shipping in a larger area."
"They’re paying for the gas savings buddy, not the acceleration. Acceleration is just the cherry on top"
"For short distances(harbors etc) it's probably very useful, because you'll likely have to stop quite a few times"
"In Software, this question comes up often. 

Should we invest in making the web page load 0.5s faster ? 

Should we invest in the batch program run 5% minutes faster ? 

The answer is ALWAYS yes. It becomes the default expectation and you lose business if you don't."
"The Tesla Semi is priced very appropriately for other Semi Trucks. 

There is not cost increase due to the faster acceleration"
"This isn't the same

For comparison

The SLOWEST car has a zero to 60 time of 30 seconds. That is literally the slowest car, and yet is three times faster then a ""quick"" semi.

A base model dodge caravan does 0-60 in around 12 seconds. One of the slowest minivans on the planet does 0-60 nearly eight times faster then a quick semi.

This is more about the ability to get up to traffic speeds. It is very very difficult (and dangerous) to merge with a 40-50mph speed difference (average driver has a 2-5mph diff),yet that is what a semi usually does."
I think people would definitely pay more for FSD . Speed just happened to be a bonus.
"On an Eaton 18 speed.   You only really use the clutch to the floor for 1st or Reverse.    Only when stopped to engage the gear.  

There's a brake on the release bearing to slow the main shaft down so it can engage 1st. 

These transmissions are NON synchronous.   Except splitting gears and shifting ranges.   There are only these two syncronizers Fancy word for a gear brake for matching speeds between two components 

You have to match each gear and engine RPM. 

Upshifting is pretty easy but downshifting you have to rev match for the gear to engage. 

Eaton does recommend pushing the clutch in half way then selecting neutral release the clutch and clutch half way again and select the next gear.   Aka double clutching. 

This should be done for each gear split and a range shift. 

Disconnecting the power transfer helps reduce wear and tear.

A lot of drivers with experience don't need to do this and if it's done right you dont put any excessive wear on the shift collars.      Each gear split does have a syncronizer and the range shift has one too. 

Done wrong and you end up with a gear that won't hold and pops out under load or you can't split gears.


The better you match the gear change to engine rpm the less wear there is. 

It really is an art when you have 80,000lbs behind you and some dickhead changes lanes and slams his breaks and it's the middle of winter. 


This is to the best of my knowledge as a mechanic who's rebuilt a ton of these."
I’ve heard of many that only need a clutch to get the truck moving...
"The purpose of the clutch is to disconnect the engine from the gearbox so that no power is transferred between them. If you manage the throttle and the timing just right, you can achieve the same effect by matching the engine speed exactly to the gearbox input speed. With no power transferred through the gearbox you can slip it out of gear. Match the engine speed exactly to the gear you're shifting into and you can slip it right into gear as well.

It can be done on manual cars and motorcycles but it's not recommended because if you do it wrong you can damage the gearbox."
"It looks like Volvo trucks ship default with automatics now. Or rather ""automated manuals."""
"Elon will tweet the date for sure a week/two before it, don't worry ^^

Edit: or you can just follow Tesla IR website for any new events"
"You must be new here!  This is Tesla, if it happens in the next 6 months like expected we are happy.  

Realistically they will announce a date a few weeks before it happens and  maybe 50% chance push it back a month after the announcement"
"Maybe not the flat 6 (which often share the same block with different bore and stroke), but plenty of other Porsches share engines with other cars.  The cayenne hybrid uses the same engine as the VW Toureg, the Macan uses a EA888 which is very common.

Let alone all of the other ""parts of the whole"" that get shared.  A good mechanic can save a ton of money by knowing which oem parts are interchangeable (then ordering the part number from a cheaper car).  Aston martin and jaguar are probably the best known examples of this (particularly during the Ford years)."
"It took 150 years to make a good EV because it took until 1990 to invent lithium ion batteries. From there, it has taken about 25 years to make li-ion batteries practical to put in cars for the mass market. 

As far as electric motors, we've had them since the day of Tesla. And I mean *Nikola* Tesla. The 3-phase induction units in the Model S were of a design invented by him. 

There is some complexity there too, in the drive electronics. But there have been competent mechanical computers since world war 2 (the cams in an ICE are a great example), and that problem thus doesn't necessarily require modern technology to solve. 

In other words, the one real thing that prevented us from having electric cars in the 1900s was the battery chemistry. Incidentally, we *did* have electric cars then. But the battery chemistry held us back. 

So it's not really a matter of 25 years versus 150 years. It's a matter of having the right technology unlocked first. Because once we had adequate battery chemistry, the timelines are pretty similar. And that timeline includes improving Li-ion from its initial discovery to now. Tesla does lead the market, but that's a matter of foresight and investment, not because it's something physically only they can do."
"Motors are hard to make? I feel like efficiency in electric motors has been well understood for a pretty long time. Teslas are a tiny bit better, but they are ahead in battery management and other tech much more."
"Also, it's been a long time since the reveal and things are bound to have changed even more. I just read a report about some semi prototypes having 26 cameras, way more than the current autopilot boards were designed to handle (current cars only have 9) which could imply large changes there too."
Imagine being concerned about pedestrian safety.
"Aren't their brakes and (non air) suspension pretty off the shelf?

I believe Elon's even said that if there's a way to solve a problem by buying someone else's tech that they absolutely will."
"For sure:

* original Roadster chassis

* Mercedes switchgear in Model S

* Takata airbags

...aaand I have no idea what else. They really do do a lot of their own stuff."
"I imagine they will use a standard steer axle, at least."
"Lots. Autopilot computer *was* Nvidia. AP1 was mobileye. Airbags, tires, turn signal stalks were Mercedes I think. And the batteries were straight Panasonic before Tesla started with modified chemistry. Infotainment screen was same as iPad. Processor is a Tegra I think."
They need the higher voltage to accommodate charging.
"Yeah roughly calculated that too now, makes sense that the battery and inverter would cost about half the price of the vehicle, its just cool that the truck could potentially double as an industrial scale UPS potentially. Anyone know if the inverters can be used as three phase AC?"
I’ll take it
So it works in the only good version of reddit
"Yeah, it was years ago though, like, EchoLogic-era. Might have event BEEN EchoLogic that did it."
Oh lol that makes more sense
"I don't understand your first argument at all. Are you suggesting that this will get developed? I thought the semi was coming out this year. If you want to sell it, the infrastructure has to be there. They won't be taking other routes just to wait for chargers to be built

Seond one I can understand and agree.

Third, how is hydrogen impossible to store or transport? All HBEV have pressurised tanks which work fine. Sure they might leak a bit over a month, but that's not that important. Siemens also used hydrogen at Goodwood, they had a big trailer which had 6 MWh of hydrogen in it (3 MWh usable after conversion in fuel cell). They are also developing a trailer with more capacity (more efficient transport). 

Green hydrogen is also the best way to store excess energy from renewables when there is not enough demand. For that use case batteries are too expensive and not worth it."
">Hydrogen is basically impossible to store or transport as we don't have any way to store it well. It's great on paper but the engineering might make it too costly to ever reach the market in any substantial way. Economies of scale don't help when leakage is the problem.

   I don't disagree with your conclusion, but feel like that is a very extreme view against hydrogen. We can store it and transport it just fine, but not as easily and petroleum or electricity. Hydrogen cars seem to work well for the few people that have them"
"Oh yeah that's not very much. I was under the impression that you had a much bigger battery, but you obviously need more power so it makes sense to still have that range. But a 30 minute nap every 5 hours or dinner and stuff is something still feasible and does not sound so bad."
How many semis do you think they're going to ship per year?
"On two days a year, perhaps."
"Hub to store deliveries?

Loathe be it to say but... Gas delivery trucks?"
Not sure the exact rules but they do exist here.
"In Sweden and I guess all EU a truckdriver can drive 9-10 hours in 1 day and maximum 56 hours in 1 week. He can maximum drive 4 hours 30 min before resting and he has to get atleast 45 min rest during a workday. This is simplified version. There are alot of other rules but this is the base to go from.

&#x200B;

If your interested a couple of other rules for solo driver. (there are alot more rules if you are 2 or more drivers)

\-you can only drive 10 hours 2 times in 1 week.

\-you can maximum drive 90 hours in 2 weeks

\-you can take 2 breaks instead of 1 45 min break during a day. then the first one have to be 15 min and second 30min.

\-Normaly you have to have 11hours of  continuous  break everyday.

\-You can do 2 breaks in 1 day instead then the first break have to be atleast 3 hours and the last one atleast 9 hours.

There are alot more rules but I do not have them in my head atm. Crazy the amount of rules around trucking in Sweden (EU)."
Mmmm cars
Gotcha! Awesome plan
Lucky!
Daycab only and no sleeper?
"20sec isn’t exactly rocket levels of acceleration lmao.


Edit: not to mention it’s not as if you slam on the pedal every time you accelerate."
Actual truck drivers seem to disagree.
"Would be a surprisingly easy job for an ev, since most of the day they're at a standstill. Would need more battery to run hydraulics and compactor than the actual vehicle motion."
Its because they're always running and half the time they're moving they are accelerating
"Right, which is why I think it's slightly weird that 0-60 is ""above the fold"" on the linked page - it's the first metric stated in each section of the site.  

I wonder if this is marketing's way of saying ""hey truckers, keep reading, this thing is actually pretty cool,"" basically trying to show traditional 3PLs and other fleets that better efficiency doesn't mean lame compromises.  

And actually, for me this has been Tesla's main contribution to cleaner tech.  IMO convincing people to switch to more efficient stuff usually implies heavy compromise or inconvenience, like low flow shower heads or separating your recycling, which is a losing battle.  Tesla is showing that actually you can make high efficiency stuff be pretty cool.

Maybe this marketing for the Semi is tapping into that message?"
"Ok so if you're a 3PL, how much more are you willing to pay for a tractor that does 0-60 in 70 seconds instead of 90 seconds, all else equal?  What's that 20 seconds worth to you?"
[removed]
"It's not excess power it's just a side effect of having to have a lot of low end torque without a gearbox.

So you need a really powerful motor."
"never mind the company. most drivers get paid by the mile, not the hour."
"That's a CI/CD process for deployed applications, though.  This is different -  a design parameter for a new product.  At my software company, we have discussions with the product management guys early on in the product definition process where we are constantly asking them why they've included various features and requirements, and what customers are willing to pay for them and why.  The answer is not always yes in this case.  There are all sorts of cool features you can add that are totally worthless.  ""Every Tesla Semi will come with a loudspeaker that plays only the Nyancat song at 120db.""  Its an absurd example, but clearly you dont add all the features you can think up.  Every feature needs a theory of the case for why customers will pay for it."
"OK, so if acceleration is not valuable (in that customers are not willing to pay more for it), why is 0-60 listed as the first feature in each section of the linked webpage?"
"Ok so you are advancing the theory that the value comes from improved safety by avoiding rear end accidents.  

The question then is, how important is this?  How many accidents involving semi trucks are rear-end accidents, and how many of those could have been avoided with better acceleration?

Are we solving a problem that is large or small?

If we can avoid accidents, what is that worth?  This should have impact on insurance rates, lost time, workers comp, and potentially ability to attract drivers.  How much?

And if the safety impact is significant, why is the marketing all about Badass Performance instead of safety?"
"Very interesting, thanks for taking the time to explain that. One of the best things about Reddit is when a domain expert shares their knowledge."
"> It really is an art when you have 80,000lbs behind you and some dickhead changes lanes and slams his breaks and it's the middle of winter.

That's when you say a quick silent prayer of thanks to the dashcam that you made sure to check out for pre-trip is recording, curse loudly, and you slam directly into that idiot's vehicle.

Apparently some people never learn that loaded semi trucks do not do stop, go, or handle like your average passenger car."
"I’m late to this but laughing because I’ve never heard of anyone using the clutch except for takeoff. It’s relatively simple. You lift your foot off the gas at the right rpm and as they fall you make your shift without clutching. It’s how they’re meant to be driven. 

Speed shifting is shifting without taking your foot off the gas."
"And the consequences of fucking it up on a motorcycle are much more severe, like locking up the rear tire."
"Interesting, cool explanation, thanks 👍"
"I used to speed shift an old Pinto station wagon my girlfriend had LOL It was just as you say, if you had the RPM matched just right, you could just slip it out of gear and into the next gear with no grinding. When downshifting you needed to blip the throttle to get the rpms just right. It's not really anything you can just get in and do the first time, but once you get a ""feel"" for the car and the gearing it's fairly easy to do."
I guess those are some good points.
Maybe we will get news about that in the Q4 conference call
Ha! :)
"Great perspective, thanks for taking the time to write this."
"Generally agree, but you kinda glossed over semi conductor driven variable frequency control of motors, as well as the recent fine tuning of field oriented control that makes Tesla efficiency possible. 

There's also the tid bit about other batteries being shelved to prevent EV competition. Primarily thinking of NiMH and GM here"
That's 3x the input - maybe Semi will require HW4
"There are a million semis already on the road. None of them have ""crumple zones"", autopilot, or automatic emergency braking. But yet let's be hysteric about the one demo CyberTruck that we've seen videos of."
"Air suspension is from Continental originally, and the recent ones look the same, so I'm pretty sure it still is off the shelf too. They just made a more efficient solenoid to preserve battery life."
They definitely do a lot of things themselves to save money but maybe you're right about them not going through the effort with the semi since it's very low volume and there's not much cost savings to achieve there
"I don't know enough about the airbags and turn signals and stuff to say anything, but Panasonic was just the battery provider, the entire battery assembly was always done in-house. Screens are pretty much only built by a few companies and redesigning them makes no real sense, but they definitely didn't just use the exact same screen, iPads aren't that big nor are they rated for the extreme temperatures of a car. 

About the processor, the one in the MCU is an x86 part and the one in the AP board is a custom SoC based on ARM cores, neither is a Tegra. You are right about the AP computer being an Nvidia part, though that was replaced as soon as they had a custom solution ready"
"Not necessarily, they could have onboard hardware to transform a very high input voltage into multiple lower voltage feeds and charge a bunch of packs in parallel."
">I don't understand your first argument at all. Are you suggesting that this will get developed?

Yes, it's already being developed. Years ago elon tweeted about 350 kW charger being ""a child's toy"". So they have it in the works.

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/812708946225963008

> they had a big trailer which had 6 MWh of hydrogen in it (3 MWh usable after conversion in fuel cell)

That's enough to fill like 30 cars. While small gasoline tankers have enough to fill 300 cars with larger ones easily holding enough for ten thousand cars. We are still a long way from a working and usable hydrogen system for vehicles.

>Green hydrogen is also the best way to store excess energy from renewables when there is not enough demand. For that use case batteries are too expensive and not worth it.

I don't think so. I'm 99% sure you are wrong but would you provide a source?"
"If the warehouse is higher elevation than the store it's possible it could regenerate energy while breaking downhill, and that could be enough to drive the empty truck back up.

It would be very situational, but I know someone is already doing this with trucks used in a high altitude mining operation."
Sure. I was actually thinking of senis going city to city.
That will probably be the next version.
"Why do you need a sleeper when RoboSemi drives itself?


^([…waits for the coin to drop])"
Sleeper implies you can charge this at random truck stops on your route. Which isn’t happening now.
"I mean I think faster acceleration is good but I doubt anyone in this comment drive actually drive semi's. If they do they just haven't explained they do? My dad drives tow trucks and semi's for 20+years  and he says the fast acceleration sounds dangerous to him. So idk. I think we have truck drivers that both like, and dislike this"
"Acceleration is also indicative of how quickly a Class 8 truck can cross mountain ranges with a full load.

The GF1 -> Fremont trip, where Tesla transports full loads of Model 3 battery packs, goes via the I-80 through the Donner Pass, **at over 7,000 feet (2,100m) altitude**. This is a dangerous route for trucks."
It’s fun.  Nothing wrong with fun.   Truck drivers don’t like being slow so if they see saving money and more fun then it’s a double bonus.
"Blissfully unaware of actual trucking facts, I imagine some advantage to being able to make use of a smaller opening in traffic to merge onto an interstate. Shaving off a few minutes over a day there (and at traffic lights) might make going electric a more attractive proposition."
Actual semi buyers arent reading that page anyway
They list it first because it's the most improved performance number.
"Remember the semi unveil? Everybody was screaming all over the place, even though probably none of them was a truck driver. I'd guess this is more about Teslas performance image, than appealing to the actual people buying it. And sure the drivers might like it too, and might push a little bit to their employeers. 

&#x200B;

But at the end of the day, cost decides this. If the Semi isn't cheaper, it won't be sucessfull."
Nailed it dude.
"0-60 in 20 instead of 90 seconds. 

That’s a huge difference. 

But the big difference, IMO, is going to be being able to climb hills at 65mph instead of 6mph. Trucks all crawl in the mountains because diesel can’t accelerate uphill, it just keeps getting slower."
"It's not a linear question/answer. 
There are many determining factors which play into it besides just cost and acceleration. 
Overall, I think I would pay for it. 
To answer simply, I believe there would be less wasted energy overall."
Being on time is important. Being in an accident is time consuming.
"""Improving performance"" is not something that you should wait for customers to educate you on OR needs worthless meetings to discuss pros and cons using power points. It is core."
"No, that is one such aspect. In general however it will be far easier to drive when it can more closely match the performance of regular automobiles.

You are conflating the automobile selling argument of fastest. This isn't about drag race performance and who has the smaller, I mean bigger, um, engine. Dodge sells helcats because it is fastest and that appeals to the machoism of many buyers, that is not why the semi performance is a big deal."
"I know many who need a clutch when range shifting, especially on old 2 or 3 stick transmissions..."
Did the same thing on my pre-owned 1961 VW bug.
"For sure. I have Twitter only to follow Elon because I missed Autonomy Day. And only could see it one day after... Tesla IR will help me as well.

Beyond that Twitter sucks imho."
"It's definitely true that our levels of efficiency couldn't be achieved without semiconductors and fairly advanced drive controllers. But honestly that's kind of true of modern ICEs too, with variable spark timing and fuel feeding and knock prevention and a lot of other things. 

What I was trying to say though, is that it's not as impossible as it might seem. We use computers for nearly everything today, and it makes it seem like it's impossible to solve solutions without them. But we've been coming up with clever solutions for basically ever. A few good examples of those in cars are the mechanically-driven commutator in the alternator, and v-tech to create variable valve timing. There are always many solutions to a given problem, and though microcontrollers and silicon transistors may be the best solution today, they're not the only one possible. An industry driven to improve (like the ICE industry for the last 50 years) comes up with many interesting solutions, some of which work so well they become ubiquitous. If we had been using electric cars back then, I definitely believe we would have similarly complex-yet-functional solutions to these problems, just like we have for gas engines."
"The 26 cameras didn't seem final according to the article - there were multiple in the same place etc. I would suspect that they'd reduce the total number of cameras somewhat. Moreover, they've not said anything about the semis having autopilot capabilities iirc"
"Ah thanks, I was thinking it would be, but didn't know for sure."
"Basically just 5 standard chargers rolled into one, then split after the connection (granted you'll pretty much need a mechanical arm to handle the cable and the cooling that will need to accompany it)."
"> We are still a long way from a working and usable hydrogen system for vehicles.

Huh? Toyota has been leasing the [Mirai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Mirai) for years now. And a Semi should be even easier to build a hydrogen system for due to the more lax weight and space restrictions."
">Years ago elon tweeted about 350 kW charger being ""a child's toy"". So they have it in the works.

Lol, he tweeted that 3 years ago, yet till today their still installing their shared 150kW stalls. Cocky ass.
You don't need to be an economist to understand that chargers with much more don't make sense. The tech for just the charging stations is insanely expensive. A single IONITY 350kW stall costs 500 000 €. Since he calls that a ""childs toy"", the V3 would be substantially faster right, let's say double. There is no way it's worth investing a million just so your car charges to 80% in 5 minutes rather than 10. Especially when the grid can't take it without batteries as a buffer. 

But why am I talking about this anyways? V3 is already live since almost a year, Elons claim is bullshit since the V3 chargers only support 250kW peak, and guess what, the power cabinet is 1MW.

https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-v3-supercharging?redirect=no


3 MWh should be enough for 100 cars. Not everyone has a P100D or a car with a 100kWh battery, and even then, net capacity is around 90kWh for those, and I'd say on average cars will have a 60kWh gross or 50kWh net capacity. And then, you only charge from 10-80% at most, so there's that.
Add to that that Hydrogen isn't being pushed much, so not a lot of money goes into development.
I've seen it in one of Roberts videos, but they're such a pain to go through, as the labeling is quite superficial.

The thing is that we don't have the capacity for that. We're fine with just cars, but the amount of energy that would have to be stored is enormous.

I *REALLY* like the idea of vehicle to grid. I'd say that the japanese will do it first, then VW with MEB, since CCS 3 will support it.
Somwhat dissapointed that the first gen MEB cars won't have V2G, VW said they will introduce it in 2025.
Extremely disapointed Elon basically never even talked about it except one very superficial tweet in 2018 (""Very early on, we had the ability to use the car as a battery outputting power. Maybe worth revisiting that."") Does he prefer to sell Powerwalls when there's already a 50kWh battery sitting around 95% of the day?"
Then why is the picture of the Semi on Tesla's webpage a sleeper version?
I mean a 20 second 0-60 is like twice as slow as a very slow sedan. It's not necessarily *fast*.
"I'm a glass installer and I install glass on a lot of semi trucks and I talked to these guys about the semi Tesla truck, want to know what they say? The acceleration is amazing it is a huge catching point for these guys in trucks since its safer  but the range and the charging is what they worry about more."
"Back in the original presentation Tesla claimed to be able to maintain 65mph up a 5% grade at max GVW, and said that no diesel truck can do over 45. I suspect that number becomes even lower at high altitudes with the thinner air."
"Yeah, trucks going slow up mountains sucks for everyone."
I want to see some rich guy buy one just to mess around with it. Mod it and do whatever.
Surely just add more engines or a more powerful engine so that the diesel truck can go uphill faster?
Willingness to pay for any of this?
"For consumer cars, each feature has a willingness to pay value that is extremely well understood.  For example, here is a meta study of it:

https://energy.umich.edu/te3/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/Greene-Consumer-WTP-for-Vehicle-Attributes-01Jun2017.pdf

These feature lists are one of the ways automakers decide what to prioritize when designing a car.  Maybe semi trucks dont have similar studies of buying behavior?  You're an owner-operator, correct?

My understanding is that fleet buyers are actually simpler in their decision making, as they are focused mostly on application and cost per mile.  You're saying that this added feature (acceleration) would potentially shift the buying decision?  That would be interesting.

What if the Tesla Semi were offered in a base trim with all features but similar acceleration as a typical semi today, and then a Performance trim with 20s 0-60?  What should the up-charge be for the performance trim?

What I can't figure out is if the added acceleration is actually valuable on its own, or if it's simply kind of a ""kicker"" to get people to seriously consider the Tesla because it's different and cool (instead of dismissing it out of hand).  Your insight is super valuable here."
"...right, you should that constantly it as part of Continuous Improvement/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)."
"Right, I'm actually trying NOT to conflate the reasons a passenger car buyer pays for acceleration vs. why a semi buyer would.  Paying for improved acceleration is almost totally irrational in passenger cars, and if we assume semi buyers are more rational, I'm trying to figure out what the case for value is.

I can think of half a dozen ways acceleration might create value in semi trucks, but I have no idea if they're actually valuable to buyers.  Was hoping someone understood the strategy better than my guesses."
"Quite a fair statement. I do agree that the main issue has been both power (both in and out of the battery) and energy per weight and per volume as a limiting factor.

I think if we had had similar quality and price on batteries 50 years back, there would have been plenty of ways to get relatively efficient systems of variable power, though they would definitely not be as good as the system Tesla uses in the model 3 permanent magnet motor, but clearly that's a level beyond necessary. Getting something pretty efficient with the performance of a low end Honda Civic, would still have been a pretty serious market contender if it had modern batteries."
"I cannot imagine them not having some version of Autopilot for Semi. Geo-fenced, or even using the internal cameras to determine wakefulness and attention.

If there were no need for autopilot, you would see less cameras, not more."
There is more to cars then just the car. You can't fill it anywhere and there isn't anyway to make or transport or store the fuel.
"They’ll use components of 2X250 kW Superchargers to achieve 500 kW for Roadster2, SX Plaid and Cybertruck Plaid."
"> 3 MWh should be enough for 100 cars. Not everyone has a P100D or a car with a 100kWh battery,

You were talking about hydrogen. Did you forget?"
It's not a sleeper. That's all fairing.
"Yeah my dad also said about the range too but I explained to him elons plan (about the 400 miles in 30 mins charge and every 4 hour mandatory break), he told me no one abides by the legal break anyway so he doubts in terms of range Tesla could beat diesel"
They changed that to 60 now btw
"One of their big points was that the increased performance results in more distance/hour, especially in mountainous terrain, and since truckers are paid by the mile with time limitations, this means more money for them."
[deleted]
I want them to sell me a motor kit to put in a rail car.

"And then also be way more expensive to buy, run and maintain. There's a reason these trucks perform how they perform, it's a fine balance between efficiency and power. Just look at tractor pulling, they accelerate really quickly with really powerful engines, but they burn tons of fuel and the engines often break.

Electric is just superior in these cases, with the only downside being range and time to refuel. However, for relatively short distances, it might be quite a bit more efficient, because it can charge while it's being (un)loaded and is faster due to improved acceleration and speed on hills. It doesn't win in every situation, but electric is better in many situations."
I’m willing to pay for you to stop saying this... We get the point.
Time is money.
Says the person who got a std model 3. I don't know anyone who ever got that. It's like getting the $150 mo BMW lease.
"CI/CD is Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It is to promote code to progressively higher environments.

You seem to have another definition of CI/CD."
"> You can't fill it anywhere 

Sounds like a common anti-EV argument ;)

> and there isn't anyway to make

[It's super easy to make hydrogen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38ULHoKWZag) Hell, it's naturally occurring.

> or transport 

[Yes there is](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-delivery)

> or store the fuel

Again, hydrogen cars are already on the road. These problems have all been solved.

The shortcomings are it's still very expensive, it's *hard* to store in a passenger car due to size and weight (but not at all impossible), and there aren't many filling stations *right now.* That second problem is unlikely to go away, but the other two are definitely surmountable, and the second problem doesn't actually exist in larger vehicles such as semis or cargo ships. I suspect hydrogen has a great future in those applications."
"First we need to realize Tesla is behind in semi and truck EV transport. Daimler is, for example, ahead in offerings and already handed their innovation fleet to consumers for testing before entering production in 18 months.

"Step one: become rich

"> Electric is just superior in these cases, with the only downside being range and time to refuel.

I assume they'll have super capacitors on it and fully loaded the regen on downhills will be substantial, vs them needing to loudly compression brake and use the actual brakes. 

It literally might be the best use of EV tech in any vehicle."
"I am pushing because I am actually hoping for some insight into the strategy.  It might be useless, but it might not be.  Like maybe:

- Tesla is betting that acceleration was never marketed as a feature on large trucks because it never mattered before, but now that they can create a step change, fleets can start thinking about how they could innovate or operate differently.  Perhaps freight lanes and continuous routing will change if passing over the Rockies is faster and less costly, for instance.  Some businesses with heavy merchandise actually locate plants to avoid hauling over the Rockies, so a new kind of owned fleet could create a new kind of network.  This is a potential area for a first mover to gain a competitive advantage. 

- Tesla is betting that trucks that are better to drive will have higher demand from truckers, which is important given the dire shortage of drivers today - a 3PL that can fill a greater portion of loads because people want to drive for them will ultimately make more money.

- Accidents involving semi trucks are on the rise due to distracted driving, so accident avoidance systems are now becoming front and center, but most  systems like Bendix Wingman is mostly focused on braking.  Which is a good focus given that X% of accidents involving semi trucks occur when the truck rear ends a car.  Buy Tesla believes they can attack an additional Y% of accidents where a car rear ends a truck.  Safer trucks will attract drivers and also decrease cost per mile by $Z.

I was wondering if maybe they were trying to work a non-traditional angle. Or maybe they just think it's cool and want to showcase acceleration to bring skeptical truckers into the tent.  I dont know."
Ooh an ad hominem!  Fun!
"Maybe I got my CI confused with the definition of CI we use in manufacturing.  My understanding is that software engineers are constantly making performance improvements as a baseline task, which are deployed as often as possible, ideally continuously (as soon as they're ready) without having to do major releases.  Same with new features.  At least this is what my software engineers tell me they try to do.

In any event, we have gotten way off topic.  Tesla is marketing Semi acceleration as a focal point.  That's a major design feature, not a routine slight  performance improvement."
"> It's super easy to make hydrogen.

Says someone who as never done it.

>Hell, it's naturally occurring.

What?

>Yes there is

At least read your source.

""Key challenges to hydrogen delivery include reducing delivery cost, increasing energy efficiency, maintaining hydrogen purity, and minimizing hydrogen leakage."""
Yeah bro I wasn't arguing with anyone. I don't know about semi's. I was just sharing my dad's opinion because he has experience. Didn't expect to get downvoted. Is this sub like that always?
65mph -> 60mph
That is much better. That response contributes to the conversation. Do more of that and less repetitive questions.
">I was wondering if maybe they were trying to work a non-traditional angle. Or maybe they just think it's cool and want to showcase acceleration to bring skeptical truckers into the tent. I dont know.

Neither do we, and anyone who says they do is spewing bull-shit. My two-cents though, it's probably both.

For truckers who don't own the truck, they don't care about the price or savings on gas and maintenance, that's up to the trucking company. They might, however, be hesitant of electric due to the negative publicity it's getting from haters and companies with something to lose from it. For them, especially when they drive in cities or mountains, that power might save them from stopping at every light, or crawling up hills. This saves them time and stress.

To the ones actually owning the trucks, they might be more inclined to buy a Tesla truck due to the projected savings on gas an maintenance. They also might be interested in acceleration, because it makes them more effective and makes their drivers happy.

Another thing, is that it's pretty cool to be able to say the 0-60 is 1/3 that of a traditional truck, which creates buzz and free marketing. There are many reasons to put it, like you wrote before, 'above the fold' and there are hardly any downsides to it."
"You said there isn't ""anyway"" (sic) to make, transport, or store it. That is all patently False. My sources state as much.

""Challenges"" != ""impossibilities."" In fact, that whole section you quoted doesn't refute a single one of my responses."
"I was referring to the OP, wasn't taking any issue or your comment, thanks"
Sigh.  Pour one out for the socratic method.
"Hydrogen is always a simple option according to every armchair expert on Reddit.

If only we could make this very explosive gas 10 x more safe and 100 x more available and 10x more cheap it would solve all of our problems. /S

That shit is totally passive aggressive and they killed him he was so annoying.
"> Electric cars

Again. I am explicitly NOT talking about cars. I am talking about large vehicles, semis and up. There’s a reason you won’t see a BEV cargo ship any time soon... but a hydrogen one is perfectly plausible."
"True, but in milder and non dickish forms it is still a valid way to find assumptions and think critically, which is why it's used in law schools."
"I was speaking generally when I said cars. Not specifically only cars.

Hydrogen cargo ships are as plausible as BEV, or less plausible than BEV."
"> Hydrogen cargo ships are as plausible as BEV, or less plausible than BEV.

Lol, no. Source? Because [I have one.](https://spectrum.ieee.org/transportation/marine/electric-container-ships-are-stuck-on-the-horizon) And [another one.](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/16/716693006/the-dawn-of-low-carbon-shipping) BEV technology doesn’t scale that far. 

Look, I like EVs as much as anyone else, but that doesn’t mean it’s perfect for all applications, or that all other technologies can be dismissed outright."

"I knew that. But was being more geographical than political. :)

I suppose it's good to point out."
"Fired this up yesterday, pretty awesome. Got my Plex going, super cool."
"I would be hesitant to open a device-specific web site on the targeted device, particularly when that device is an automobile. 

Seems like a great avenue for exploiting device-specific vulnerabilities which could lead to compromise. 

No, I’m not aware of specific vulnerabilities but it’s reasonable to assume such exist in something as complicated as a modern web browser. Firefox was uploading ssh keys and git repos without user consent in response to visiting a site hosting malicious code just a few years ago. 

You do you, but in my book slightly different entertainment options just aren’t worth the risk.

Edit: typos"
How do i make browser full screen?
I’d wipe the screen every day
Ye can get Disney plus in yer car and I cannae even get it in ma country... God that's infuriating.
if you enjoy using your car as a home theater this is great however for the 30 minutes or so I'd be using this while charging I can survive with hulu/netflix/youtube
That is so awesome.
Wheres my most frequented website?!
Pornhub is missing!
Everyone’s dream in one screen
just tried this out for my plex access. it works great... thanks!
How does google maps look? Does it route off vehicle gps?
Are there any other such sites? Or platforms to run APIs? That sort of thing?
Where's kodi?
Very Cool
Does anyone else have an issue where full episodes don't play in CBS all access?  I went to watch the premier of Picard but it won't load anything but commercials or short clips.
Nice!  Any chance we could get HBO Now added?
"To achieve the same full screen magic (redirecting through YouTube) these portal pages are using, the following URL format can be used...

* [https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https://desired.website.url/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https://second.website.url/)

Here is an example link to Amazon Movies...

To share links with the car, I  created a Google Form. In the car, I bookmarked the spreadsheet. On my phone and computer, I bookmarked the Form. I had to change the font size of the spreadsheet to make it easier to read and mash the links.

For persistence in YouTube and to share photos with the car, I eventually created a GMail account for my car."
Can you use this while driving? That just seems wrong.
uh oh
Amazon prime video ?
Where is Prime Video
Take a look at https://MyTeslaHome.com as well.
Does it support Amazon Prime Videos?
Does this actually work when the car is driving? Wouldn't it be a major distraction for the driver and thus a safety hazard?
"Also would be a great way to collect credentials; Gmail, iTunes, Plex, etc; could be valuable.

My daughter had this happen while using a web-based proxy to bypass the school's web filtering."
"I have the same concerns as well. I'm tempted to use it to make Disney+ available in the car for my kids. But is anyone else worried, your account login info might get stolen?"
I think that's a reasonable concern.  I wonder if this is open source?  Would be cool to host it myself.
"So you haven't seen the Tesla-sponsored hackathon where the winners get $1M cash and a Model 3? Pretty sure if anything remotely close to what you are describing is possible it will be found and rectified in short order. 

Last year the winner found a minor security vulnerability (access to view limited data, I think) in the web browser and they pushed a patch in no time."
"Just saying this is 100% a concern. Having seen a video to someone opening a web page and it disabled all driving aids to enable drifting, there is absolutely everything to be concerned about with this."
"Click on the button (that's already been clicked in this screenshot, so it's not visible) to ""enable full screen"". It's down by the paypay button."
I got sick of doing this and tried a stylus then went back to finger swiping pretty quick.
"Use a matte screen protector, haven't wiped it since. Looks clean all the time"
"Groundskeeper Willie denet approoove.

edit: have been binging on The Simpsons"
Use a vpn?
that only works if you have hulu/netflix or actually care to watch random youtube videos. I on the other hand have a plex box at home. With this I can stream a TV episode while I charge and without having to go through 5-8 click to get to it lol
You bet!  Thank the guys that wrote it.  He’s here On this thread. :-)
"It’s ok...I did use it to check on an accident* up ahead when I was at a total standstill. It worked, but not nearly as smoothly as I would have hoped. You can click the little button to have it find your location. 

*The accident was a car that drove off the side of the freeway on the I-5 in the grapevine. Really steep cliff. I watched a helicopter take someone to a hospital, hope all are ok."
I have motherfrunker.ca/app bookmarked in my Tesla. I use it mostly for the Waze functionality.
Dunno.  The author of the site has responded here on this thread.  Maybe ask him?
Kodi doesn’t run in a browser like everything else you see there.
An email for your car!!!
U can go to the sites yeah. But no media will play
"Of course not. The browser locks out video codecs the moment you leave ""park"". It's illegal in most areas to have a moving picture visible to a driver."
Common sense..... no
"Amazon doesn't deliver a video stream in normal HTML5, so the browser doesn't know how to render that, unfortunately."

"EDIT: site dev worked out the issues - all good now!

First I got a warning that the connection was not secure and once I overrode that and continued anyway, I was blocked again by adguard which has the site flagged as containing phishing and malware."
No. Unfort
Negative
"Without the browser giving some kind of indication about whether you’re on a secure SSH connection, you’d have no way of knowing."
You can use Disney plus if you search for it on the YouTube app and then click the ad at the top
[removed]
Pretty sure using the browser is against the rules
If that scenario were true it would have been splashed all over Reddit and the rest of the internet. That definitely didn't happen.
Paypay button?
"I'm just imagining a driver interacting with the screen using a stylus, every day."
"do you really sit in your car while charging at home? 

maybe you should have bought a good home theater set up instead of a car"
"Wow, I hope they recover. Thanks for the info!"
"Ahh, good to know."
"I am the owner of that site, I will look into these issues.

The site does use Google Analytics to gather stats on site visit count and user demographics. I'm guessing that is what is being flagged by AdGuard. I've submitted a support ticket to them to find out for sure, and will consider removing Google Analytics if that alone is the issue and isn't a false positive.

As far as the secure connection issue, this site is new (only launched 2 days ago) so I'll have to check if my certificate is functioning correctly. Were you accessing the site with ""https"" or plain ""http""? Either way it should redirect to ""https"" but something could be wrong there I guess."
Thanks. I'll give that a try.

Pretty sure I saw something about browser exploits and keyfob attacks. Definitely not certain, but [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/01/09/can-you-hack-a-tesla-model-3-500000-says-that-you-cant/#7ddac2ab3cd0) is what I read:

> To make things even harder, ***man-in-the-middle browser attacks against the Infotainment system are not allowed***, nor are key fob relay or rolljam attacks. 

Reading it again, it specifically states man-in-the-middle, so I am not sure if this would qualify or not...?"
"I hadn't seen that yet, however I can tell you with 99% certainty that it is mostly a physical hack. That button on screen somehow interfaces with a physical switch that turns off a sensor on the car."
I sit in my car while charging at home :(
It must be a specific type since browsers are one of 5 categories. But I could be wrong.
"I sit in my car at home and  I don’t even have a home charger... Sometimes I sing the caraoke, sometimes I’m super involved with a podcast or sometimes I just love this car so much I don’t wanna get out of it."
"I have no clue, just knew I had read something about the keyfob and browser."
I usually hang in it for the comfort of the seats and surround sound when watching videos or movies. Especially when it's raining for live ASMR
"also watching movies on the tesla is underrated, you have comfy sits, great audio and a great screen, i sincerely prefer this over going to the cinema and just hear kids screaming and people using the smartphone"
Beskar?
"That’s sick!

Can I buy one?

Shipped to Australia, how much you reckon?"
That's so metal
"Looks great. All manual or CNC machine? 

Now please make a hot branding iron so we can use it on the shorts."
Wicked cool!
Nice!
That’s pretty metal
Did you make it at the Gigafactory or Fremont?
It'd make a great pole arm.

Hell yes!

This is funnier than it should be to honest
Made the same comment the other day when my wife’s model 3 showed my truck as a garbage can. Come on Tesla /s
The disrespect. Lol
"I have a friend with a Lexus, and I always like to ask him, ""How's your Toyota running?""."
DISRESPECT YOUR SURROUNDINGS
To be fair it always shows that there is a semi-trailer in my garage for a split second as I drive into my garage ... ie it's not that accurate ... yet :)
"I mean, it’s not wrong"
Lexus literally wins awards for having the best panel-gap consistency in the industry. These cars are nowhere near trash
Yeah lol
"Oh man, that's a great joke. Because Lexus is a brand of Toyota and like nobody knows this big secret right? And ugh, Toyota's they're such terrible cars. I mean not like they are 5 of the best selling cars in America."
"How so? Lexus is a trash brand?

Edit: Downvoted for asking a question? The Tesla community never fails to amaze."
Because that’s the single most important thing on an automobile.
If we were concerned with panel gaps we wouldn’t be here.
[deleted]
Loooool that’s great
See?  This guy gets it!
To be fair Lexus owners don’t want a Toyota. They paid a premium for Lexus. It is a good burn.
"Probably more so the fact that you're on a forum discussing electric cars and toyota has put out several hit piece campains dissing electric cars. But hey, you got your ""toyotas sell great"" dig in, so bully for you. You sure told us."
Actually only one Toyota model made the top 5 in sales for 2019 in US. Rav was #4 on the sales rank.
"They are good reliable cars but the joke is that many parts on various models of Lexus are labeled Toyota, and a small number of modes are sold as Toyota in specific geographies."
So you’re saying Lexus cars must be unreliable then?
[deleted]
Me too. Loved my Lexus for the luxury and the fact that it was made Toyota assured me of its reliability. It was the best car I ever owned until until my 3.
I agree!

If you had just dropped your coffee first it may have melted the ice you slipped on...where is the foresight!  /s
Well at least you looked hot doing it. Nice pants 😍
🤣 aww man! Thanks for sharing
"Actually, Tesla got your back!"
"Dude, that’s actually a pretty sweet fall catch. You could have busted your ass way worse than that. And you had stuff in your hands."
That look around at the end to check if anybody saw you
"Let's put this all over social media so we can catch this guy!

(See what I did there?)"
"Oh! At least you can find humor in it. A week after purchasing my m3, I spilled a full coffee inside my car. I found no humor. And neither did my clothes. 🤦‍♀️"
"Press F to pay respects to the coffee, may it RIP."
I’ve got the moves like jagger....
"Come on, Reddit! Let’s find this guy who splashed a Tesla!!"
Last time I dropped my coffee on the parking lot at a Starbucks I got another one for free. Did you try that?
Nice jig!
More of these please.
"lol, nice save. That could have been a lot worse....

The car could have taken the coffee."
Seriously - the most graceful fall I've ever seen!
From the thumbnail I thought this was someone breaking in your car and stealing your bag. So now I'm thankful for you falling since it seems like the better of the two...
Glad you didn’t get hurt and thanks for not leaving the cup on the ground!
Grace under pressure
"Dude those shoes are terrible on ice, but they look fuckin fly. I want some. What are they?"
No self-respecting coffee lover would have let that cup go.
"So you fell, spilled the coffee, and went back for more coffee?  Is that a safe guess?"
Tesla trolling those that dont live in CA
I love you for picking up your cup after all of that.
[deleted]
"When the pimp's in the crib ma, drop it like it's hot."
Actually did a pretty good job saving yourself from a worse fall!
Lol did Sentry only pick it up because you fell into the car? Nice catch tho I’d be straight on my ass after the first step
"
Doesn’t sentry mode have to be enabled and did it come up as an incident and save automatically?"
You can see the aggravation in the way you shut the door.
Car's looking good 👍
Naw... You're just pouring one out for your homies on lock down.
This is why I like this subreddit
Wash your car!
Did your Tesla get any damage?  Looked like your backpack made contact.
"Yeah why does it record when the owner approaches, seems like a bug here that the phone is connected while recording activity, shouldn't it disable sentry when the phone is within range and the car can be opened?"
That's epic 🤣🤣
Ironically I cannot dance...
I make the same mistake all the time covfefe is actually coverage. I’m glad I’m not the only one.
"Oh trust me, words were spoken once I realized I cannot save the coffee mid fall"
Thanks ☺️
"Thanks, but my priority was the coffee and I failed :/ 

But for real, thanks, learned how to fall during boxing lessons in college"
...yup
But I'm not hidding 🤣
"Oh I did the same, forgot a full cup of coffee in the trunk, had to shampoo it 🤣"
I would be devastated if that was my coffee.
"Actually it's just a reusable Starbucks cup, had my Nespresso in there 😢"
I refuse to waste good coffee for the sole purpose of entertainment.
It's one of those recyclable cups they sell at Starbucks
"Thanks 😊 Yeah no traction on ice...
[Call it spring - Leitso](https://www.callitspring.com/ca/en/CIS/Men/Footwear/Boots/Casual-Boots/Leitso/p/12723209)"
"I've fallen down the stairs with a beverage and only spilled a few drops. Life, uhh, finds a way."
"Please don't put it in my face, I regret still having chosen saving myself over that glorious cup!"
It was my home Nespresso and coffee at work is shit 😢 had to endure a day of agony
You don't know the struggle of keeping it clean in winter!
"Had to, it's reusable! But would have done it either way for sure 😊"
Thanks ☺️
"Neah, I went and saved the clip after a minute once I realized it was in the field of view of the camera. Knew was gonna have a laugh over it after."
Came back a minute later and pressed save on the dashcam when I realized I got my fall on camera.
I actually threw the empty cup into he floor then shut the door....work coffee sucks.
"I do it weekly, salty Canadian winters are a *itch. Also it's satin charcoal gray, so it appears worse on video than it is."
Just scraped off some dirt that's all.
"It records at all times, you can save last 10 minutes by pressing the dash cam button. I came back 1nminute after to save the video once I realized I fell in front of the camera."
"Good job OP, you have good recovery plan. Could have been worse."
Video proves otherwise ...
You can dance if you want to
I can't sing
"Sorry, lookin fresh tho!"
We did it reddit!
Oh no! Mine was more of a faulty lid scenario. My model 3 smelled like coffee for a week. Whoops!
You can understand how I felt when I saw it all on the floor....
Upvoted for the reusable cup!
"I just bit the bullet and got a ceramic coat (preventing industrial fail out is a thing in LA, leaking rusty pipes and such) At least in fair weather I can prob wash it half as often now."
Respect
awesome nice to know that pressing that button saves video from all cams not just the dash
Glad to hear that no Teslas were harmed in the making of that video  :)
You can leave your friends behind
I’m just standing here selling everything
"I got mine wrapped and I don't feel like coating the wrap in ceramic when I can just swap it in a couple of years .... But the amount of salt and dirt in the Canadian winter and just the way the aerodynamics of the car are, it gets unbelievably dirty even if washed regularly. I might consider getting the windows coated with ceramic though."
Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance
I worry about wrapping it in salty areas.  How do you know if you get salty air under the wrap?  I guess it would bubble
"The wrap is stuck to the paint, you can see an hairline if it's stuck under once the wrap is applied."
Special kind of asshole that parks in front of a hydrant and blocks a driveway. All he needed was a Handicapped sign for the Hat Trick.
Once you have your cybertruck you’ll be able to “solve” this problem yourself.
I could see a fireman routing a firehose right through both is front windows.
Live in an apartment with personal driveway in NYC. Good life you have I envy you.
"See now that's the kinda car that needs to get keyed. 

Also in Chicago where I grew up, if you did this someone WOULD smash your headlight in. If they had a crappy car they would drive into yours. 

It takes balls and stupidity and a real douce bag to do that."

Ugh.  Looking forward to the updates though.

"Probably an unpopular opinion and I know it is likely illegal, but if someone blocked me my own driveway and I had to leave, I would find a way to move the car. A winch or screwdriver and vise grips are two ways that cone to mind."
"No but seriously, 135$ for vegan food !"
I would lose my mind lol.
As a fellow new yorker I feel you
I’d be hitting their windows with a baseball bat but that’s just me.
"What I want to know is


Did they get the ticket

Did they get towed?

Is the driver from out of state? 

Would be nice to see justice here. Very wrong to ignore all signs and park that way.

I've seen lack of civic sense in NYC but usually people aren't this bad."
This happens all the time to me. I can’t stand it! It’s either they park in front of my driveway or they are taking up 2 spots a time. Btw totally random I came across this post but that hydrant and building look oddly familiar. Lol I think we might be neighbors.
But why is YouTube recommending Justin Bieber’s Yummy video though? Eww 😷
So... was the vegan food worth it?
Can't blame him. NYC is trash.
"Call police, he will get a nice ticket for blocking the hydrant"
Hybrid Camry?  Half electric car leaves half the space you needed to get out.
It's called a drunk asshole.
"It’s armpit New York, there’s nowhere to park and it’s unfit for personal vehicles"
Wait you have a driveway in NYC
"That was my first thought. I'll need to keep some tires in the bed, and a rope, so I can string them up in front of my truck and push people's vehicles around!"

"Live in Chicago, can confirm. That car would have been destroyed"
"On mobile, thought it was pornhub."
Probably not... I couldn't log in in my Model 3 because Google didn't think it was a secure browser lol
"Lived in nyc and street-parked for 3 years. 0/10, would not do again"
"""screwdriver and vice grips"" -so what's the plan with these?"
Just leave a not apologising for the damage. Don't actually damage anything.
"Naw, I carry a knife for doing those four tires. Fuggeddaboutit."
Okay so vandalism? Take a parking violation and fix it by busting out their mirrors? Grow up.
They did get a ticket. Unfortunately the driver got to the car one minute before the tow truck. So the driver got to leave. The driver is not out of state the car has NY plates.
Hybrid Hyundai Sonata*
I do not feel bad for this person. They have enough money to buy a forklift to move people

Beautiful car! Congrats. The stars were aligned for me when an SR+ popped up in new inventory on Dec 27. Bought the car late at night and they delivered from Portland to Seattle by Dec. 31. I’m feeling very fortunate. So fun to drive...
Congrats!!!
"My exact car :) congrats, you will love it."
Yup! Literally 9 hours to spare for that tax credit.
That’s a BEAUTY. Definitely my dream model 3 combo.
Another of the exact same spec orders here. Lol. I ordered mine last Friday. 8-11 weeks showing currently. Can't wait.
That’s my exact config I picked up end of Dec.  You’re gonna love it.  People keep telling me they love my wheels.  😎
Same specs here sister/brother! You'll love that!
"Their estimate for me was dead on. With that as my only data point, I would expect the same for you. Congrats!"
Nice! I took delivery of that same config on Dec 31st! Luckily I didn’t have to wait as long because I ended up finding a current inventory model local to me in Houston. You’re going to love this thing. It’s incredible. Only problem now... I need another. Because this one was for the wife unfortunately!
How do you buy your second? Do you use your own referral code or is there some other way to get a discount?
Why do the show a come delete in this pic? Is that an option now??
That’s long
"Can’t wait.  I have an SR+ too (going to wife) and I just got a sweet year end bonus so splurging on a P3D+ 

Wonder how accurate that 8-10 week window is?"
Congrats! What was your estimated delivery
I saw an uncovered trailer leave the factory yesterday afternoon. Of course I have no idea where it's going.
"Stupid request but I can find pictures from Different angles on the new P3D+ MSM, website has literally one side view and I’m jonesing to see more views - if you have any of yours you can share I’d appreciate it!"

Impressive! I also took delivery on the 31st on a current inventory. Mine took a little longer though! About a week or so. Glad it worked out for the both of us!
Good taste :)
"Stupid question, our other TM3 is SR+ with partial premium - does the premium interior have interior lights in the cabin? 

The SR+ is pitch black inside at night aside from glow of screen which is a little unnerving as I’d like there to be a little light.  

Also I’ve seen people with puddle lights, is that an after market add?"
Thanks! Mine too.  I rarely indulge myself so this is checking the box for a long time.
Good luck and god speed my dude!
"So glad I waited for the wheels, otherwise would have powder coated.  Wished it had delete like it appear the Y will have but I have a guy that did my SR+"
Hey do you have pics? I’m dying to see more than just the side view and all the new P3D I see are white.
"A lot of deliberation on color.  Wife wanted white, daughters wanted Red, I think MSM is the best color although I almost went red, just a bit too flashy for me"
I'm entering week six of a 2-3 week estimate.
I got a 3 week estimate and was driving it out of the SC on day 6! Hoping more people get a surprise like this.
Using my own referral code but that’s just for the supercharger miles and I think there’s a lottery of some sort but not sure if that’s still a thing
It’s showing chrome but I wish.
"Dunno. Heard they are pushing overseas delivery right now since the tax credit is no more. Saw a truckload of them yesterday on the interstate though. Live in Atlanta.

Hopefully the wait won’t be that long!"
Should be around March. Current orders are being sent overseas

"Happy cake day!  Sure, got a whole Youtube full of videos of the car lol.  nukem384 is my handle on YT.  My little intro has some good shots of the car too

And I made another car wash video with my foam cannon I'm putting out on Tuesday, has multiple views and angles of the car.  Stay tuned for that one.  I think that one will get you the best views TBH.

Some good ones

man silver looks amazing on these cars.  So sad they discontinued it tbh.
Team blue!!!

"Yes, you get ambient lighting. SR+ has them software disabled (there are some hacks to get those and the speakers working though...)"
"I have a 2019 SR+ and 2020 Performance. You’ll think this is the stupidest thing ever, but 2019 SR+ is outfitted with door pocket lights and footwell lights. They’re software disabled. 


Your 2020 performance will only have footwell lights... pisses me off to think my SR+ has more interior lighting with a potential unlock, but my premium interior physically has less lighting."
Any updates on yours? I had nothing in mine and noticed the local store showed a blue in stock and switched!
What’d the delete cost u on the SR+?
"https://i.redd.it/oub2pyw32b641.jpg

Not my car but basically the same thing.  mines in service rn

The wheels are like a matte color.  Love em.  look so much sicker than the silver imo"
"This is what you're gonna get:

http://imgur.com/a/InpDdHg"
"You'll not regret it, I personally think this is the most aggressive color yet the most elegant one. Your family gonna love it!"
"Yikes, Sorry to hear!"
Im in my fourth month of my two month estimate
"Hmm, the front looks more deleted than the back. The side badge looks black."
I’m hoping the over estimated not underestimated.
"Yep, with aero rims. Hope that was yours"
Nice.  Thanks for sharing. I’ll hit you up on YT
no silver was available is no longer an option.
I live in Arizona so I’m thinking the stock tires should be ok for me here (aside from wearing out fast)
"It really makes sense, I meant ambient lighting isn’t going to be the difference maker but weird that they don’t mention this so you only find out when you get it"
"Question since you have my exact dual Tesla household:

I think I screwed up using my referral code.  I ordered the car and didn’t see where to include it and immediately went to my referral link and should have ordered from there. 

Within five minutes of ordering I sent an email to referral address with my code and order number but not sure if I can add after ordering (but of course we’ll before gettting a Vin or delivery date) 

Did you encounter this or were you smarter than me (probably)"
"Nada.  Been looking for inventory to to maybe switch, would consider changing color too.  What’s your eta now?"
Think it was like $600
Sweet.  Thanks.  Way better saves me the trouble of powder coating them.  Still have to chrome delete though.  Good luck getting your whip back soon
Sickness.
"Don’t tease me with only one! Send more angles baby, I know you got em."
What is the badge on the P3D+? Is dual motor with underline?
"Ugh, the waiting is the hardest part"
Just the lighting.
"No problem.  I actually thought you had one already since I've seen you in the Tesla subs for what seems like a long time.

Here's some actual pics from my Twitter as well.

"Oddly, they mention it by not mentioning it... Ambient Lighting used to be a bullet point under Premium Interior, but it’s been removed. You’ll appreciate the foot wells when driving late at night though. It’s too dark in the cabin if your passengers need to look for something. Door pockets would have been helpful for lighting in the rear."
"Hey! I did the referral thing before so I was pretty focused on making sure I went through the process correctly lol. If you have a Sales Advisor, they can help out. If not, you would need to talk to your delivery advisor about it. Long story short, you should be able to get credit still."
Might have it this weekend! Haha. Kinda stoked. Find out for sure today
"Yea the wheels are awesome.  

Thanks but they gave me a Model X P90D so i’m not really in a huge rush to get it back lol.  This car is amazing and I’m gonna be sad all my doors don’t open automatically.   This car literally pops the door when i’m near and opens up all the way when I approach it in the right direction.  Also soft close.  

Only downside is for some damn reason no netflix or hulu.  Like what?  how? it’s a 2016 and free supercharger miles is pretty damn awesome."
"Unfortunately I had to charge the wheels 'cause winter. I went with the ts Sportline TST:

http://imgur.com/gallery/6P9mbAe

I've kept the 20"" for the summer tyres, whilst those are 18"""
Yeah
I do already have an SR+ but adding the P3D+ to the stable :)
"Exactly.  That’s when it sucks, if you drop something on the floor at night you’re screwed"
"Went to Tesla showroom and told the floor guy about my situation. He was emphatic that they stopped having access to add the referral info after and insisted he couldn’t help me. 

I pressed him until he got a manager and I’m glad I did, miracles do happen but it sounds like for the most part they will not be doing that any longer.  I think it paid off that I have a sense of humor and wasn’t a dick about it.  

Off topic, do you pictures you can share.  I can’t find multiple vantages of the car in my color, really only a side view and I’m itching to see more.  The only 2020 P3D’s I’m seeing are white"
"Good luck.  I see a white P3D inventory it’s doesn’t have the performance package but is same cost so hard pass for me, can’t believe. They’re not discount without the wheels, brakes, spoiler etc"
Those falcon wing doors while intriguing I don’t think have clearance in my parking structure.  But I do love the X
Nice!
"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5\_MA-pnr-o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5_MA-pnr-o)

Didn't forget about you, here's the foam cannon video if you want to see multiple angles of the car."
"In any case, congrats on your second model 3. I did some mild research at the LA Auto Show when I considered getting a second car. Couldn’t imagine driving anything else out there for the price. Even though my 2020 build quality isn’t the best, it really is the best all-around car out there right now."
"Too bad about the referral code. But if you charge from home mostly, there isn’t too much dollar value you’d lose for the Supercharger miles unless you planned trips around it. 


I wish I could share pics, but you’re probably looking for full performance pictures! I have a stealth model, and won’t be as fun as what you’re really looking for.


Btw, I hope you’re generally aware of some of the interior differences between the two cars you have. Grocery hooks, dead pedal, and door pocket lighting are no longer there. Steering wheel is also vegan now, so it doesn’t feel (or smell...if that matters) the same as your 2019."
"Yeah I kinda get it, but no thanks."
I didn’t get the whole hype behind the doors but I had no idea the fronts auto opened for you and closed.  You can use the key fob to basically auto open/close the entire car.  It’s super satisfying.  also when people walk by and see that they’re like...damn..what do you do for a living look
Build quality not as good as the 2019?
"I got the code, manager finagled it for me.  I get a double dip, as the referee and referer.  

I think there’s still a lottery for a free Model Y going on but I don’t think it’s random, I think it goes to whoever has the most referrals which sucks because I can’t compete with all those YouTubers and people with big social media presence (I have 3 referrals, don’t think that’ll get me a Roadster) 

Was hoping for a stealth too lucky!

I’m vegan so that’s a plus for me, 

I don’t think door pocket lights were enabled on my SR+?

What’s dead pedal?"
I have a feeling it’s inevitable that I get one eventually
"4 different rattles on delivery. 2 resolved, 2 can’t be identified. I’ve been told any further investigation will be a labor cost. I had a lot of scratches on interior panels too. It really seems to be luck whether or not you get a all-around solid Model 3 or not."
"+1 on being vegan. I’m not, but I have a great friend who is for environmental reasons. This car would be perfect for her. 


Door pocket lights exist in your 2019, but not enabled (yet...? Maybe Elon will push that for a software upgrade)


That pedal is on the left side where most people rest their foot. There is a rubber covering in 2019. Now it’s just carpet."
[deleted]
"My 2019 SR+ was relatively solid.  Paint ok, no funky panel gaps, only now after six months some weird squeak after the rain I’ll probably get checked out"
"Drag.  I kinda liked that little swath of rubber, wonder why they took it out? At least I’ll have floor mats."
Or the opposite - I have an SR+ too and a ton of people at work have every brand of ICE $40k+ car but act like I won the lottery ... I’m like “you do realize your car cost just as much?”
The cop is not doing his job. This is a felony hit and run and you have video evidence of everything. Go the police again and demand they look into this. If they refuse again go to the local news and I'm sure they will change their mind.
"YouTube video with more explanation, and talking with the cop: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDUknDUkEx0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDUknDUkEx0)

So the guy hit me, then went around me to get away as you can see in the video. I knew I had his plate, and didn’t want to pursue any more. Who knows why he’s running. I don’t want to find out.

Cop basically said not enough damage to do anything. I can’t believe the cop doesn’t want to get a hit and run (oh wait, it’s not a “hit and run” according to the cop) when I have plates… very strange to me.

So I take the cop's advice and wash off the back, go to autozone, and the employee there is basically like “Uh… yeah use something from this aisle” and suggests this random bottle which I would not have accepted if I had read the label, but I was still a bit flustered at this point.

I think I may go to a local police station and show this footage and see what they say. If they do nothing, then I guess I need to go to insurance, which since nothing seems to be wrong besides a scuff in my paint, I’m reluctant to do."
"That sounds like complete bullshit, he was driving recklessly and that rear ending could’ve pushed you into another car or sent you spinning off the road and getting hurt.

The fact that he ran away itself is clearly a crime. What the fuck is this cop talking about?

I can call the cops if someone tailgates me recklessly too... without even touching me. Surely this qualifies."
"The pickup driver is a total piece of shit. The cop is a useless piece of shit. ""Go to Autozone"" LMAO

Good luck with everything."
"People generally run when they have something else to hide. I’d pay another visit to the police station with the video, tell them your neck hurts and see if they take it a little more seriously."
"What BS, the fact he’s running is in and of itself a crime. I’d take it up with a higher authority.

I’ve done the same thing as that truck twice in my life and stopped like a normal human and in both instances after seeing no damage the driver just said forget about it.  

The last time I offered to pay for any repairs out of pocket and they never called me up to take me up on it. 

The first time the other car felt worse for me because the front of my car had more visible damage (BMW M3) this their (Honda Accord) and spent more time asking me about my car.  

That’s not a cheap truck and I doubt they don’t have insurance."
"I agree with the comments;  its not about the extent of the damage.  Laws may vary from state to state, but in PA, this would be subjected to: https://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/75/00.037.043.000..HTM.   If for no other reason than to make a point, and to cover yourself should you find that there is damage that you weren’t initially able to superficially see, wouldn’t it be worth an hour at the police station (citing a similar code reference for your state) and demanding it be pursued?   Who cares what the police officer that happened to be at the scene says? You have taken the time to gather the evidence, organize the video, and should expect humans to uphold their driving responsibilities.   If this were me, I would see it as my duty to do what I could to teach this prick a lesson if for no other reason than to give them pause in the future when they do it again and feel entitled to just run away from the hassle they have caused.  What if you happened to have been taking a sip of piping hot coffee at that very moment your were rightfully stopped, and it spilled all over you causing skin burn?    Maybe an extreme, but hopefully my point is clear... hit and run without conversation is never ok.  Never."
"I'm a motor vehicle damage appraiser and I've been hit from behind in my Model 3 [like this.](https://imgur.com/a/I0rCWwF)

The bumper and unibody structure on a Model 3 is pretty stout when hit dead-center from behind, but given the damage on the front bumper of the truck I'd be surprised if your bumper beam wasn't at least tweaked.

IDK if I'd bother with the cops, though publishing it more widely might have high entertainment value. I don't see anything here that would get any specific person convicted of a crime unless they were dumb enough to talk to the police. The owner can just refuse to cooperate or claim no knowledge of who was driving.

Your insurer should be able to subrogate it fairly easily though with all the photographic evidence."
We’re all rooting for you. Please keep us updated.
Share to news channels and hopefully publicity would pressure on the authorities to actually be constructive
This is the exact reason there should be front license plates.
What the actual fuck? Why are cops so absolutely worthless? Can you punch someone in the face and it’s not a crime if you don’t break anything?
"That seems like a hard hit, I don’t know if it will buff out. I’d be more careful and have somebody check the internal frames. do you have a photo of the damage? 

I was in a similar situation. Guy didn’t have insurance. Car looked like it had a few dings but the frame was impacted. My insurance picked up the bills, which came out to be around $15,000."
"Cop is a lying POS.  Look at him fumble for words when you say its hit and run.  He mumbles some other type of crime  then corrects himself and mumbles something else.  If he wasn't lying he would know exactly what it is called and wouldn't have to mumble it.  He even says he does these all day so he should know it exactly without having to mumble and correct himself.

He constantly cuts you off and over talks you.  yeah yeah i do this all day Ferrari's and cars way more expensive than yours.  he is belittling you into thinking this is normal and don't rock the boat.  Don't make me do paperwork.   My shift is about to end and i don't want to start a hit and run investigation.    Hopefully the media will pick this up.  This cop needs to lose his job since he doesn't want to do it anyway."
Damn you got Juked by that truck
"In most states, a ""hit and run"" is a violation of statutory laws, regardless of whether there is damage or not. While this is probably not a ""felony"" hit and run, as u/consciousmimd suggested, since there is no bodily injury, it is definitely a hit and run with evidence. The officer may not do much if there's not evidence (other than file the report, which he/she has a duty to do not matter what). I would bet that in your State this is consider a misdemeanor, but it's an illegal act, still. I don't know what State you're in, and don't know the laws in every State. Where are you located? You might also be able to file a complaint with the DA's office and your local law enforcement agency if the officer failed to report or provided incorrect information regarding your rights."
I would be shocked if AP worked after this.
What is it with truck drivers and driving like assholes? Looks like they've taken the crown from the BMWers out there.
Kick in the cop's car door. Just a little.
which app did you use to stitch the videos?
"Cop doesn't want to do work, cop fully able to 'do anything'"
"Omg dude, I’m so sorry this happened to you. I enjoy your videos and all the good you do with them. I feel like ya didn’t deserve this, man."
What an idiot for thinking he can run from a Tesla. Uneducated imbecile.
"California penal code 142
a) Any peace officer who has the authority to receive or arrest a person charged with a criminal offense and willfully refuses to receive or arrest that person shall be punished by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 , or by both that fine and imprisonment."
"You should have called 911 with the officer still there and told them his name and badge number , along with the stupid lie he just told you and demand a supervisor don’t wait till tomorrow go to the station right now if you can"
"It also looks to me like you got hit and ran. I don’t know why you didn’t just stop immediately or at least attempt to pull over so he wouldn’t go anywhere. 

Still frustrating. Sorry man."
"Geez, I'm so sorry this happened to you. This is 100% unacceptable AND incorrect response by the police officer. I would highly recommend you file a complaint against him. It makes me wonder if the officer knew the man/woman who rear ended you. He could have EASILY filed a police report for hit and run, but he seemed determined to avoid that at all costs. Maybe the driver was also drinking and driving? 

Please let us know the updates! That would be crazy if the hit and run driver had connections to the officer! Great youtube content :)"
Cop is full of shit.
Claim whiplash call an attorney then you’ll get answers
"1st stop ER for whiplash , 2nd stop lawyers office—- 3rd stop police station in neck brace and demand to speak to a Sargent or supervisor!!!"

Planning to walk into a police station with the video tomorrow
[deleted]
"Usually, if you get hit you get out of the car. OP is the one who just drove off. At least get out of the car and go talk to the other driver briefly before leaving to find a place to pull over. Or get the plate. OP literally just drove off and went a significant distance before attempting to pull over. The guy in the truck might have been thinking OP just didn’t care."
BTW a scuff of paint on the model 3 rear bumper is 1600 to fix with labor. They will likely replace the bumper and want to check for any internal damage.
"Something similar happened to me. Hit and run. Cops didn't want to do anything. Their threshold for ""not enough damage"" is physical injury.

Just get them to open a case number for you and then have your insurance take it from there. Sadly nothing much else you can do."
Agreed - that cop needs to be fired.
😂 I'm not gonna lie about the neck but I am going to a police station. Hopefully tomorrow.
What I want most is for them to be responsible. I plan to go into a station tomorrow.
Thank you. Will do.
I bet if I so much as touched his car... Arrested
"As long as you don’t do something to a cops family, you can pretty much get away with anything."
Don't apply one lazy cops actions to every cop out there.
Wow... I honestly can't get a great pic of it. I've been trying.
Ha I know but I had the plate at that point and wasn't about to hit my brakes and get rear ended again to chase some idiot
It's Michigan. It was a state officer. I'm going to try to go to my county Sheriff this week and show them the video.
Pretty sure it works fine but now you're making me second guess as I was almost home when this happened lol
DaVinci resolve on pc
Thanks man. It can happen to anyone
"The truck guy wasn’t already charged with a crime though (that we know of) which is what this law is refers to, so this doesn’t apply. I mean the cop was still wrong, but this law is irrelevant to OP’s situation."
"Good point. I would say that (assuming this statute is also present on the MI code), you'd have a hard time proving willful disregard, in this case. I would not worry about that so much as the possible damage to the car and the possibility to at least let this be a training opportunity for the officer."
Pretty nasty snow storm right now. I think I'll just let me insurance handle it.
"It was a highway off ramp at night. No way was I going to get out. I turned right and you can see immediately turned on my turn signal. He then ran from me.

He may have run me over to get away if I got out."
"Insurance fraud, awesome! And we complain why insurance rates are so high!"
"Insurance fraud, awesome!"
"Thanks, Karen."
Not sure what that has to do with anything?
"You need to hire an attorney, if police refuse to go after then you could have a case against the city and that driver. If they look at the bumper and say it’s got no damage, you claim you want driver to pay for diagnostic test to make sure sensors are all operating correctly."
Just watched your video. Please stop trying to buff this out. That cop didn't know what he was talking about and I promise you the bumper needs to be replaced. You need to insist that the police look into this. It seriously sounded like the cop was covering for the guy who hit you. He was being super unprofessional and I hope you got his information.
Get an estimate from Tesla. That will change their mind. Otherwise ask for the watch commander or shift supervisor. If that does pan out. Schedule a meeting with the Chief or Sheriff during business hours.
"Do not listen to anyone telling you to go in playing hardball. In my state apparently if it’s not worth more than $500 in damage it’s not a crime, or that’s what I was told. The officer offered to call the person based on plates though, and just the cop calling was enough to scare that person into getting in touch and paying for the damage. Playing hardball with the police should be your last strategic option, as once you go there they will no longer help you any more than their job dictates they must, and even then the help will be poor."
"Depending on where this happened. There are States that require a sworn statement indicating who was the driver and, if unknown, filing a stolen vehicle claim. In either case, this would also imply the more serious charge of making a false claim to a uniformed officer, as well as filing a false claim."
"In that case owner and their insurance carries the liability of allowing someone to drive the vehicle.  

OP should be talking to his insurance also, they are usually HAPPY to pursue another party responsible for damages when there is evidence.  Regardless of criminal implications."
You aren't supposed to get out of your car in the middle of the road if you and the car are capable of making it somewhere safe
wtf are you on
"This. You don’t know what structural damage you sustained and whether you’re now compromised if you get hit again. 

Try to pursue with police but DEFINITELY submit to insurance.   They’ll handle the rest - inspections, getting the other driver to pay for it, etc. 

The other guy may not end up with a ticket, but his insurance will at least get your car fixed."
your neck and back are filled with soft tissue. What doesnt hurt you today will likely hurt you in a couple of weeks. Was rear ended (much harder than this) didnt feel any pain at first but when I got home it hit me. Ended up with 6 bulging discs and 2 herniated
"As someone who went through this before unsuccessfully, never ever take personal injury off the table by your own volition."
Then tell them MY neck hurts.
That’s probably a better approach 😀
Call your insurance immediately if you haven’t already.
At least get your neck checked by a doctor. Even slow rear collisions can be dangerous.
I think your back hurts. 🤕
all the best.  Sorry for your hassles.
This frustrates the hell out of me. I feel your pain. Hit and run is a crime. Regardless of whatever cops opinion is.
All that acceleration for nothing smh I woulda made him think twice before running
"Got it. When you call them, if they give you any run-around, mention Section 257.618 of the Michigan Vehicle Code.

In your State what happened can be considered a misdemeanor punishable with up to 90 days in jail, or a fine of up to $100 or both."
In Michigan leaving an accident resulting in property damage to another car is a misdemeanor carrying with it 6 points on a driver’s master record.   If there was an injury it would be a felony. Source: https://www.glgmichigan.com/resource-center/leaving-the-scene-of-an-accident-in-michigan/
"The driver is almost assuredly uninsured, especially being in Michigan. Good luck"
The sensors are so sensitive on the model 3 I would make sure to give it a look/test.
thank you.
Sorry man.
Who said it was fraud? Guy rear ended him. It’s possible
F - that.... stupid hick hits your car and drives off - then the hick pig says there is no damage!!!! BS —- make um pay!!!
[deleted]
I can guarantee the bumper needs to be replaced.
You could easily lose the entirety of what you might pay for a repair if you lose with an attorney. The US legal system is institutional gambling.
I have cop's info. I contacted insurance. I'll call county police Monday when they open. State police are the ones that did not help
Leaving the scene of an accident is a crime regardless of damages
Bumper cover replacement on a Tesla is $1100
"Yup. I just said thank you and moved on. Not gonna argue with him.

I'll visit the county Sheriff (he was a state cop) and see what they say."
"if it's under $500 it's not reportable but in any accident, failure to stop and provide information is a serious offense."
[deleted]
"If OP gets out of the car and talks to that driver it’s not a hit and run. Instead, OP drove away and then the truck drove away. But I guess I’m the idiot. Meanwhile, OP is the one whining about it here and whose video footage looks silly."
"Would you have escaped that injury if you'd have completely relaxed / taken it very easy with your neck straight after the hit?

Is the injury permanent and was it in a Model 3?"
I filed a claim
I will save this. Thanks so much for the help. I'm still in disbelief the cop didn't want to do anything when I had the plates... I still think I'll send a link to the video to his phone number.
My Model 3 was rear ended way harder then this and autopilot worked fine.
Oh well. Hopefully insurance will make this easy.
"You said claim whiplash. You said nothing of going to a doctor and being properly diagnosed.

I see it all too often. Let’s be honest, while it sucks, this was a very low speed incident and the probability of whiplash is very low. Could it happen as you say, yes but without proper medical diagnosis and just claiming without any evidence is insurance fraud. Not a fan of false claims."
So that makes hit-and-run not a crime?
"I fully expect the foam inside the bumper has been at least partially crushed. It's meant to absorb impacts so if it isn't fully intact, your vehicle's safety is at risk."
"Not just bumper but what about all of the plastic bits underneath the bumper as well as shock absorbers. Once those are damaged, they must be replaced. It's what you can't see that will need to be repaired/replaced."
You can’t make that claim without seeing it in person.

"That may be accurate according to the laws, but unfortunately reality plays out differently, which is why I’m providing the information on what happened to me in reality. The officer that responded to me was very, very kind, but still told me the above rules, so people should be prepared for the human beings that sometimes don’t memorize or fully understand the law as it shows up on paper."
"Nearly all damage seems to cost 500 or more, it’s just that the police are in no position to assess that, so they tend to assess it as under $500 so they can move along."
"Most States have statutes that include violations like the ones I listed (providing a false statement, filing a false claim, etc.) The question is whether there was enough evidence (like a license plate) to pursue the owner who, let's face it, is usually the one behind the wheel or knows who is and will be happy to not take the hit: remember, also, that if the owner is really not the driver, he/she will be happy to tell the authorities who was, since the commission of a unlawful act that results in insured damage is never covered by the insurance company, so the owner of the vehicle is most often stuck with the bill.

I hope this (very convoluted) answer addresses your question!"
"It clearly wasn't a safe place to stop. After a minor (no actual injuries) hit you're supposed to get to a safe place to inspect the damage. It was clear that the pickup driver wasn't planning to pull over (since he was in the far lane and accelerating away. Its plainly obvious the way he finally darts across two lanes to make a sudden left turn (because hes a coward). 

Watch it again."
"They should handle the rest. It’s driveable. Don’t “fix” anything. They can find him with the plates the same way the police can. 

On a hit and run we had with my wife’s car, a Good Samaritan got a photo of the plate, the woman, and the damage (with bonus of her door rammed into the Porsche on the other side of her car from us). We filed, the called, they took responsibility immediately. On ours it was the rear quarter panel; it ended up being $4400 of damage (MB R350)."
"Unfortunately sometimes law enforcement officers don't know the law. Most are really good at it, and the vast majority really care, but there are a few who don't know the law and/or not care.

I hope it all goes well. I would also contact your insurance company to tell them you were a victim of a hit and run and provide the name of the officers that showed up."
"You can’t detect whiplash...going to a doctor your just telling them you pain level and where it hurts. They’ll ask you what may have happened and then point to the accident there no official diagnosis, besides the doctor saying it."
But I can. And I did.
"Fair enough, you should provide OP that aspect of your advice, you said hire which I based my statement on."
Dang. Well let's hope it's that easy 👍
I filed a claim on my phone and sent the dash cam footage. I assume they'll call Monday.
"There are tests that can be used. That’s not how modern medicine works.

So by your thinking since you don’t think it can be detected then claiming whiplash will get you a payday?"
"Sure, baseless but you did."
That car has been hit twice while parked. First was that hit and run. Super easy. Second time we walked up right after it happened and the other driver was in the middle of making a note. Interestingly the second round was more of a pain in the ass to deal with insurance wise.
No there isn’t...it’s “damage to soft tissue” your not going to get an MRI for minor neck pain. And the other insurance isn’t going to ask for it as it’ll just cost more if it’s there. We’re talking minor discomfort nothing more
"Or it could be based on the fact that I was also recently rear-ended in a very similar way and had an extensive discussion with the tesla certified repair shop about why the bumper needed to be replaced. The bumper needs to be removed for inspection regardless and if they keep the same bumper the additional cost of sanding, filling, and painting will exceed the cost of a new $400 bumper. I have also spoken to many other people about minor fender benders and it seems to be the standard protocol for any damaged bumper"
Ok
Ok
"I didn’t have snow tires last year and my AWD did pretty damn good, I put snow tires on it this year and now it mobs through snow like it’s glued to the road. You still have to be careful stopping, but it’s way better than the traction i’ve had in 4x4 vehicles."
Do you have AWD?
Drives like a camry unless in track mode!
"I live in Alaska. Have AWD, no snow tires and OEM 18inch tires. It does great, cant seem to get stuck, traction control is wonderful. However, and its a big one, without snow tires the weight of the car slides it when needing to brake with sudden force and I have been avoiding going down the steep snowy hills as much as I can. Also slid on a turn I took a little faster than I should have and the car got grip right in the nick of time but that was pure luck. Next year I'm getting snow tires and am looking forward to a good experience getting safer and better.

Also OP I enjoy your videos. They might have nudged me into getting mine sooner than later."
It doesn't handle ice very well tho. Trust me. I had to buy winter tires to feel safe
"Can confirm. The AWD handles like nothing I've ever driven in snow. Even when it's sliding a little, you have almost total control over the direction you want it pointing. Not saying a whole lot about me since I've only driven front wheel drive ICE cars without stability/traction control lol"
Where do you wash your car in the winter? At home?
"My only worry is about the snow clearance. How high does the front sit off the road? Am I able to drive through more than 6-8 inches of snow or is it only patted down / already driven on roads?

Planning on ordering either a M3 LR AWD or a M3P this summer. I live in the country, in northern Illinois and unfortunetely my roads don't always get plowed before I leave for work. I currently drive a Jeep Cherokee 4WD and it does fine, plus its the Limited so it doesn't sit higher like the trailhawk."
"As a Canadian I only have to ask, where's the snow?

Needs at least another 8"" to be called snow.

Seriously though it handles great, even in 10+ inches of snow."
"Primacy MXM4? How are they on ice?

I thought they were ok on snow, had a slight lateral slip that may have been my fault. I’m only in snow/sub 45 temps a few days a year because of ski trips, so gotta stick with all seasons."
My SR+ with snow tires is a beast!
"Assume that is an AWD. My Sr+ handles pretty horribly. It is RWD and is expected to be worse than the AWD, but the traction control is just terrible. It  just cuts off power to the wheel in the middle of a slope every time and I slide up and down the hill praying I don't hit the brick wall. Even couple of inches feels like a snow storm in this car. Really need snow tires, no way to survive without that."
[deleted]
Snow tires are an unbelievable difference
Yep!
"Not OP but I don't. I am sure it would help,  but you really don't need it with winter tires since these cars handle snow very very well.  It's almost impossible to make it lose control even on purpose.(to my dismay)"
😂 Thanks a ton! I'm definitely getting winter tires next year! Alaska sounds awesome.
"I love flooring it and the car's like ""na that's dumb"" 😂 😂"
He’s u/DirtyTesla for a reason! 😃
I have been using a waterless car wash but now that there is salt on the ground I spray it at one of those self service pressure washer places first.
I usually don't lol. I was in a hit and run and the cop told me to go through the car wash :P But there is a self wash place near my house I'll go to if I need
"Model 3 LR AWD ground clearance is like ~5.5"", performance is ~5.1"" and you get the larger tires (worse in snow I've heard.)  Either model can get a 1.75"" lift for $500 (plus install, alignment) [here.](https://www.mountainpassperformance.com/product/mpp-2-suspension-lift-kit-old/)

If I were you I'd consider the P3D- instead of the P3D as it should be ~5.5"" clearance."
"Ground clearance is ~5.5""

I haven't had a problem yet. It's higher than my last car (Ford Focus)"
Already plowed and packed down 😉
"Yeah. They do great. I was trying to slide around omw home on the back roads today and while not as good as snow tires, it's easy to keep control."
Snow tires are magic. Had them on my Ford Focus and it was amazing!
"Just cause you have this fancy 3, doesn't mean it can do everything automatically.  If you have crappy tires on the car, or crappy all seasons, that's your issue.  It's not the car.  Esp if you only have RWD, definitely get some snow tires.  It will make a world of difference since the rubber is softer and made to handle extremely cold conditions.  I learned this the hard way back in the day when I had my WRX STi, thinking I was all hot, had my summer tires on in the snow, yeah, lucky I didn't crash into someone that day as I was sliding left and right and up and down too, in a beast car made for every type of condition.  Grip matters."
"Yeah, you definitely need snow tires.

Ive been waiting for some wheels that finally just arrived today. I was gonna snow tire the aeroes and summer tire the new wheels but now that they're so late.... Considering waiting until next year"
Snow tire is required! I have sr+ and I'm okl
"from .1 to 4"" the snow capabilities of cars act the same.  

you need to learn what slip is"
"What tires do you have and how worn are they? I have a long range RWD with stock continental tires and am having traction problems too, but I found out my rear tread is around 5 / 32 which is apparently too low for decent snow traction. I'm considering upgrading to a better all season tire."
Yeah-huh
"Truth here, at least with the 19s and RWD. I always try to work from home when their is a chance of snow, but I hit a snow squall the other week and it was horrible. I almost totally lost the backend of the car a dozen times over 5 miles doing 25mph. 


I knew car wasn't going to be good compared to my old WRX with snow tires and awds, but it was shockingly bad. Even my wife's RAV4 on stock all seasons is much better.


Needless to say, I will not drive it in the snow again until I get snow tires."
"I drove through a Texas snowstorm two winters ago. I was returning to California after visiting my mom for Christmas, and the snow (on the highway!) was *almost up to the hood* of the model 3. I kept passing other cars and trucks that had spun out and were waiting for assistance, but I never lost control once.

That was with OEM tires, and I don't even have AWD."
"Didn't even see your username, I knew you had AWD from your videos :) 
I'll be ordering my M3 AWD soon and wanted to know how it fares over snow since I drive through the mountains in Colorado for work everyday. I'm guessing the weight of the battery helps quite a bit too!"
Winter tires is the key there.  If you have AWD you can get away with all season tires and feel like snow tires.
"It's so much better than other makers' traction control. Electric motor instant torque also means instant optimal torque up to the limit of traction. Beauty of electric motors which can be modulated so much faster than mechanical ICE+brakes.

Mercedes Benz traction control just kills all power to the wheels when car starts going sideways and pressing the gas pedal does absolutely nothing for couple of seconds. Basically dead duck until power is allowed back to the wheels. Very binary knee-jerk traction control, instead of more progressive power management."
"There's a touchless place I've been taking my car to, but it just gets dirty again with the salt and shit right after I drive off. It's pretty frustrating. I feel like I should have done ceramic coat or something."
"See those little shrubs off to the left there, the fact that I can see those tells me you don't have much snow.   


Picture for reference: [https://i.redd.it/eihya9zssrb41.jpg](https://i.redd.it/eihya9zssrb41.jpg)"
"Wow, that's impressive. Are they new by chance? I wore mine down halfway at 10k miles.. :(

Can't find the link right now, but there's a consumer reports article that states all-seasons lose about 20% of their winter traction at 'half life.'"
"This is what I did. Aeros+winters for the range boost in colder seasons, while also deferring the cost of new wheels into the spring time!"
Thank god. I may move somewhere with snow and want my SR+ to work there.
"It's best to just have snow/summer or snow/all season. You aren't spending extra money as now both sets last longer because of split mileage.

If you've never used snow tires, it's quite amazing. Since my 3 doesn't have snow tires yet, if we go somewhere and it's icy or slippery snow, we take my wife's front wheel drive equinox because it's safer."
"All seasons are not good enough if it gets under 45 degrees where you live, atleast with a model 3 rwd.  I didn't feel safe going to work until I got snow tires.  It's not about the traction or the depth like most believe, it's about the temperature the tires are designed for."
RWD is bad all around for snow. But the Tesla due to its battery spreading the weight well does much better than any other RWD. That being said it can never compare to FWD vehicles or AWD vehicles. The AWD 3 is an amazing vehicle to drive in snow.
[deleted]
To be fair dirtytesla's car is uncharasticslly clean after the hit and run. Lol
:P it really kills it. Still would be better with snow tires.
Mine does amazing except for that the car gets stuck when the snow is too high. But the car the amazing in snow.
Standard wheels handle fine. I have the performance 20s and have snow tires for winter. Performance ones aren’t for snow but 18s will do good
"AWD is never a substitute for winters. Might help you start moving, certainly won’t help you stop"
Have an AWD and go skiing every weekend.  You are very very wrong...awd and all seasons are absolutely no substitute for snow tires or chains...many dead families believed that.
Having driven through Canadian winters in all kinds of different cars I would take a RWD Model 3 with snow tires over AWD without.   If you get AWD and you live somewhere with real winter get snow tires and it will be a beast.   I don't understand why someone wouldn't.   Sure you have the cost but buying snows will mean you extend the life of your other tires.   Plus when you finally need to replace the stock ones you can get better summer or performance tires instead of all all season that are just okay in most conditions.
"All cars have AWB (all wheel braking)... AWD just gets you into trouble faster.

Get snow tires :-)"
Same... probably gonna do it myself when it warms back up.
😂 Amazing
"I'm at 29k miles but got these at like... 14k miles I believe? Somewhere around there, I don't remember. I've been checking with a gauge and they're getting close to low, but still doing ok."
"With the weight of an EV you have more control than any other ice car. Sure on acceleration an Awd is better, but the problem is when you want stop or turn.
When there is snow I made profil snow.  So it keeps my settings (mirror, steering....) but switch to chill mod and soft regen"
Yeah I'm still considering a separate snow tire set as an alternative to a good all year. What snow tire are you planning to install?
"It’s been below 45 degrees here in Chicago for weeks, including some frozen-over slushy snow. My SR+ with stock tyres has been okay. Not as fun as in the summer, but still more fun than any other car I know. 

If you are a careful driver (and you should be regardless of the season), RWD + stock tyres is fine. Just make sure to have some cat litter :)"
"No BS. I was quite nervous because I'd never driven through a snowstorm before, so I took it slow and steady, often going as slow as 10-15 mph as I plowed through the deep drifts.

I think it's because of the weight of the car, primarily."
You drive around on this surface without snow tires?
"It's amazing how many people don't know this isn't it?   It's not just a Tesla thing either, I try to inform everyone I care about but I'm often met with hostility at the suggestion someone should spend more money to make themselves and their families safer.  I feel like it could literally save lives so I do it anyway.   

All seasons are made to last longer and a side effect of that is they lose almost all traction in freezing temperatures.  It isn't about tread or depth or awd....the difference those things make is tiny in comparison."
I think many people think this because the car feels planted...but it always feels good until it doesn't. Try having to do an emergency menover in snow with the stock tires and you will quickly find they are not adequate when they need to be.
People forget how good RWD is in winter conditions with appropriate tires.  The only reason people think AWD is a necessity for winter life is because they had too many FWD cars in their lives.
Good to hear! Thanks
Nice - smart.
"Cheapest ones with good ratings that I can find lol. Liking the altimac arctic 12 but looking for a bit cheaper.

But I'm most likely waiting until next year at this point."
"That's interesting actually as the delivery specialist in Chicago told me the same thing. I wonder if it's because the roads are more traveled/plowed better in the city?   Or maybe people are just used to how cars drive without snow tires?  After our first big snow in Indiana I noped out and got snow tires.  I mean,  it was drivable but not fun and it felt like it was a matter of time before I got stuck.   I now feel no need to keep cat litter or call off work."
Yep
Would you suggest getting winter tires and switching them off once the snow and ice is done for the year?
"When I told people in Michigan I was getting snow tires, most people hadn't even heard of them, and most others said it was a waste of money.

I don't know why. I freaking love winter tires. They make driving in snow so much more fun and confident rather than scary."
I live in Quebec and there is a deadline to have actual winter tires on your car. If you get caught with all seasons or summers in december you're getting a ticket.
I got the artimax artic 12's  from pepboys eBay store for $500 and they do great!
"Chicago generally has its act together about cleaning snow off quickly. The biggest problem is alleys — those can be a bit of a mess, but usually not terrible. So yeah, stock Primacys do okay. 

I will probably get real winter tyres next year, when my stock tyres are more worn."
"Yep, but it's not just about snow/ice.   A good rule of thumb is to change to winter tires once temperatures consistently drop below 45°F. I won't lie it's a pain but totally worth it, and as it turns out summer tires are also way better then all season so you can upgrade those too once the stock tires wear out, which will take a lot longer now."
Same here in Indiana!   I hope you make a video on it when you get those tires.  It seems to be a hot topic for Tesla's.   I think I am a few hours from you if you want a RWD to compare with.
Definitely not a waste I had the 20 winters put on here in Chicago and it’s 100% better than an all season
Awesome ty!
That'd be awesome! Do you have winter tires? I'm waiting until next year
"Yup.  The Altimax Arctic 12 with no studs.   I went with these due to the great price I found but I have been impressed.   One thing to note is that they are not great performance wise.  They feel sloppy in sharp turns, and I can't even get full power out of the car even on dry pavement as traction control will kick on.  For normal everyday driving they are fine and you don't notice it, but  for ice/snow they are amazing."
"Well, sounds like snow tires 😂"
Where was this? Mine got hit and the dude looks similar. Same tool.
"Did they see the “you’re being recorded message” and leave?

Just a reminder. Leave nothing in plain sight."
"Looks like they couldn't figure out the doorhandles 😂 Best anti theft device

But glad your baby is all ok."
oh shit. that's close to me. Thanks for posting. yikes.
"People like this deserve to be dragged behind the cars for a couple of miles.

Joking but the feeling is they deserve severe punishment to deter others in future too.

Why are humans so scummy? Especially to others."
Damn....literally dodged a breakin.
"It looks like there was someone else in the parking lot that he acknowledged as he walked away. Also, it's a good shot of his face and some very distinctive hand tattoos. This should probably be reported to police."
"Also, for anyone willing to help out, we could use some upvotes to help identify these guys over at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/eitxpu/need\_help\_identifying\_two\_thieves\_in\_the\_mueller/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/eitxpu/need_help_identifying_two_thieves_in_the_mueller/)"
"Wow, this is crazy"
Parking garage in Austin's Mueller area.
I think I have the same tool in my car. It's like $10 off Amazon. Let's you smash windows in case you need to escape your vehicle. Also cuts seatbelts.
Precisely.
Very true the door handles are a pain in the butt because I Uber nobody knows. I have to explain how to get it out literally every time.
at least 22 miles
"Yes, it's been reported to the police with abundant footage of the two thieves at many angles including breaking into two nearby vehicles."
jesus.  what a bunch of jackasses.  hope they get caught.
"Oh ok, if you said San Jose CA I would have opened the cold case lol"
"Yup, exactly what that tool does."

Me too
"FYI, I put the same on my car, still have issues with passengers, because the window come down a little they panic and think they hit the wrong button. 🙄
Also the ones for the emergency release, just attract more attention to it and they want to pull that. Again 🙄"
Site seems to be down they are little door open decals
Lol of course
"Ok, I'll check it out a bit later then thanks!"
Lemons are not uncommon in the car industry and thats why we have laws to deal with them. It sucks that you have had a bad tesla experience and even worse that you have given up on them. None of it is your fault. Hope you get this resolved quickly one way or another and that you remain an EV driver one way or another.
"Cold weather brings pests (mice) into the shelter of the undercarriage of the car. They can nibble at the wiring harness which leads to all sorts of issues. IMO, that could explain why seemingly unconnected components are failing all at once.

Keep your eyes peeled for signs of mice.

The good news is, this doesnt mean you need to replace the sound system, the windows, the screen,  and everything else that's breaking. Just the wiring harness."
The worst part is that you are having  these major issues and they can't see you.  I would just drive there and not leave til they dealt with me.
"I feel you pain! I am a July 2018 delivery owner. I’ve had 9 repairs done to my model 3. 7 of them fixed by Tesla and covered by the warranty. 2 of them were denied by the warranty (seat stitching coming a part and sunroof cracked). 

The service department is non-existent and the service is horrible. The mobile tech knows me now from repairing my car so often.

I’ve been repair free for about 2-3 months now, I hope I can continue this streak for another 5 years. 

It’s an awesome car to drive and love the tech, but we are part of a new company and there will be growing pains. I believe things will improve with time."
Did you try a reset already? Usually the first thing to try if something is odd.
"As a tesla owner myself, i find it so annoying that everyone downvotes issues.. fanboys are the worse.. today there was some guy here to posted what elon had tweeted Happy New Year.. SMH"
"Did you try just showing up at the service center? If you're not too far away it's worth a try. When I called in with a punctured tire they told me not to bother making an appointment, just drive in before it goes flat. If the service guys see that the car is barely drivable they may take it."
"If you try the penthouse reset, let us know how things go. Good luck. How old is your Tesla?"
You just got a bad software or firmware glitch.. it'll probably be able to be fixed with a wipe and fresh install or possibly just an update. I was having some problems with my air conditioner not working and it turned out it was a firmware problem with a glitchy update somehow. Got a new update push to me and it solved it. Hopefully it's that simple for you too! sorry you're having trouble.
"I upvoted this. Few thoughts to share. I believe all these conditions exist at the same time

1. It really sucks you are dealing with this. Sorry. 

2. There are sometimes lemon products. It’s the luck of the draw. 

3. No one should be downvoting this thread. This stuff needs to be heard. 

4. When it works right, I still think the model 3 is the best car in its class by many metrics. 

5. It’s shitty how Tesla still has such bad support stories. I have personally had pretty decent support experiences. But I did have to wait once for 2 weeks for an available service appointment. It wasn’t important so I didn’t mind waiting. But they need to dramatically step up their support game. Especially before truly going into global mass production. I am sure they have a plan for it and are working on it. But it’s shitty that this is still going on. 

I have two cyber truck reservations and plan to make a fleet for my companies of Tesla’s and stories like this make me second guess it. Even being a fan. Everyone should upvote this so maybe someone from Tesla notices. This isn’t fud. It’s legit and Tesla should work on this harder."
That really sucks! And to have to wait such a long time for service when your car is basically not operational is ridiculous. I've not had to deal with this - is there an escalation process or can you try calling customer service? Either to get an earlier appt or a loaner in the meantime? With any other car you could just go to a different shop and get it looked it so that is definitely a limitation. I love Tesla and always advocate for them but this is one of the things they need to figure out as the grow. Good luck and keep us updated!

"I has the screen crashing issue and turns out the problem was my USB/SD Card I had plugged in for sentry mode. 

Do you have one of those in? Maybe try removing it and doing a hard reboot (both steering wheel buttons in while holding the brakes)."
"Call Tesla roadside assistance. Tell the vehicle is unsafe to drive and have them tow it. Appointments are for minor issues, you need major surgery."
"Was considering a Model Y for the wife next year, but if this OPs experience with his car is typical, I’m going to hold off until Tesla gets its act together."
"I definitely feel your pain. While I definitely enjoy driving the car, the autopilot, and all that jazz, it is frustrating to bring up issues and annoyances with the vehicle and have them shouted down/downvoted into oblivion.

I have a colleague who also owns a Model 3. Now, to be fair, he does not DD it, his wife is the daily driver. But whenever I bring up imperfections, he tells me I'm being too sensitive or it's not a big deal. I'm like, yeah, sure, maybe, but they're *still issues* that I have to deal with.

For example, on some rough sections of pavement, the body has more rattles and strange creaks and groans than I would deem acceptable in a one year-old vehicle, let alone a $50k one. Then he tells me I'm being too sensitive and it's just because I'm not used to the quiet of an electric vehicle, for which he conveniently forgets that I drove a Nissan Leaf for almost 4 years and never really noticed any undue creaking or groaning.

So, again, I agree with you. We can both love Tesla and how they're dragging other vehicle manufacturers kicking and screaming into the next era of automotive transportation with the best drivetrains and technology, and we can also hate them for the mid-80's Hyundai assembly quality and general non-drivetrain engineering.

At this point, I can only hope they get to 2020 Hyundai-quality levels faster than Hyundai did."
[deleted]
"yeah this is a huge risk right now with tesla. quality control isn't where it should be (for the price) and replacement parts are long lead time items. sucks, hope your situation improves soon"
"You say you’re in Canada, so I’m not sure how it would work there.  But after a few reasonable attempts to get the car fixed and working in normal order, I would contact a lemon law lawyer and get the ball rolling on that as (in the US) in can be a long process.

My mom went through it with a Volt.  It had so many computer/infotainment issues it was really inexplicable.  I own a Chevy Volt as well and I haven’t had a single issue with mine, which just further proves that some cars are just lemons."
"Just have to chime in and agree that the fanboy aspect of Tesla subs is annoying AF. In my first week of ownership, I posted/commented about how keys/phone could be locked in the car easily, and was berated for it. 

Also, my local SC (Denver) is unable to pick up a phone call or return one. They simply do not respond. Guess they’re too busy selling new cars to help existing customers."
"Just press roadside assist. Tell them you are not comfortable driving a car without a speedometer or warning lights, they will tow and fix for you. Totally reasonable."
"Yeah.  You’ll find that anything but blind allegiance to Tesla no matter what is met with anger and a misplaced sense of loyalty to a company that doesn’t give a crap about them.    Sooner or later someone will call you a short seller or big oil shill, that’s when you know you have made the big time."
Seems they have more issues in the cold?
"Both sides. 

Good—my model 3 is a phenomenal driving value compared to my previous Acura. Faster, more fun, more efficient, same purchase price. Fantastic overall. 

Bad—Tesla has nothing in Acura reliability. Not even close. My 3 month old Tesla has already spent 8 days in the shop due to the front subframe falling off. Yes, it came apart. It felt like a super-worn/broken front rocker arm, but it turned out they had simply not torqued the bolts holding the front subframe in place during manufacturing. 

The fix required fully disassembling the front end, dropping the motor, etc. and needless to say it makes one wonder what else is going to fall off the darn car. These are not concerns Acura/Lexus owners feel, ever."
"I didn’t hear you mention anything wrong with your other Tesla, have your issues been with only one of your cars?

I’ve had to deal with the service center once and I fortunately had a good experience there. Also the mobile tech that initially came to help me was awesome. But yes, I’d agree that their call center needs a bit of work. I hope they invest in some better training tools and leadership that can make their service as awesome as their cars when they work."
Are you close to a service center? Get it in there. Don't wait for the appointment.
"Thanks for this, I’m sorry you’re having such bad luck. Try to remember that you have another one that works a lot better. Also, it sounds like just a broken piece of hardware, CPU or memory, and should be easy to fix. BTW, I think it speaks to the safety of the car that it still drives, so even a major malfunction probably wouldn’t cause an accident. 

I have no real help to offer though, but if you have the time, please do try the penthouse reset and report back how it worked. I’d like to be wrong about the defective hardware. 

In the meantime, this reminds me to be thankful how flawlessly mine works most of the time. Just a hiccup here and there."
Bruh I wish I had enough throw away money to lose thousands on cars after a bad week.
Get a loaner 3 or S in the meantime?
"Try to remove any mass storage media and other usb devices, they can cause serious issues. Could also be damage to your wireharness by rodents. Any animal traces on your car or a known problem in your location?"
"This sucks a lot, but don't cancel that truck! You're having a bad time, and yeah service hasn't been good lately, but you just need to remember to book for all the little things, and then when they fix them via a firmware update or software update they'll cancel the physical appointment, and if stuff crops up that real you'll have something in the pipe.

I used to try to wait and be all nice about holding off until I had enough stuff, but this is a learning time for Tesla. It's up to us to teach them. They'll get better but only if we keep teaching (and complaining) about how the service is working out for us."
"Have you taken any steps in solving the issues? I know we have very little we can try as owners but I would start with the 12v battery, have it tested at Auto zone, or a complete car reset by unplugging the high voltage battery under the rear seat. In my previous car, Range Rover, any drop in voltage would cause everything to go haywire, random warning lights would go off, radio wouldn't get signal, air suspension wouldn't work, etc."
"Stories like this make me feel extraordinarily lucky in having a problem-free Model3 so far. It does sound like you got a lemon and you ought to take advantage of the lemon law to dump that car. Of course any car can have problems, or be a complete disaster, but that's when the support and service side of the company has to show its mettle. I hope your problems are resolved soon, one way or the other. I would not have had the patience you have had with all the resets and reboots and driving with no screen and all the rest!"
You have an issue that Tesla hasn't even had a chance to resolve and you want to sell the car?
When will Tesla drive by itseld?
I’ll take it off your hands for that $1000 you were talking about.
Sounds like you bought a lemon.  That's what the lemon law is for.  No harm
"That really sucks, and is probably even dangerous. Sorry you have to deal with this. Also, upvoting, as people need to see when stuff like this happens."
"Just curious if you have tried just driving to the service center and saying you can’t leave until it is fixed or you have a loaner because it is too dangerous to drive?

And/or the penthouse reset?"
Maybe your 12 volt battery needs changed. Alot of those things you mentioned are controlled by the 12 volt battery.
"So some of these things have occurred to me, too, but less dramatically. This seems to coincide with the latest software upgrade. I had a window (apparently) open itself; had the screen unresponsive and off for about 30 seconds (not a big deal in my case); the backup camera shows a black screen with two lines and no image about half the time. Unpredictable. Mine’s a 2020 SR+ Model 3 in case that matters. Let’s hope others have complained also. I’ll plan to call tech support in the morning. Sorry for your misery. I suspect it will be sorted soon..."
[deleted]
"I understand being frustrated but after reading through all the posts here and your responses,  it’s clear that is a shit post.   You have an excuse for every solution thrown at you.  In one breath you say you are walking away from Tesla,  in the next breath you are trading for the model Y."
"I think you should be pushing for immediate service. Also keep in mind the car seems to have a failed computer, which is a pretty integral part of the car. It doesn’t sound like it’s plagued with different issues. Hope you get it sorted out!"
"Honestly, this isn’t a Tesla issue so much as cars packed with technology. Everything being digital is awesome as a tech enthusiast, but you are experiencing the side effects. It’s worth the hassle for me personally, but an electrical issue can really mess up your driving experience."
"You quite literally have had 11 days of what is likely one problem with your Tesla; most likely a faulty logic board.  I’m not sure what your rant is about.  How about giving Tesla one attempt to fix your car before complaining on here. And as others have said, if you deem this making your car unusable, bring it up to the service center without an appointment.  Or call their executive offices.  Take active measures. 

But instead because of one yet unseen repair by Tesla you have concluded “I'm contemplating selling my two teslas and cancelling the cybertruck.”  And you wonder why this overreaction caused some down votes.  

I had a 2010 BMW 750 that was in the shop more than not for 6 months.  I got BMW to buy the car back as a lemon. It happens.  It didn’t make me forego any other BMW purchase.  Cars sometimes are lemons.  But you are not even close to that under any state lemon law where the same (or multiple) serious problems are not fixed after multiple attempts. And almost every state law requires giving one last chance after written notice to the manufacturer.  You started having problems not even two weeks ago. 

So, with all due respect, chill out and let Tesla have at least one chance to fix your car before you trash the brand."
Sounds like Tesla gave up to on him.  To have this type of issues and be put off like that?
Woah. This could totally be a thing. Didn’t occur to me but it’s be toasty warm under the car wouldn’t it?
Just had to replace wiring to the headlights on my grandfathers Cadillac because mice chewed through it. He lives in U.P. of Michigan.
"It's a 3 and a half hour drive one way. With no screen at times, it's a little dangerous. Could also cost me a ticket, as I don't know how fast I'm going."
"Yes, thanks. 

I've done countless resets. I have it all documented on video and will type it out all soon for the Mobile Ranger to review when he comes out. 

From December 20th until now I've done approx 20-25 resets. I'll have a better idea when I review all the videos I made and document them all down on paper. I did all kinds of resets from the popular two scroll wheel resets, to brake and scroll resets, and even the on screen power off and wait for 4 minutes and press the brake to turn on. Sometimes resets brings back sound, most of the time it doesn't, and a lot of the times the screen just goes black and doesn't come back for hours."
"My favorite ever post in this sub was the time someone uploaded pics of inside the gigafactory during the model 3 production hell period. They showed random parts strewn around, and generally made it look like the assembly line was disorderly. 

The OP tried to delete all the pics as soon as the post blew up, apologizing and saying he was sorry he posted something that might be bad for the company. He basically admitted to being a fanboy and only ever wanting to promote a pro Tesla agenda within this sub, rather than any attempt at sharing unbiased truth. 

That’s what this sub is."
They said elsewhere it's a 3.5 hour drive
Happy cake day.
"I will try that after the Jan 8th appointment, if they can't figure it out. My other backup plan is to trade it in for a Y or something."
"Thought so too, but I've had a software upgrade since this all started, and didn't help."
"I agree 100%, talking to someone is nearly impossible. My nearest service centre has a phone number, but when I dial it, it automatically forwards it to Tesla and have to go through a ton of menus which all end with, check out the website...goodbye. So I tried another service centre that was a bit further and same, I dialed their number and it forwards me to main Tesla. I'm in Canada and finally was able to speak to someone on the Tesla phone and they tried to book an appointment with me somewhere in the United States. I'm like no, I'm Canadian, then they tried to book me an appointment in 4 provinces over from mine, which to put into perspective, it would of been a 2 day drive to get there. It's like I live in Florida and they tried to make an appointment for me in Texas. It's just a mess over there."
Amen to that. Tesla service has been a nightmare for me too. Just a call center - or a person answering the service center phones. Just a human. That would help substantially
After growth tapers off? They need to realize it now.
"Thanks, just tried that. Unhooked both my SSD and phone charging pad, did a hard reset, screen is on but no sound (blinkers, no microphone, and music)"
Issues are posted on reddit all the time.
"They would have to physically see and attempt to fix the car multiple times without success for the lemon law to even begin to be viable. Having to wait does not count as an attempt. 

Also Canada doesn't have Lemon Laws anyway."
The inability to contact anyone on the phone at the SC is annoying AF.
"Yes, thought about that, but there is no way to put the car in tow mode with the screen off. Won't this damage the car, considering they would have to tow it for 3 and half hours."
"Nonsense. You expect people to show up with pitchforks with you? No one likes a drama queen, these are all horrible problems that are PROBABLY all related to One failure (a computer, a wiring harness, something) and it’ll be resolved at a service appointment. It would probably even be resolved faster if they go in for a walk up appointment.
Reacting in a reasonable manner is not “blind allegiance”
We’re just reacting like reasonable adults to a typical adult situation everyone has had to deal with in their lives."
You’re wrong on every point. Plenty of people have gripes that aren’t downvoted. It’s all about how you do it.
Nobody here has an issue with constructive criticism or true stories about car issues. I don’t know why you’re trying to stir up drama.
These aren't cold related. Cold related would be lowered efficiency and a cold battery
"Other Tesla is babied, it sleeps in the garage in the Winter, it only have theft coverage on it right now. It's my wife's car, she's on leave because we just had a kid, so she doesn't need it for work for a while and we have two other cars. I had a mobile tech come out for the other Tesla earlier on, Window was mis aligned, and they came and repaired it. They were awesome. Service was great, no complaints, but it was a minor issue that didn't effect my everyday driving, so I was more laid back."
"No rodents that I know of, I do have an SSD drive hooked up to the USB. I also have the pad phone charger hooked up to the other USB port. I honestly thought that it could be an issue, but had that drive hooked up since day one. Might have to remove it and see if there is any improvements. Thanks for the advice."
"Tesla service has been horrible. I didn't type the whole backstory, but it actually took 4 days just to make an appointment. Also made me realize that too much depends on the electronics of this car, and if one electrical thing goes wrong it's a snowball effect. Less parts means, when one goes wrong it effects a whole lot of car. Too much depends on that screen and without it, I can't see speed, range, change heat, listen to music. I like that there is a fail safe and I can still drive the car, but I feel like 75% of the car is missing because the screen doesn't turn on."
"It's a 3 and a half hour drive to nearest service centre to take a risk like that, and not have a ride back home. Also just found out what the penthouse reset is. I haven't done it, seems a little dangerous with all the electricity going through that area, but if mobile ranger can't figure it out, I may have to attempt the penthouse reset."
Came here to say exactly this. Based on what I’ve read in other forums either the 12 volt battery is going bad or (maybe also and) the OP needs to remove the thumb drive or whatever storage media is being used and then try a reset/redone load.
"Thought about this, I hate the fact Tesla has a 12 volt battery. Hoping they get rid of this in future cars."
"It SEEMS like they have more problems because every issue gets blown up. But if you look at actual warranty claims data, their claims have been lower than other major manufacturers."
"If I have a lemon and it can't get fixed, might as well try to get Tesla to take it back and trade it in for a Y. Like I said I have 2 Tesla's, one is fine, so trading in a lemon and have them deal with it is an option. Selling a Model Y that works, is easier to sell than a Model 3 that works sometimes. Hard for you to understand, but I'm trying to cut my loses, and I heard Tesla trades in their own cars for a fair bit of money. Excuses? You mean issues and problems with solutions?"
Agree.  No screen means it’s not legally drivable.
Tesla gave up on him? He made an appointment.  If it’s super urgent you can also just bring it in and get a loaner.
If you have a cell phone mount some GPS apps like Waze show mph.

"this is exactly why i bought a volt instead.  5 min drive to service instead of 150min.      


I want a cyber truck but I wont be buying one until they get a service centre closer and deal with the backlogs.  i need my wheels, i cant wait days or weeks for service."
Just match the person in front of you
"I have had some issues that couldn't be resolved with the standard reset and the penthouse reset fixed them. One example is 'car cannot charge'. Either way, this will essentially reboot everything:

https://youtu.be/8BTzPezQfRY

The steering wheel reboot won't work for the most extreme errors and the penthouse reset is required.

It take less than 10 minutes. You disconnect the 12V battery under the hood, pop the rear seat, and disengage/re-engage the switch underneath, then reconnect the 12V. Pretty simple and may be the fix you're looking for."
"It’s your main cpu. They will replace.

As for the service times, geography matters. I would not buy a Tesla if I lived in that climate and remote from service. You are an early adopter and should know the risks. Doesn’t mean your situation is okay, but you are also responsible and not just a victim."
"That's what happens in any environment made for one specific brand.  The viewpoint is that if you are here you want to be here, and if your posting something hateful or even just mildly dis satisfactory you are seen as a hater that just comes to the sub to rile people up.

I mean you can literally down vote shit. This is why there should only be an up-vote ability, if its a topic that is taboo (so to speak) you can't just go ""meh I don't like it get it out of here"" instead you can choose not to up-vote, but then when I come by and see a controversial subject being discussed in detail its ranking can still be elevated."
[deleted]
"Oh, well shoot... Maybe it is hardware then. Service will get you up and running it's just too bad it took so long for your appointment."
"That is insane. They definitely need to work on customer service and service of the cars. I've had no issues yet, thank god, but I know it can always be better."
"If no one has suggested this yet, try calling a Tesla retail store. It’s a little-known fact, but the people working there are pretty much the same tier as the people in service centers, and they do tend to pick up more often (at least in Southern California). They should be able to advise you on what to do at the very least; they have helped me in the past when other avenues failed"
"Oof, sorry to hear that :/ Hopefully the service center fixes the problem for you. At least you'll get a loaner for free until it's done."
And they are downvoted all the time because of worthless fanboys.
And then downvoted into oblivion because we all know that Teslas are high-quality machines with zero defects.
Tesla should be towed on a flatbed. They only tow it about 20 feet onto the trailer. I'd assume this won't do any damage.
"This is THEIR JOB to deal with. Stop taking it upon yourself. If they damage the car, they will need to do further repairs. It's already broken AF so stop worrying and just let them handle it.

Then you can get a loaner."
"I’ve had 2 fuel pumps fail on BMW’s within the first year of ownership. A 2008 135i while I was on the highway and stalled out. Had to wait about 10 days for a replacement and happened again on a brand new 2014 335xi. BMW had no replacements available and had to wait a month for them to replace the fuel pump. 

I did receiver a loaner in the mean time but still went 4-5 weeks without a brand new car that I just purchased. Every manufacturer has problems regardless of the price you pay for the car.  Tesla should definitely offer op a loaner in the mean time but every manufacturer has problems. I would be at a Tesla service center and not leave until they gave me a car, even if they couldn’t look at my car for a few weeks."
"You epitomize the pro-Tesla fanboys that downvote anything negative about Tesla, and attempt to normalize the ridiculous things that owners have to go through.

> these are all horrible problems that are PROBABLY all related to One failure

That doesn't make it better. All that matters here is the end-user experience here.

> it’ll be resolved at a service appointment

Yeah, one that they couldn't schedule for earlier than *20 fucking days* after OP placed the appointment. Despite the car being unsafe to drive they didn't offer a loaner or rental credit or anything.

> would probably even be resolved faster if they go in for a walk up appointment

Which isn't possible because their car is busted. Do you seriously expect them to drive so long with a car in such a sketchy state?

> everyone has had to deal with in their lives

Don't normalize this. Tesla's customer service and repair is some of the worst in the industry, if not *the* worst."
"No, really, it's all about how many of the first people to see your post are Tesla fanboys, versus how many are capable of rational thought.

I have seen plenty of posts about serious, often unique issues at 0."
"Yeah makes sense. I definitely feel like service center should be prioritizing your visit based on the magnitude of the issues. I think realistically Tesla is a little under water in terms of capacity as more and more cars hit the streets. Hopefully they are planning to ramp up infrastructure for parts and service. But I imagine Tesla had been prioritizing car production as that’s the base of their income. Anyways, I hope they get you all fixed up and this is the last issue you have for a long time. Best of luck to you!"
"well have you tested it? Also in regards to getting rid of the 12 volt battery that wont happen because the 12 volt battery allows the car to sleep while maintaining power to all the important equipment like the computers, electronic locks, etc. Without the 12 volt battery to power these devices and act as a buffer for transient loads the car would never be able to sleep and also the catch 22 that the 12 volt battery essentially acts as a backup. If you had no 12 volt battery to power all the computers necessary to manage charging, voltage and everything else if you ran the main battery pack empty then you essentially have a brick. Alot easier to go get a new 12 volt battery and plop in the front then needing a new battery pack."
"> It SEEMS like they have more problems because every issue gets blown up.

The number of problems is less relevant. Every issue gets blown up how shitty Tesla's warranty experience is.

Other manufacturers have smooth warranty processes. Tesla's warranty process is broken as fuck and it takes an unreasonably long amount of time to get anything fixed.

It's at the point where Tesla ought to pay for the amount your car depreciates while it's in for repair."
Is this something each auto manufacturer publishes each quarter?
"And think about the demo of Tesla. We are all likely to be on places like here. So when you see even as many as 100 people complain about the same thing it gets you really concerned. But keep in mind y’all, they are well on their way to 1 million cars.

Now that doesn’t mean that these problems shouldn’t be taken care of. But a few people posting on reddit shouldn’t be seen as the majority of Tesla owners having problems."
Yup. 100% agree.
Like car and driver's test car?  Lol.
"But you haven’t even had the issue addressed.  It might be a one off issue that is fixed and never happens again.  lemons are the same issue that’s persistent even after service. Excuses- several people suggested you drive to the service center to which you replied with excuses.  Someone suggested the penthouse reset, to which you provided an excuse.  You’re a troll."
"Cut your losses? At least give Tesla a chance to fix the damn thing. Do you normally give up on things this easily? 

I'd understand if you'd taken it in multiple times; it's not even been there once."
"Yup. If OP showed up at Tesla service and expressed their frustration, I'm certain Tesla would jump on this."
"Yes. Not sure if this has been discussed elsewhere, but OP needs to take his car in and have a conversation with the service manager and get a loaner. If anyone is this upset they need to let them know and give them a chance to make it right. Tesla should appreciate the opportunity."
This is the right answer. Call them. Demand help.
Being within reasonable range of a service center is a smart idea
That's a model 3 in the video?
"Hopefully they fix it. That's why I'm documenting it. I don't want them to get here, do a reset and say, it works and leave me with the same issue."
"I agree that it's a major component, hopefully they have parts available and don't make him wait for another appointment!

I would disagree about the early adopter and being responsible for the issues - what? That doesn't even make sense."
If they can’t service it in a timely manner they shouldn’t be selling it to people
Yeah that’s bullshit
"I just did a search on penthouse reset. There isn't much on the internet about it besides some guy who made a youtube video, and didn't even show doing it, then has a disclaimer about do it at your own risk and disabled comments. Too many red flags to attempt this."
Can confirm. In my recent accident they used a flatbed (the city police)
"Dragging the car into the flat bed won't hurt the car, just wears the tires a little unevenly for like 10-20 feet, which has no impact in the vehicle (or tires for that matter). Some tow truck drivers have sand that theyll put down in front of the tires to make it easier on the tow truck, that way it slides on the sand like they are little wheels."
"Tesla doesn't own a tow company. Tow company ruins car, Tesla and Tow company point finger at each other, and agree to just put the blame on me. Been screwed too many times to go down that road again. Companies rarely take ownership of fucking shit up. They damage the car it's another thing for people to fix. You need to understand Tesla employees aren't magical unicorns that can fix everything. They are humans, they are only as good as the person who trained them, and it gets all watered down from there. Very rarely do you encounter an ""expert"" that knows the ins and outs of your car. A lot of times they just rely on computers to plug into your car and tell them what's wrong with it. But the issue may be deeper than computers can understand. After working with the public and briefly in the auto industry, I can tell you that the world is full of incompetent people that will not take the blame, and it's rare to find someone who knows what they are doing. Passion and knowledge is lacking. Finally, I had an old corvette at a shop once, guy drove my car into the wall, guess who ended up paying for it? ME. I took it in for a brake job, and he blamed hitting a wall because the brakes weren't working. Well they were working up until I dropped it off. Hence why I have to take precautions and document everything now. People are incompetent. I also ended up taking that shop to court and lost. Love the justice system!"
"Contrary to your assumptions, I didn’t downvote anyone, I’m quite supportive of OPs plight, and think it should be dealt with. Tesla is very clear about service appointments, you will get the same message from them.
1) If it’s drivable and not urgent, set an appointment.
2) If it’s drivable and urgent, do a drop in appointment.
3) If it’s undrivable, call Tesla roadside and get towed to a drop in appointment. 
These are simple solutions, if OP is not driving around their car, then the 3rd option is free and recommend. No hysteria necessary.

You epitomize the drama queen subset of this sub who flies into a rage every time someone doesn’t agree that the solution to a service appointment wasn’t to burn the fucking service center to the ground. I’m not certain you’ve ever even owned a car before."
"It’s really about whether the criticisms are constructive and well-founded, and novel enough that it doesn’t feel just like repeating the same old thing. I saw several critical posts from the last week with 30 and more upvotes. But if you come in whining and exaggerating, you’re not going to get a good reception here. Just like if you go into a Mustang subreddit in order to start a bitchfest, it’s probably not going to go well for you. 

There are diehard fans of many vehicles and companies.  Yes, there are more for Tesla than almost any other. There are also more haters of Tesla, and those of us who try to be reasonable supporters of the mission and enjoy the products also get tired of the hate machine."
"Hyundai has already eliminated the 12v battery on the Ioniq/Niro. It can be done, it just requires extra hardware on the main battery."
"I've never had another auto manufacturer send a tech out to my house or work to fix my car. 

I have however had to drop my ice vehicle off at a dealership and be without it for days without getting a loaner."
"https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a25574981/2018-range-rover-velar-reliability-maintenance-20k-update/

Their Range Rover had to be towed too, but I dont remember that getting blown up on the news too."
"BTW, I just googled penthouse reset and there is no information on it. Sounds like a pretty dumb idea to go and play with the high voltage cables when there is barely any information about it on the net."
"Have you ever done a penthouse reset? Please, go ahead and play with all that voltage, be my guest. I never heard of it until now, I said I would try it if all else fails, but I'll have to do a ton of research before attempting it. 
I'm not driving 3 and half hours to a service centre with no screen to be potentially rejected. I don't have that kind of time. I don't know if you understand but 3 and half hours means 7 hours on the road plus time in the Tesla service centre, that's at the very least 8 hours of my day if all goes well. I guess wasting minimum 8 hours of my day is trolling, taking time off work and abandoning my young family, for rolling the dice on Tesla even listening to me. I went to Tesla once for a test drive and they turned me down. They literally had 6 people standing around doing nothing and a ton of cars to test drive. Sorry bro, Tesla is flawless and I guess I'm a troll."
"Yes, wish I lived near a Tesla service centre. Nearest one is 3 and half hour drive...with no traffic."
"Use the roadside assistance on the App. They'll let you know if there will be any cost to you for towing. Mines was a different issue but the tow was only 45mins so not sure how that would work if its a 3hr tow, but worth a try."
"Yes. The YouTube video description begins with Model 3. I can see where the confusion would come from though as that appears to be the European CCS charging port on a Model 3. However, I expect the other internals, like the penthouse, to be the same as the North American model."
"Simple. 

New products. New issues/bugs.

Same thing for an astronaut- you know you’re going to the cutting edge of technology, it’s cuts both ways."
It’s the holidays... Everyone is in the same boat.
Just outright refuse? How about a warning.
"Well, IMO, you shouldn’t be driving the car, so you really only have the option of getting the company to either come out and repair it on site or letting them tow it.  Like you said, document everything (photos of all sides of car to show no body damage etc.) and then go with the “best” option Tesla provides you with."
Well regardless the Tesla has one and he never responded about if he checked it or not
Have you tried calling them and asking for the service manager to express your frustrations? I would tell them I'm in my way and I'll need a loaner given the circumstances. Tesla should appreciate the opportunity to do right by you.
"Something you should have thought about buying multiple Teslas?

I just don't understand how you couldn't foresee something like this occurring. This isn't a car you or your buddy can repair, don't buy it if the nearest SC is hours away."
"I often say that it drives like a spaceship but I think buying an electric car is nothing like being an astronaut. Kind of sad, if this happened to a Volt everyone would be blaming the manufacturer."
"Where I work, we take extra care with our early adopters. We know that they are going to hit issues that we haven’t seen in internal testing and so we want to be able to address their issues quickly so our future customers won’t hit the same issues and will have a better experience. I think it is victim blaming to say the early adopter should expect this. They forked out the cash for a working car! They should expect extra care and handling of anything.

I would hope that Tesla has a diagnostic that can detect CPU or other hardware failures and get this resolved. This kind of thing potentially affects all of us."
"> New products. New issues/bugs.

Yep. We're not just on the cutting edge of new technology here - we're on the bleeding edge. We enjoy thinking of ourselves as being ahead of the pack, but it's called the bleeding edge for a reason. If I wanted something that just always worked, I'd still be driving my 22 year old GMC pickup."
True.
"Have you ever tried calling Tesla? You will never get to a human.

Unless Elon decides to be in a charitable mood on Twitter, the service is not going to be fixed."
"Okay a bit of a lope-sided analogy. 

Really simple, Buyer be aware."
"The car is designed for Northern California. Period. Other climates and regions for the most part don’t support them well. Sure LR helps but it’s hardly a replacement outside urban core.

Adding in the service strategy and not having a SC to go to, I wouldn’t have it be my primary car and even living in NorCal I keep my 4Runner because it lasts forever and I can take it apart 99% in my garage."
Yes. I call the Service Center direct. I get a human. Don't call their corporate numbers.
Ive called their 800 number multiple times. They were always very helpful.
"Well, I'm in the mid-Atlantic, so I guess I'm screwed. And yes, I could take that Sonoma apart and put it back together no problem, but I've been doing that stuff since the 60's - my father had an austin-healy bug-eye sprite, and I remember pulling parts for it at a junkyard - but that kind of thing got really old a long time ago. 

I'd rather be on the bleeding edge instead of going back to the days of carrying extra fanbelts and big old screwdrivers in the trunk, and I suspect most folks here feel the same way."
"I feel that way! It will be that way everywhere, but it isn’t everywhere yet. Stock price will depend on them expanding service centers and mobile teams I think."
Where's the second row seats?  Sure the third row folds down but second row looks to just adjust forward and back.  Not fold?
"We’re on our road trip from FL to WA to MN and back to FL in  Model X 6 seater. Because we’re in our 70s we practice social distancing and avoid hotels when possible. Three suitcases are btw the second row seats and first and second row, covered by an air mattress. I am 6;3 and can stretch out completely. My wife reclines the passenger seat completely and puts a foam mattress on it for softness. Works fine and with the romance mode we have it cosy. With air on we’re losing 15 miles over night."
I have a 7 seater and my 2nd row folds down as well as the 3rd row.  No idea what X they have though.
Newer (around 2017/2018 I believe) 7 seaters were changed to non-electric and foldable. The 6 seater captain’s seats are great for kids or dogs but we opted for foldable 7 seater to have the flat surface! Otherwise we would’ve gotten the 5 seater.
15 miles is 24.14 km
"When we had our Model X, it was the key fob in a coat or pants pocket in range of the vehicle. My husband once was on the  ground petting and rough housing with a dog and a couple of doors were open when we went out to the car. 

I took the X camping and the way I sat in the camp chair with the coat inside my pocket was enough to pop open the door or a trunk (we were cold weather camping and my jacket was right due to all the other layers I had on underneath it."
Yeah I am not sure how mine happened. But my left Falcon door was wide open. Thankfully we came back an hour later but this was a high traffic mall! Nothing was stolen
Never happened to me. Disable passive entry and Set to triple click.
"Actually had it happen just a few days ago. Checked our cameras and it happened right before I walked outside (front door is the only part of the interior within range). It must have been when I leaned over to out my shoes on.

When we go camping I actually wrap the key in aluminum foil because we are usually close enough to the car that it constantly locks and unlocks."

"I have a 2016X with winter tire. When I go too fast and start skidding, it behave like all the other AWD (audi and subaru) I had. Since all wheels are powered and pushing same speed, when we loose traction, it’s on all wheels mostly. I prefer it that way now... it is a “slower” lost of control easier to manage"
"Chill mode and regen to low in slippery conditions.

And if you are going to be driving in icy/snowy conditions definitely wear snow shoes! Most all seasons are pitiful against ice. Snowies have softer compound and sipes to give you a chance at gripping the ice.

Edit: And definitely adjust speeds down and consider that weight going into corners!"
"Drop regen to low. I know it sucks because we want that extra range in winter, but I found in my 3 it kicked out the back end and could cause a spin due to it being far heavier regen (maybe all?)  on the rear axle."
"Yea pretty much. Just like in normal driving. And yes, it could be a problem, much like panic braking in a normal car would be. 


But where it gets different than what you did is steering. With AWD cars you don't want to turn into the slide like you do a 2wd vehicle. You'll spin worse if you do. What you essentially do is keep the wheel straight and lightly power thru. It'll pull the car thru the turn."
Wow. This is amazing. I am getting more convinced to get the Model Y now. Enough of the gas guzzling 14mpg Acura SUV polluting the planet
"In order to get that range, I took another look at my res and downgraded my Performance model by removing the  ""Performance Upgrade"".  Prefer the smaller wheels anyways and don't need or want lowered suspension or higher top speed."
21mpg Macan is going bye-bye hopefully very soon.
"0-60 in less than 5 seconds is way more speed than anyone will ever need...the average driver had never experienced 0-60 in less than 8 seconds most likely. 

Whether you want it or not is a different question 👹"
"That is a beautiful car though. I can’t wait to check out the model Y, but I am curious as to how much luxury I will lose in the interior."
Yep. Fast.
-3.2875 standard luxury units
"Haha good post. Interior is huge for me personally. I currently have heated/cooled seats, heated steering wheel, massage seats (never knew I wanted that). Those are really nice interior features that will be hard to lose."
So excited
I really hope the powered rear seat is a thing!! That makes me want it even more!
I have a feeling this is going to me mechanical. The tweet says “auto folding... kinda power folding”.
"Hard to say, all I’ve heard about them it sounds like they are powered."
