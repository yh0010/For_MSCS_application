This is probably exactly the positive attitude that Elon was aiming for. Nice.
It's happening you guys
"As much as I love Tesla and hope to own a Model S one day, I would absolutely love a Volvo EV. Their craftsmanship is outstanding. "
"#[Source article \(Reuters\).](http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-volvocars-diesel-idUKKCN18D0NF)

> From today's perspective, we will not develop any more new generation diesel engines.  
>...Instead, Volvo will invest in the electric and hybrid cars, with its first pure electric model due on the market in 2019.

They later noted this huge change was ""discussing options"" instead of a firm plan, but I'd like to think the CEO said it just a bit earlier than Volvo's PR team felt ready to admit it.

If this isn't a watershed moment, I don't know what is.
"
I've been saying this a while. That pictured Volvo XC40.1 concept car is damn sexy. 
"I'm wondering if this applies to their truck division as well. If true, this would be big as a quick google search shows they have a 15% share on the big rig market. That's a huuuge disruption"
[deleted]
"I don't really want to cause trouble here, and I don't know how this will go over, but why is no one seemingly working on a diesel electric hybrid? A small Diesel engine tuned to run at a constant rpm to run a generator can be made extremely efficient. I don't understand why all hybrids seem to be running gas engines, and typically use the gas engine to power the wheels when the battery's go flat. Locomotives operate on diesel electric hybrid power and are incredibly efficient at moving freight by weight per fuel consumption. "
"A Volvo EV would be killer. Have you guys seen their latest design language and interior? Heated, Cooled and massaging front seats! WTF!? So sleek, modern, minimalistic. "
"I like Volvo's (comparatively) bold attitude of late. I applauded their (widely unpopular) decision to focus on 4-cylinders and, naturally, I applaud their electrification efforts. They also developed one of the best infotainment UIs on the market for the latest S90, V90 and XC90 vehicles.

Go Volvo! :)"
"So instead of making gas engines and diesel engines, they'll make gas engines and electric motors? That's pretty cool. I wonder when they'll stop making gas engine cars altogether?"

"While this is good news, I'm also not impressed. I think the reason they are doing this is because of the VW diesel scandal has resulted in slow diesel sales and they see what Tesla is able to do meaning a lot of the risk has been removed for them. Pretty much all manufacturers will do this and most are already planning to. It's a bit late for me to be impressed by this move, it's obvious now."
A source told me Mercedes is doing the same thing with their research and development team.
Is this good? Volvo has amazing small diesels that get 50+ mpg if they said gas engines I'd be impressed. 
Demand was there all along. Before Musk nobody made electric cars worth driving. I'm glad Musk showed those greedy companies that there is money being made from electric cars.
I credit VW for proving that you can no longer make affordable diesel passenger vehicles that will pass emissions in the US.
"I really hope this doesn't become the thought process for every manufacturer. Don't get me wrong, I love the technology - it is why I'm in this sub. That said, EV's  aren't for everyone. Even if a EV was in my budget, it could not be my only vehicle. I would need to make too many lifestyle changes to stick to have an EV be my only vehicle."
Gm is doing it.  Why not Ford or toyota? 
"I wish Volvo had completely followed through with their last EV, the electric C30. It didn't have the range to be really practical outside the city. I'm certainly biased, as a C30 owner, but if they brought a ~200mi range S40 (C30/V50) class car to the market, it would be a killer product. "

Nice! I bet their stock will triple in value in 2-3 years if they can penetrate EV market. 
"Thanks, Elon."
Awesome.  Feels like with world is barely holding together sometimes but days like these make me happy
That is one of the nicest looking Volvo's I've ever seen. 
What about their stripper edition cars?
lol power marketing move
Volvo supercharger partner?
"Probably because Volvo is cheating emissions standards, a la VW"
And the race begins.
I'd totally buy an electric car!....if I could afford one.
"""Again, Volvo’s first all-vehicle""


Hey /u/fredtesla I think that's missing a word "
...in 2020 (running joke in the Tesla community).
I think Volvo is transforming into the Tesla of Europe. It has the ability to give you what Tesla has with better exterior/interior design and safety. Not sure about power and batteries for now lol.....
"Good news, but it does annoy me that car manufacturers that have been around for decades are only now starting to make truly compelling EV's."
"I remember when the car industry was dismissive of Tesla and expected them to fail, how wrong they were. The car industry is now looking at Tesla and adjusting their business models to include EV in future production. It can no longer be ignored by the rest of the industry."
Excellent. Currently driving a 2016 V40 on a contract which ends in early 2021. If there's an all-electric Volvo available to buy when the time comes I'll be a happy bunny.
"I find it really stupid how car companies took this long to switch over to electric cars when we clearly had the technology +20 years ago.  The demand WAS there, its just that these companies were more concerned with keeping good relations with the oil companies. "
Also probably because diesel emission control is becoming stricter and stricter in the EU

"What's the maintenance cost/longevity of an EV? Diesels last. Hundreds of thousands of miles when serviced correctly. Can the same be said for EV? Don't get me wrong, I get it, I know we need FF alternatives. I'm just not sure we're at a point where diesels can be replaced by them. "
"Ah, excellent. What a time to be alive!"
"TIL, Volvo is still in business. "
"As a loyal Volvo driver (and Tesla enthusiast) this makes me really happy. 

Please bring an EV V40 stateside. :)"
"Awesome choice by Volvo.

The more the merrier and better choices and options the buyers will have."
"fan bois?  good lord....  suck a dank....  :)

p.s. I'm all for EV's, but not on a fake business model...."
This was to be expected. Whether or not Tesla new it they created a huge disruptive innovation. By nature they work within a small section of the market with limited technology with little threat to other companies. This ventually ripples down and disrupts the rest of the market. This puts huge pressure of competitors to adopt similar innovations and technology.
Elon must be so happy about this news.
"Tesla is the apple of EV.  
Great at marketing but shit at delivering "
Volvo should focus on designing a better looking boot/trunk first so people will actually want their cars.
"This is great for electric,  but a bummer for deisel.  I like both,  gas cars are the worst..."
Thank you president Musk
"I want to know what happened to their Volvo recharge. I was excited to see that concept be made someplace.  The military RSV-T had crazy good performance over a Humvee with the similar concept.  Large boats, and trains use the concept."
40k wtf
I'm sure it also has something to do with how hard it is getting to make diesels pass new passenger vehicle emission standards. VW and others have all been recently caught cheating diesel emission tests.
"They should probably focus on making cars that aren't absolute shit. Maybe team up with VW, make it a joint venture "
"This isn't really due to Tesla. They had planned to move out of diesel from 2020-2025 anyway, and if I remember correctly only in cars. Trucks is a separate business.
The research centre that they are the primary funders for, and which does most of the related diesel research had already moved out of this area.

Good PR to put it up to Tesla though!"

"""after 2023"" wow that seems like ages from now, imagine where Tesla might be at this time. Frankly, I don't see it as that big of a deal, if your not making EVs ""after 2023"" your probably not making cars..."

Volvo is the new Audi. They're top of the game interior wise now. First sensible automotive comment I think I've ever seen on this sub. 
"2019, compact model, already confirmed as first Volvo EV."
If Audi would come out with an ev I would buy it in a second I don't know why it's taken so long for other car companies to make ev that don't look like shit. Batteries must be crazy expensive.
"We had a Volvo V50, and it was one of the greatest cars to drive, and the build quality was great, until the transmission starting playing up and caused tremendous problems for the car which apparently was a common problem for Volvo."
[deleted]
Could be checking public reaction before committing.
"Here's more images of the concept

http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1103940_volvo-concepts-preview-new-s40-and-xc40-compact-cars"
I agree. Best looking Volvo I've seen in a while. 
Except for those directional wheels. Why does everyone think EVs need directional wheels!?!
"My midnight blue XC90 from 2010 is still the prettiest on the road wherever I drive. 7 years later. 

It is amazing how good the design language was ahead of its time. Compared to the Honda CRV...that thing has such an ugly ass end! "
The new front they are going with in the new line up is gorgeous.
"Their SUV line have been so attractive lately. If I had money I would take the Volvo over the Mercedes, BMW and Porsche "
You've been says ng that Volvo will stop developing diesel engines?
"They don't have a truck division. Volvo cars and Volvo trucks are two separate companies with different owners, since Ford bought Volvo's car division in 1999. Volvo cars are now owned by Geely, a Chinese company.

Volvo trucks have a [hybrid concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV-54LlSbcw), but as far as I know there are no immediate plans for fully electric trucks."
"Stop developing new. Not stop building. 

I imagine they can continue to sell the same diesel engines for a few decades at least, with no loss of revenue due to not designing new ones. "
I highly doubt it.
I think the design of the Superchargers has been open-sourced and may be used by any manufacturer.
Since Volvo is Scandinavian they'll more likely go with the 350kw Combo2 plug.. 
A lot of it might have to do with the fact diesel cars aren't a big thing in the US. And I agree with you that it should be more of a thing.
I think VW just poisoned the diesel well forever.
[deleted]
You mean like BMW i3 REX?
"In Austria you get a 3000 € rebate if you buy a Plug in car. Except if it is a disel plug in. Why? ""Because their image took a hit latly"" - real words (just in german)"
"Hybrid gas engines tend to start and stop a lot, isn't diesel inefficient in that scenario?"
"I'd venture weight. If you already have the penalty of dragging around an gas ICE (or battery, depending on your perspective) why would you want to make part of the equation even heavier? Plus electric motors supply the torque that the diesel would normally give. And the motor can smooth out the peakiness in high-boost turbos (aka i8, P1, 918)"
"Volvo had a diesel hybrid for v60, but its limited to Europe only."
"Converting energy from diesel to rotation to electric to rotation does not really make sense in a small enclosure of a car. You have losses everywhere and you would need an diesel generator, an alternator and an electric motor (so basically 3 engines in your car).

I'm not saying that it can't be done, but today it is not as efficient as using a ICE in a more classical way supplemented with an electric engine that can be both used to recover energy or power the car."
I think BMW did similar things to this with the i3 that has a gasoline range extender/generator and the i8 with a diesel hybrid drivetrain.
"To be fair, the Lincoln Continental has those. "
That's one way to decrease your EV mileage 
When they stop being profitable :)
Diesels have been getting a bad rep. It's a reasonable bet for a company to make that improving diesels may not be worth putting resources into.
When someone magically solves the lithium supply problem.
I think they meant they would stop improving their diesel engines. I imagine phasing them out of production entirely will follow the revenue.
"They don't make their own diesels anyway.  They share Ford diesels.

This means nothing."
When people stop buying them. 
I'll give them credit when they put their money where their mouth is. In a few years if they follow through then I'll be impressed.
Makes me want to buy a Tesla :) Reward the company that was brave enough to lead... not the one who is brave enough to follow when the weather is clear.
"Slow diesel sales where?  The US?  Europe could care less about that.  I could see them stopping petrol car sales before stopping diesel sales.   A quick Google shows that more than half of cars currently sold in Europe are diesel.  I can't imagine it's even 10% stateside.   Sure, there might be a dip in sales, but half of all sales is still half of all sales.  "
Although what VW did was terrible the outcome will be good for the earth and fastracking EVs to market is better for us conscious consumers. Even if Volvo is following VW its a win win situation for the environment.
"I was so pissed about that scandal. That story dropped 3 months after bought my TDI, and even though my car wasn't part of it, the value still plummeted. "
doesn't matter. it's happening
I think it's more likely that manufacturers are fed up with trying to meet regulations on their diesels.  VW cheated for this reason and is all but withdrawing from selling diesels going forward.  It isn't worth the hassle of re-engineering to meet national and international emissions standards so they're pivoting to a market with growing options and a good outlook. 
"They're just getting in the game early because they realize they have to eventually.

Being one of the first helps sales"
">there is money being made from electric cars.

well... I wouldn't go that far"
"Why couldn't a long range, fast charging EV be your only vehicle?"
There are still so many problems with EVs and some use cases at the moment. I'd love to buy one but until it's as good or better at EVERYTHING I can't see it happening
"I'm super disappointed in Toyota. They come out with the Prius and just stop there. And then come out with the Prius Prime, advertise it as a plug-in and it's still just a hybrid? I was expecting them to be the first to market with a long-range EV given their hybrid history, but nothing, not even upcoming."
"You can say the same about any other car at that price. If BMW had an electric 3 series, or Audi an A4, they would all be great cars. But nope. Had to be a brand new company to take all the risk and create a market."
that's volkswagen
"I'm pretty sure everyone here wants electric, and everyone else wants gas. Nobody wants a diesel hybrid."
"They have the V60 PHEV and it has phenomenal mileage. 

Europe only."
"There are leaf taxis that have done 150,000 miles with minimal maintenance.

An EV has fewer moving parts.. servicing one is often just topping up the screen wash.  No reason why they shouldn't last a while."
Except Apple makes a ton of money
Pretty sure Volvo cars (not their commercial stuff) is owned by a Chinese company.

Not really fair to compare a brand spanking new EV to a car that went out of production some 25 years ago :)

"I agree. When I was looking for a new car, I went across town to see an Audi A4. 10 Reg, sat nav, nice interior, until I got in it. It was so cramped... for a saloon car! I couldn't believe it, it was really uncomfortable. Then on the way out I noticed they had a V40, 12 reg with the sat nav etc. Took it for a test drive and bought it on the spot. I love it, the interior is great, the seats are really excellent and the drive is fantastic!"
"But Volvo is married to their turbo four-cylinder engines. In the market the S90 is competing, you need more performance than that. Perhaps going EV will help."
The i3 offends me.
"Audi e-tron with 300 miles of range will be available pretty soon, no idea why people are so silent about it."
"> Edit: weird apparently everyone here are mao loyalists and also have forgotten Volvo's TDI scandal crap

Did you mean *Volkswagen*, perhaps?"
"Ahaha, so original. /s"
"You mean like iPhones are? In general, I think it's best not to underestimate the Chinese. Western manufacturers used to speak this way about the Japanese accusing them of making poor quality ripoffs. There was some truth in it initially, but the Japanese kept plugging away and in only a few decades dominated the very people that looked down on them. I think China is following a similar trajectory. 

"
"First of all, VW was the TDI scandal. Secondly, I downvoted you for making a frankly stale comment regarding the value of commodities exiting China."
Volvo ≠ Volkswagen dumbass
"Chinese manufacturing can be good, problem is product developers here say ""we want you to make this at this price point"" and rather than telling their customer ""can't be done"" they find a way to do it by cutting corners to hit the price that was requested. So the problem is more cultural/failed communication rather than All Chinese manufacturing sucks. "
China makes almost everything. Nice shit as well as cheap shit. 
"China has come a long way in the last 5 years.

Also, you need to google who made the TDI engines."
"You're working off of outdated news.  Fact is, if you buy cheap junk, then you will get cheap junk, regardless of the country of origin.  If you pay for a premium product, you will usually get a premium product.  China has come a long way in manufacturing prowess, and it'd be unwise to underestimate them."
"Kind of like something else I know, all I want is to see the interior. "
"Ew, what is that black thing on the front end!?"
Some interesting lines on that vehicle.
Why are they aping nissan design? A a stupid black slash on the c pillar and it's an altima. 
"I feel this design language is emerging now. Edges like the Evoque and the lower area design on the doors is similar to the Faraday Future coming. I guess it's to make the car look slimmer or something. 

But it's just my first impressions. 

"
"I actually think this is an ICE concept. 🤔

And I love the wheels 🤷🏽‍♂️"
"Volvo's age very well. They may not look ""hot"", but they won't look bad ever either."
Agreed!
"Correct. The original Volvo company (that makes the trucks) is still traded on the Stockholm Stock Exchange, while the car spin-off is owned by Geely."
"The article said they hinted at stopping production in 2023 so about 6 years. But again, I doubt that refers to semi trucks. They don't even have the battery production capacity for a sedan, let alone a semi which would take 10x the batteries."
"It is very likely that emmision rules will keep getting sharpened. That means that without development, cars that previously fell within regulations, afterwards don't. How long it will take, I do not know, but I find several decades to be a very high number."
Where have you heard of this? Sources?
"The scandal goes beyond VW, you know? They were just the first ones to be caught with their hands in the cookie jar. Perhaps because they are the largest manufacturer of Diesels, but any of the other companies caught could just as well have been the first."
"I think with the size you'd be able to use, and if it were tuned to run at its most efficient RPM and maintain it to run a generator, I would imagine you could tune the emissions to a minimum. "
That's pretty brilliant reasoning. 
"Diesel electrics typically wouldn't have the diesel connected to the drive train, instead it acts as a generator and never leaves an idle speed, something that diesels do extremely well. "
"Plus, the continental has these bossy suicide doors..."
That's a convenience and luxury I'd enjoy. I'm not traveling more than 200 or even 300 miles daily anyway ☺️
that and the fact that the competition was harsh enough to make it so that an entire industry turned to cheating the tests to remain competitive. Sorta like the Tour de France.
Lithium supply isn't the problem.
"The bigger the market, the greater the profit, the larger the incentive is to solve the problem ;)"
Lithium is not rare. It's all throughout the earth's crust and in every inch of sea water. A couple thousand tons makes a couple million cars worth of batteries. There are over 40 million tons of known lithium resources in the world already.
Hopefully that happens before the gas problem gets worse. 
lol what
"Those are both ridiculously sappy reasons. You should buy a car for its features, reliability, and price point, not because of some arbitrary distinction that they're a leader or a follower. "
"Europe is exactly the issue. The US is only 3% Diesel. Diesel share in Europe is declining which is what prompted this.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/bertelschmitt/2016/10/13/in-europe-diesel-falls-slowly-out-of-favor/#528ea4418e82"
"I agree, definitely good news however they get to it. Just don't think Volvo deserves any praise for a move which is now obvious and relatively risk free. Had they done this two years ago, I would give them a lot more credit."
"How were you not a part of the replacement offer? They gave people an option to trade in their TDI for a new VW and get cash on top of it, or keep the car and get even more cash... like up to 15k."
"Because they take too long to charge and while I tend to follow a routine, the limited range can limit spontaneous trips. Recharge times add too much time to trips when the goal is to put as many miles on in a day as possible. 600 miles in a day takes long enough without having to deal with recharging. "
Can it tow?
"Mr Toyoda is heading the EV program, trying to fast-track it.

However, this is because China is forcing them to, and now there's India as well."
You seem to be forgetting their hydrogen cars.
"I mean, I agree with you about Tesla opening the market. What I'm saying is, I'm sad that Volvo abaonxed their small car platform for EV development. I'm never going to be an S90 owner. Not because I could ""Never Afford One"", but because I love a small car. I'm not commenting on the price point of this series, but about the form factor."
Woops. Got my V's mixed up

And tesla is a charity that gives money?
"Management is still based in Sweden. 

Like a lot of Chinese acquisitions, the Chinese owners are largely content to let western owners continue to run things as long as they're profitable and bringing cars to market in China profitably. 

Source: My former company was acquired by a Chinese company. We did A LOT of research on this."
They are. They just provide money and Volvo makes cars for China in China. They are opening a plant in America for the same purpose. To avoid taxes and let people buy cars built by their peers. 
"They are, but it's the best kind off ownership, Geely puts in the investment and takes the profits, but nothing else, Volvo is still (within reason) in full control"
"Yup.

Not Ford? 
"Which is true, but Volvo could use some of this shit. The Volvo S90 was just recently measured to emit 1076mg NOx per kilometer, the allowed maximum for emission class Euro 6 cars (all new cars in Europe have to be produced to that standard) is 80mg NOx per kilometer.
Emitting over 1000mg per kilometer exceeds even the Euro 1 emission class, mandatory for all new vehicles from 1993 to 1997.
Clean Diesels are possible, but not attractive, low PM and NOx count require expensive technology, and will use quite a bit of AdBlue additive, which is not attractive for customers. Good thing Volvo is jumping off the Diesel train."
"Audi too, and their gas engines too, not just diesel."

Could be worse. You could've watched SpaceX launch a resupply mission to ISS and the Tesla Supercharger network announcement and then invested all your money in Tesla over the course of months from September 2012 to March 2013. Even though all news reports were poking FUD at Tesla and misunderstanding what a production S curve looks like and why a supercharger network is the critical link. Then spouted off like a dumbass to anyone that would listen about why we were in the birth pangs of a new era.
"My parents had a 1964 1/2 Mustang 289, I'm guessing the Model 3 could rival it, as far as being a milestone in automotive history."
"Yes, you were scammed. Please deposit whatever into EMusks bank account, perhaps you could use PayPal."
I told you so.
"Not him, but in 2012 Elon said that by the late 2020s, more than half of all new vehicles being manufactured will be electric.  [source: green car reports - June 2012](http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1077216_tesla-ceo-elon-musk-half-of-new-cars-will-be-electric-in-15-20-years)

At the time it seemed totally crazy.  I am a believer, but even I had doubts.  Now it seems like it may happen even sooner."
"In for an iM3.

Seriously though, hopefully this is the start of more electric cars that don't suck. the S is awesome, but the Bolt, Leaf, i3, e500 etc are all the same, bubbly, depressing conveyances that turn driving from a pleasurable act to a grinding chore. 

Every car company has proven making a vehicle that runs on electricity is easy. Now I want to see someone other than just Tesla make it FUN. because between a bolt and risking my life commuting by motorcycle, I'm taking the bike.
"
That's something I didn't know. Thanks for bringing it up!
Chevy Bolt is more of a compliance car than a real commitment to electric vehicles though. 
Or the Nissan LEAF?
Bolt or Volt?
"Yes, LG is doing a great job."
Chevy still makes the Cruze diesel.
"they tend to still have interior fans with motors though, which still have to be replaced sometimes, which are still usually a huge pain in your ass if you happen to have to fix one. Ever heard of anyone doing independent mechanical work on a tesla?"
"as far as working on them, EVs are *way* more dangerous. I can see the headlines of the future filled with ""*another weekend mechanic dies because electrical engineering isn't the same as mechanical engineering*"". It only takes a mA of current to kill you. Tasers use microamps of current and those kill people with slight heart conditions that doctors don't even catch. 

Edit: People be stupid

>a much lower current of less than 1 mA (AC or DC) can cause fibrillation [*heart attack*]"
"But what parts they have are a helluva lot more complicated. Any idiot can understand a valve, less so a circuit board. "
"What? EV is just the method propulsion, you still need thermal management (i.e. fluids) for motors and battery packs, on top of the A/C system also requiring plenty of pneumatics. On top of that powertrains are still the same and last I checked transmissions, differntials, clutches, etc are all moving parts. Toss in plenty of HV cables and youre not exactly looking at a simple system."
"Agreed. I'm only here because I used to own a 944turbo, 945turbo and a S70 T5. The 900 series are glorified 200 series and the only things I couldn't replace were things that needed special tools to be done correctly. T20 and T25 bits to remove pretty much everything inside. "

"My god man I feel you there. Myu AWD S60 is a beast in the snow (Denver). On the flip side it's an '02 which is hitting the major issues now at 116k miles. Already had to do the PCV system clean, replace cracked oil trap, leaking cam seals, timing belt, and now the turbo seals are going and blowing oil through the engine on top of the cat being clogged. I could by a small continent for what the parts cost!"

Makes sense. Teslas interiors were horrible despite the denial witnessed here. Hopefully they get on track. 
"See the thing is engine size has nothing to do with performance.

If your engine gets 400 who and 400 lb ft of torque at the same RPM band as a 6 cylinder...is there any difference in performance?

One could even say the 4 banger weighs less."
"I don't think Japan was ever really looked upon how China is today. Japan was a massive industrial power in the early 20th century taking over much of Asia in large part to their manufacturing prowess. Western nations respected them immensely in those years for what they accomplished. And in the post war era it was borderline miraculous how quickly they rebuilt bombed out factories with new state of the art equipment. Shoddy knock off quality work was never much of a criticism for Japan, if anything their rise was marked by fears related to just how high quality products were."
Kind of.  I go to china regularly for work and if you have never been there it's tough to describe.  I would buy a China built car so long westerners we're designing and doing the quality control. It would be tough to convince me to buy a China designed car.  I rode in a byd Tang recently it had like 500 hybrid horsepower it was pretty sick but would probably break down way to fast.  The Chinese are excellent at copying other people ideas but not coming up with their own.  Japanese are great innovators.  They are actually very different.

"pesky oxygen reactions with lithium is the problem.

damn oxygen"
"The current supply of lithium does not come close to covering an electric car future and opening new mines takes at least a decade. 

Also there isn't enough lithium ore out there. "
isn't lithium also in a huge amount of the plants around the world? 
"Sappy? Aside from the fact that Volvo doesn't even have an EV, when they do come out with it, I doubt it'll be better than the Model 3.

That said, even if it was somehow a bit better, I'd still support Tesla because they only make EVs. Voting with your money isn't 'sappy' it's the responsible thing to do.

On features, reliability, and price alone... nobody would buy a Model S or X. The only reason this company exists is because of 'sappy' buyers."
"You had to go through their website and enter your VIN, and I was told I wasn't eligible for the offer. It was only for certain year models if I remember correctly. "
It's completely possible in the future that charging your vehicle to 80% will take roughly as much time as filling up a car with gas. We are nowhere near the limit of energy transfer.
"In 5 years you'll have 300mi EV with a 15 minute to 80% charge, that should do it."
"How many people regularly drive 600 miles (or even 60 miles) in a day though?

I could see EVs taking longer to catch on in rural areas, but for urban areas, other than a lack of charging stations (which is being worked on), I can see usage picking up faster in coming years, especially if the average price drops to rates similar to current production gas-driven cars, which will happen as more companies start to manufacture EVs."
"600 miles must take you two refills in a gas vehicle. One in the middle and one at the beginning or end, right? Imagine an EV with an actual range of 400 miles that takes 20 minutes to recharge and you've just about got parity. Add another ten years and you'll have affordable.

I had a lot of range anxiety before we bought our Tesla. After two years of ownership, none. We even forget to plug it in at night a couple times a month, but it's not a big deal, even at 80% it has enough for 2-3 days of our daily driving. On road trips, I'm usually getting notified that the supercharging is done while walking *toward* the bathroom--I've never had to wait.

I suspect your concerns will be resolved by time. Gas powered vehicles settled in on 300-400 mile range to meet market demand. They could go further, but at eight pounds per gallon, the weight wasn't necessary. Batteries will get to a similar point in time."
"I was really hoping Prius Prime was going to be that, early ads seemed to hint at it, and then it comes out as a 25mi hybrid. Sadness."
Far as I know they only have the Mirai and that's just a pilot program. There is no infrastructure for hydrogen so that's not looking too promising.
"It sucks they abandoned it but I would think that's coming back with this announcement, that would make sense since they already have it developed."
"Those points were valid maybe 5, 10 years ago. You should re-evaluate the range of electric, and the cost vs efficiency of gas and diesel. Not so much anymore."
How interesting! Thank you. 
"This is true, used to work for Volvo."

i3 was one of the most fun cars I tried in my life.
There are electric motorcycles too.
"The LEAF is a pretty fun drive, the 500e and I3 even more so."
"By volume yes, but it would have met compliance requirements at 100mi range, 200mi was done to prepare GM for the future and be first to market with an affordable long-range electric. Sill a worthy investment in my opinion. The compliance part will go away real quick when sales drop due to people buying EVs."
"How so?  Genuinely curious, is it because it allows Chevy to have stuff like their trucks, Corvette and Camaro and still meet their fleet mpg requirements?  The Bolt appears to be a great electric vehicle though and that should be all that counts imo, regardless of why they are making it.    "
">Chevy Bolt is more of a compliance car 

Still selling more than the X was this time last year..."
"I used to say that but I had to eat crow when I saw one is on a dealer lot here in Knoxville, TN far away from the EV hotspots."
Yet I've seen way more Bolts on the road in New England than Model 3s. 
"True, there is also the 500e, e-Golf, Spark EV, Focus EV, etc.. but those are all < 200mi range which is basically a city-car. The Bolt is really the only affordable ICE replacement option for the next couple of months at least."
Bolt. Volt is a hybrid.
"True, it's more like the LG Bolt with how much of it is their design."
And?
"And volvo will probably still *make* diesel vehicles, but they will stop further research into them to focus on electric. I'd imagine at least for the next few years you will still be able to buy a new diesel volvo."
Aren't diesel cars very popular in Europe?

"Yes, but they also have a lot less other shit in the way."
"That's a bit unfair as Teslas are packed with more tech than most cars on market.  And while most people probably can't or shouldn't replace a battery pack on a EV, basic maintenance should be similar enough. "
"> they tend to still have interior fans with motors though, which still have to be replaced sometimes, which are still usually a huge pain in your ass if you happen to have to fix one.

Most cars are not nearly that bad-- 3 or 4 bolts accessible from the passenger footwell (sometimes after removing the glove box) and you're good. The Volvo was just an unusually poor design (especially considering everything else on that car is super easy to wrench on!)."

"Not really, people tend to act like mechanical systems are super simple but if you've ever designed a thermal management system youd realize that pneumatics (i.e. valves) arent really simple.

Circuit boards tend to be easier to manage because suppliers provide plenty of documentation and stock control algorithms. Its similar to dealing with pneunatics as long as you have a basic understanding of inputs and outputs. 

I mean you could get into signal smoothing with electronics but you could also get into corrosion, turbulent flow, optimal pressure/temperature etc. with pneumatics.

Point being, cars are complicated.

Source: Engineer"
"> Any idiot can understand a valve, less so a circuit board. 

Valves don't think, without a sensor they aren't what you would call ""aware"". It can't tell you when it's broken.

Circuits can, you don't have to understand circuit boards, they understand themselves. Just plug in the diagnostic tool and do what it tells you to.

Yes there are more details that that, but it's the gist of all modern electronic repair, it's just swapping modules.

Hell these diagnostic ports are archaic as well. I see no reason your car can't do that over wifi natively. Why the heck is there no ""Android"" for cars? It's 2017 for Jetson's sake. Cars should have been emailing their owners for almost 20 years now.

""My belt is slipping. Time for my oil change. The mechanic just robbed you go get my brake pads back they were fine we only came here for an air filter."" 20 years ago that could have easily been a thing. Expensive... yes, hard no.

"Are you from USA? AWD S60 are very rare in Europe(at least in the Eastern part), I know they exist but I have never seen one. I think AWD versions are more focused for USA market."
Lost my old S60 on a crash in Lakewood. Hit the concrete divider at 55 mph. No injuries except for minor whiplash.
Why do you think I switched to Volvo?
Glad to see this here because it's my number one criticism about Tesla. Hope they improve it. My dad recently traded his Model S for an S class because of this. 
Or weights more with both a super and turbocharger and all accessories. There's no replacement for you know. GMs v8s are some of the lightest around. 
"I agree that it's about performance, not engine size. (I'm not going to go into a full-on, size-doesn't-matter joke, though.)

The problem is, the S90 makes 316 horsepower, which is low for a car in its price range. It's a full second slower to 60 than a BMW 3 series which has similar horsepower numbers and half a second slower than a price-comparable 5-series. 

Volvo either needs to use bigger engines or find another way to improve performance. I don't care how many cylinders it has if it's smooth, quiet, and quick. 

Per Car and Driver: ""While the E300’s four-cylinder is smooth to the point of being almost imperceptible, the S90’s engine delivers unwanted noise, vibration, and harshness into the cabin when pushed"""
"Japan's post-war development was indeed absolutely miraculous, but the rest of the world didn't really catch on until much later. Initially, the Japanese certainly had a lot knock off products (watch ""Know Your Enemy — Japan"" on Netflix - it's a propaganda film, but it is fascinating to watch). In the early part of the century, the best cameras in the world were German. A lot of Japanese companies initially just straight up copied them ([here's one example](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4oKMni3rpF4/UH7Yq3nAvyI/AAAAAAAADE0/yMWIxW98ssw/s1600/CanonLeica-2.jpg)) and many of them were not very good. The strategy was to copy and gain market share by having a low price point. They built on that foundation, and eventually surpassed the Germans in terms of technology. By the end of the century, most cameras were Nikons and Canons, and Leica was forgotten. The story was very similar with consumer electronics and automobiles. Japanese radios and cars positioned themselves at a lower price point, and the American public initially perceived them as being vastly inferior to the GMs and RCAs (post-war resentments certainly did not help). In fact, during Carter administration, Japan was talked about in very much the way that China was talked about during the Trump campaign. However, Japanese products were so damn good that by the '80s, they had gained the reputation they have today - so much so that people don't even know that they were once considered cheap knockoffs. South Korea had a very similar story, but their story was offset by 20-30 years. When I was a kid in the '90s, Samsung was considered a cheap bargain brand compared to Sony and Panasonic. Hyundai and KIA in the '90s and 2000s were what Nissan and Toyota were in the '60s and '70s. You can also find similar stories in Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. 

The formula seems to have been as follows for these Asia-Pacific countries. Shamelessly copy from industry leaders and produce low cost products to gain market share. Work extremely hard, and build up your technical knowhow over time. Through sustained focus, determination and innovation, beat the competition.

I think China is still in the early stages of this story. It hasn't been that long since Deng Xiaoping opened up their economy and kickstarted their rapid growth. I think companies around the world would be wise to take Chinese competition very seriously.

"Saab was also owned by GM and driven into the ground (partly Saab's fault, mostly GM's) well before Spyker bought it. There was nothing Spyker could really do.

Just because you're right it doesn't mean you're not crazy. 
"There wasn't that much hype in 1963, when it was just going to be a two door Fairlane."
See IBM.
"My very first interaction with an electric car was with an i3. I was working at the docks parking newly arrived cars. Sat down in an i3 that I didn't know was electric at the time and tried starting it.. nothing, after a few tries I had to get a supervisor to take a look at it and he just sat down and said ""The car is on"" lol."
"And unlike the non-Tesla electric cars, they're absolutely bitchin.

I wonder how long it will be before we can have a decent performing (sporty sedan driving, like a non-STI wrx or a non-M BMW ), good looking electric car for <30k. I don't need <4 second 0-60 time, just something that won't suck the life out of me.

A real, beefy, small pickup truck would be sick too. Something the size of the old tacoma but electric. With the instant torque of electric it would be killer offroad. "
If it really felt like they were into it I'd be with you. But it just feels like they were trying to beat tesla for the history books and that's it. 
"Yes, it's because they only plan to sell 30k units a year so they can get the max ZEV credits to sell their gas trucks and SUVs.

It's a solid EV, but it's a Spark in terms of size and design. Whereas the Model 3 is more like a BMW or Audi in terms of size and design.

That is kind of a big difference because with Chevy it seems like you are buying a 15k car for 40k because it's an EV, while the Model 3 and other EVs coming soon from BMW, Audi, Volvo, etc... will be similar to their ICE cars priced around 35k, but happen to be electric. I'm afraid the Bolt isn't going to compete in that space... even more so just because it's not a 'luxury' brand. Chevy's only option will be to drop the price, but that is hard because the battery is expensive and they don't have the volume to lower it."
My camaro gets 29mpg. I don't know if I'd say it's a gas guzzler 
Why is no other company able to bridge the yawning gap between the Bolt and the BMW i8?   I don't want to drive a subcompact and I don't want to pay for an i8.  
But the X costs 2.5x as much. And Chevy seems to have no plans to make more than 20k a year of bolts nor market them outside California 
A $38000 crossover versus a $75000 one. Which one will sell more...
Hyandai ioniq is great
"Right, but Nissan has sold considerably more Leaf's than Tesla has sold the S and X combined.

Yes, it's low ranged, but it's really not fair to say it's not a major player in the EV world when they've pushed out 100k more units of the Leaf than Tesla has with the Model S."
They certainly are. Mostly because diesel is cheaper per liter than gasoline. Which is because diesel is taxed less heavily.

> If the current has a direct pathway to the heart, a much lower current of less than 1 mA (AC or DC) can cause fibrillation."
"Right but it's significantly easier to understand how something mechanical works than something electrical.

Like, yes, an alternator is a small orb-shaped object made of a thousand pieces, but it's really not difficult to understand that if it's spun it makes power, and if it's not making power but it's still being rotated it's clearly an issue with the alternator itself. 

Like a carburetor is a million pieces, but if you're having power troubles and you take off the airbox, look into it and see one of the valves doesn't move when you move the throttle cable, any idiot with enough know-how to take the airbox off can see there's an issue and what needs to be changed to make it work again (In this case repairing the valve).

Whereas with a solid state circuit it either works or it doesn't. Even if there's obvious visual damage to it (Burnt out area, chipped board, etc) it's really, really not clear to Joe Average how exactly it's broken and how to fix it again, bare replacing the entire thing."
"Also an electric motor is a way less complicated design. To top that; no hard need for fluids for it to run, no complicated moving parts, pretty maintenance free."

The S90 was never meant to be a fast car, Volvo made that very clear. Their main goals were comfort and ergonomics.

If you want fast, you get a BMW 5 or Mercedes E350 or something or a Model S.


As for the engine noise, see I've seen a few reviews which said it was smooth and had no vibration and other like the one you quoted. Don't know what that means, bad production quality?

Not really.  The Chinese will cheapen up everything they can to save a penny. Earlier today I was arguing with our factory about the quality of a bolt they put on one of our products. They didn't want to spend the extra 1 cent for a nice looking stainless bolt.  Your pretty much backwards in your statement. They can make quality stuff but I'd say well over half of what is made in China is of low quality.  It's not that they can't. They just don't recognize they need for quality stuff. Like they literally cannot fathom why I want to waste a penny on a stainless bolt over a zinc one.  They think I'm an idiot.

Most electrics on the market including the Bolt, look like electric cars. They are very small and have a limited range. They look like European city cars, not your typical US sedan. Model S and 3 were the first electrics to show that an electric car doesn't have to look like a subcompact. It can look like a regular gas sedan. The Bolt rides a fine line in that regard, it is larger but still looks like subcompact hatch.

What we are discussing here is the electrification of compact and mid-size vehicles that look like a 'normal' sedan. It seems like Volvo may be leading that pack, besides Tesla. I still give credit to the Bolt because it is larger than a subcompact and has the range, just looks like 'electric.'"

The call out to specify an electrode or cardiac catheter, in my opinion, qualifies the concept of a direct path to the heart, which is the crux of the statement at hand.  So yes, if someone's rib cage is spread open while they're working on a current, and they shock their exposed heart... you're totally right.  But back in reality, that person has a much bigger issue, and the vast majority of peoples are without exposed hearts and have bodies to distribute the load and provide resistance."

I then got in my head, that maybe a Saab 99 was more romantic and cool. So I found one which had been sitting since 1982 for $125. I brought it home, and got to work. I planned a full motor, suspension, and interior swap from the 900, to the 99. I did the said suspension, and interior swap, and was ready for the engine. When lowering in the motor, the brake booster seemed out of place from the guides I had read, which the 900 motor interfered with. Then I realized the aweful truth, that I had bought a one model year too early for the conversion to work well. Being 17, I was not skilled enough to move the brake booster, so I sold the lot to a racing team in Ohio. That is my Saab story. "
"I'm actually in a similar situation where I bought a Model S and my father coincidentally bought a Mercedes S63 at basically the same time.

Just to start off with probably the most extreme concrete examples, the S class literally let you choose your own subtle car smell with integrated perfume bottles. 

Where the Model S have some basic very unrefined LED strips glued to the doors, the S class' entire interior is littered with some very subtle fully integrated RGBW lighting. Even the glass roof can somehow electronically change colour to match your interior.

Then there are things like leatherworking and the choice of materials. 

Even with the premium interior package, there are still a lot of rickety plastic that look ok compared to most e.g. consumer electronics, but is not even in the same game as the interior in the S class. Everything in the S class is either wood, aluminium, carbon fibre or thick leather. 

In fact, even insignificant things like the the pattern of the laser perforated speaker grills is just significantly more refined than anything one can find in Tesla's cars. This becomes even more apparent when one realise that the steering wheel levers in my Model S is literally the same levers that Mercedes use in their cheapest models.

Just to be clear, there's nothing inherently wrong with Tesla's interior; it looks nice and gets the job done. However, it's nowhere even close to comparable to the interior in the S class."

"This is just my opinion, but I feel that vertical integration, investment in the technology and operational scale would make a huge difference. Atleast this is the impression I have gotten by Elon's interviews and comments over the years. 

Involving a longer supply chain by default means that you have to account for margins of the higher number of suppliers. For instance, if you have 3 different suppliers that first process the lithium, transfer it, assemble a battery etc. and then sell it to GM, then all 3 need to make their margins. This could add anything from 10-40% on what it actually costs. Tesla wants to reduce these supply lines to the bare minimum which results in significant savings, bringing down the cost. 

It must be remembered though that a lot of companies outsource these processes because they feel they cannot do a better job than dedicated players. But if they could... They would rather keep it in house."

The Bolt, if it was more exciting, should've sold a hell of a lot more at that price range."
It's because the production is limited to around 30k a year. Has nothing to do with the price. The dude above was just saying that it's obvious that a 40k car is going to sell more than a 75k car (which is probably closer to 100k on average).

"That's true, that's the main issue with diesels. While they emit a little less CO2 than gasoline cars, they emit tonnes of NOx.

One of the most involved jobs that often requires​ total dash removal in most cars is the replacement of a faulty heater matric.

Most of the controls inside the vehicle are accessed through the touch screen, removing many of the cables, switches, mechanical linkages etc etc that that are typically used to operate coolant circulation, blower motor speeds, air flow direction etc. "
">I'd imagine there's more under the dash too since the engine isn't going to be powering the A/C and heater.

I agree on this one. The Model S lighting is adequate, but it could do much more. It could even shift to red if autopilot requires attention or something. 

>Everything in the S class is either wood, aluminium, carbon fibre or thick leather.

I knew the Model S was a step off when the Mercedes C-class has nice embossed aluminum window controls. Read that again: C Class. As in ""Under $40,000."" It's doubly hurtful that Mercedes supplies the window controls for the Model S. 

IMO, the Model S should have the interior quality of maybe an E Class. Remember, the bottom-of-the-line Model S is in E Class and 5 Series territory. 

I don't think they're there, yet. A lot of these things could be solved with a lightly-padded synthetic leather wrap over the plastic surfaces. 

>the steering wheel levers in my Model S is literally the same levers that Mercedes use in their cheapest models

Oh, I think the C class illuminates the shift lever symbols and I don't think the Model S does.  I don't care about the laser cut speaker grilles, but that's just me. I love how the Model X brings the wood trim down to the center console and out to the doors. I really wish they'd do that in the Model S.  The Model S center console is just black and there's no wood trim on the doors at all.

The range test cycle used in Europe is generous. Eg. the model S also has more range according to the European cycle compared to the EPA test.
"The distinction is:

Subcompact electric with limited range ~ 100 miles. This car is meant to drive around the city, it doesn't have the cargo room nor the range for long distance travel. Looks specific.

Sedan with decent range 250mi+. This car has both the cargo room and range for long distance travel. Looks like a typical car.

The Model S, X, and 3 are in category 2 (doesn't matter sold or not we know what it is). Bolt has the range but not the cargo room and, least importantly, looks like a category 1, so to me it's borderline... which is why I brought it up in response to the top post that Volvo is the first to bring a category 2 electric to the market.

I don't count category 1 as investing in electric vehicles, because those are compliance cars sold in low volumes to specific customers. Category 2 electrics require significant investment. They can be sold to anyone because they perform and look like a typical ICE car in that class, just have an electric drivetrain.

Because they're hatchbacks and literally every hatchback has that downside. Does that make regular petrol hatchbacks fake petrol cars because they're not built for long distance travel? 

Are we also not going to mention the Bolt is actually a better highway car than the Model S is since it gets better energy efficency at speed?

>Sedan with decent range 250mi+. This car has both the cargo room and range for long distance travel. Looks like a typical car.

Right so the Model 3 doesn't fit in there (Doesn't have the range nor does it look normal), so it too is now a fake electric car.

Now you're just making shit up, there's no such things a 'catagory 1 electric vehicle'.

>I don't count category 1 as investing in electric vehicles, because those are compliance cars sold in low volumes to specific customers.

Today I learnt the most popular and best selling electric car ever built, the Nissian Leaf, is a low volume compliance car. What does that make the the Model S, which only has 2/3 the units, or the Model X, which has less than 1/8 the units? Hand built prototype test cars?

There are only 25k Model X's, meaning it's only No. 8 on best selling electric cars. Yet somehow those other 6 non-Tesla cars are all, according to you, low volume compliance cars.

>I get some people don't care about this distinction and in that case there are like 20 models from the last 30 years whose manufacturers you could consider the first to invest in electric.

Probably because you're making shit up on the go so that you can decide what makes a 'real electric vehicle' specifically to disclude any other manufacturer.

Is this like the women cant be sexist argument?  lol

I think the market for the Bolt is bigger in Europe where its price is much more justified.  Worldwide I think thats an easily achievable sales number.  Of course GM just pulled out of Europe so who knows where that is going.

At the same time, I also think many in the EV world greatly overestimate the demand for EVs in the US.   I don't think any $30K+ EV is going to sell in big numbers here, Tesla or Chevy.  The Leaf only sells because you can get them for ridiculously low prices.  EV's wont ever sell in big numbers in the US until there is at least price parity with ICE.  When a Bolt/Model 3 start in the low $20ks, then you'll start to see mass adoption."
"I'm sorry you seem to not understand what I'm saying. This is my opinion, of course it's made up, thought that was obvious. I didn't say anything about fake vs real electrics, all I said is that other than the Model S and maybe the Bolt, those cars are not on par with their ICE counterparts, while the latter are. This is why both I and the top commenter agreed that none of them count, he didn't even include the Bolt and I could go either way.

None of this has to do with sales, highway efficiency, or much of anything else you presented above."
Well played. 
">How many Saabs have you owned?

Just those two, when I was yoing and stupid. I still want a good SPG

Yep. And freinds 200/700/850 series cars. I love how easy they are to work on.

"No, the term compliance car is defined by being created to generate ZEV credits so you can sell low mpg vehicles on the other end. Tesla just doesn't do that.

So how do you explain 500k reservations for the Model 3?

The Leaf was able to move 30k units in 2014, but has dropped to half that since.

It's hard to justify paying 40k for a subcompact with limited range. I personally believe Tesla will easily sell upward of 1M units per year of the Model 3. I mean moving 50k units of S at a 80k price tag shows you the demand is there as long as the car isn't a subcompact with 100mi of range, but instead a 'normal' car that just happens to be electric. I think GM could do it too if they didn't make an electric Sonic, but instead electrified the Cadillac ATS."
"I had this argument with a friend recently, or similar at least, about magnets. We were arguing about something stupid, and then both came to the realization that we have no idea what a magnet is actually doing. 

I'm having one of those moments right now. I don't now what electricity actually is. 

This is a depressing indictment of my education. "
"> So how do you explain 500k reservations for the Model 3?
> The Leaf was able to move 30k units in 2014, but has dropped to half that since.

You should really compare same things if you compare, i.e., global sales (around 60k in 2014) for Leaf if you are going with global reservations for model 3."
"Sure, but still nowhere close and doesn't change the point."
It is these risk takers we will remember in 10 years looking back on the dawn of the EV. Mad respect!
"For anyone interested, the talk can be found on YouTube here: https://youtu.be/oSUxxsRWmV8"

I want one of those batteries!!
"""He added that considering Tesla’s use of aluminum in its chassis, there’s no reason why both the cars and the batteries couldn’t last 20 years.""

Well... can we have that in writing? How about a 16 years Battery and Drive Unit Limited Warranty up from the current 8 years?"
Rocket! I told you to not steal the batteries!
Don't have time to read the full article right now. Are these the 2170 cells used in the 3?
From the article states that when temperatures are normal the battery suffers less as well. This can be very useful as heat in current batteries can diminish its performance.

sooo... can they now offer a switch out for old cells in old model S so they can get the longer life span benefits? maybe curtail that super charger speed limiting also?...
This will be the death of gas cars if the battery life is sustainable enough.
"Yeah, by reducing the number of fast charge cycles"
I'm confused... Tesla has battery researchers? Where does Panasonic fit in? Does Panasonic only do the lithium batteries?

So weird to see my first year physics prof on Reddit...
RadioShack just took a dump. Sayonara battery sales.
"Great news! I'm also happy to see that there is commercial backing to the technology, from Tesla as well as from other companies and OEMs. I hope for an even greater breakthrough in battery chemistry, beyond lithium-ion. Something with orders of magnitude more cycles before degradation."
Now make that old
"So...that's..uh..

8 lifetimes?"
"Does anyone know what was discussed when the camera was off?  

Sounds like that was when the real news was revealed!!"
"The video seems to have been taken down :(

Anyone got a mirror?"
"The video is now unavailable, was titled, ""Why would Tesla Motors partner with some Canadian?"", and was hosted on the MITEnergyInitiative channel.

https://www.youtube.com/user/MITEnergyInitiative

Here is a video on the same subject by the same person, probably what got him his job at Tesla. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qi03QawZEk - ""Why do Li-ion batteries die and can they be immortal?"""
"As many of you have noticed, the video is now offline. If you've downloaded the video please share it, otherwise help us get it back! https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6aish5/does_anyone_have_the_full_video_of_jeff_dahns/"
"If this was true then the range of the models s and x should be doubled at least if not more due to extra size of new batteries, so 600-mile range for the model s  and x at least NO!"
"Need to make batteries more ecological if ya wanna save the planet. 

Edit: Not looking to fight, but really no new materials are required to make new batteries I'm going to need see some info about that. I did some research. Most of the current modern li-ion batteries will be not suitable for recycling (having materials worth recovering for future advanced batteries). The batteries worth recycling are still not the common battery. And the right ones are not easy/cheap enough to break down and recover. Because of this users are strapped with disposal fees and most batteries don't get recycled. [link](http://gridedge.com.au/assets/facts-about-lithium-ion-batteries-20151108.pdf)   [and another](https://waste-management-world.com/a/1-the-lithium-battery-recycling-challenge) Bring on the down votes.

"Battery life will (hopefully) have a huge impact on sustainable energy effectiveness too, one of the biggest problems is storing unpredictable/infrequent energy for when it's needed most, for example mid-day solar production to evening peaks in power usage."
"They aren't even known today, how will they be known in 10 years?

If they didn't come up with a way to test batteries faster, someone else would have.  Rapid testing is the core of everything tesla does.  It is what Elon Musk embraces to advance so fast.  Its why his companies are ran like silicon valley tech companies.

For the most part, the name that will be remembered is Elon Musk.  Very few people near him will ever get mention to, that is just how things are."
"Jeff Dahn was already one of the world's leading battery researchers before having partnered up with Tesla, so it was a smart partnership. Jeff is a brilliant researcher as well as a brilliant teacher. I had him as my professor in my first year physics course, of all courses. I'm confident he's inspired many to follow in his footsteps."
This video is gives great insight into battery research - everyone should watch it
Very interesting talk.  Too bad the video recording was turned off at the request of the speaker when he starts talking about their current work with Tesla.
"TL;DW:

You can learn a lot about battery lifetime by measuring the 'Coulombic efficiency', which is just charge in vs. charge out.  You have to do it with very high accuracy equipment because we're talking about e.g. 0.996 vs. 0.998 being a substantial difference.

This makes sense because every bit of charge that you don't get back likely went into some sort of unwanted reaction that, over time, kills cell capacity.  The measurements, along with the intuitive explanation, go far in making a convincing argument.

This means you only have to test a cell for several weeks instead of a decade or more to get reliable information about its durability.  You can iterate faster and come up with better battery chemistry."
Appears that the vid was taken down within the last 8 hours. I watched most of it last night and now it's dead.
"Someone who understood please confirm... it was the 2% vaneline carbon electrolyte, which prevented oxidation, the cause of high coulomb efficiency,  in other words longer life spam?"
Cameraman was more interested in showing off his pan and zoom skills than he was in taping the actual slides being presented.
I'm imagining 10 % improvement in energy density.
"I need about 500 of them for my moped

How do I get a bulk order?"
Buy a Tesla :)
"Me too, I would love some for my vape"
"Most engines are only warrantied for no more than 100k miles, but if you take care of them 300k miles is reasonable, maybe more. "
"My Chevy Volt does things a bit different.  Only charges to 80% and discharges to 20%.  To date, not one Volt battery pack has been permanently depleted from normal use.  Some have over 100k electric miles.

Battery replacement is $3500.

It's not a Tesla, but it does have some charm.

"
"> 20 years

I drive an '86 F250 diesel with 250K miles on it. Original except tires, couple of water pumps, coup of fuel injection pumps an fluid changes.

I plan to make the P100D last longer, assume I am around. Battery swaps and regular maintenance should keep the P100D around as long as I care to have it.

"
*I'm gonna make some weird shit*
his research and his presentation are primarily in NMC batteries where as Tesla cars use NCA. But he did say his current job with tesla includes NCA batteries so he has had to kinda learn that chemistry from scratch 
Yes
"He is both. He usually underestimates the time things willl take but still do things faster than most people anticipate.

This wasn't his estimate though, it was something about a research grant for 5 years of research. The goal was to double longevity in that time and they've already reached it but they'll keep going and see how much more they can improve it."
This isn't /r/Subaru 
"No, you still have to charge, but you can charge it more times before you need to charge it more often."
"Durability is really the last hurdle in the public's eye, I think.

They're scared of the new tech.  Will it last?  Will my dad make fun of me of I buy an EV and it dies in 5 years?

There's a reason why out of warranty EVs are dirt cheap, and very little of it is rational."
"Its probably for more of a 'shared risk, shared reward' scenario, where they both split the costs of the research and have co-ownership of the patents that come out of it. Research is not cheap, and if nothing comes out of it, then its a major loss with nothing to show for it; With a partner, then its only half of a major loss :P"
"Of course they do. Tesla only relies on external suppliers until they can do it better and/or cheaper in house. Such as Mobileye.

They've hired several very high profile battery people, such as: 

https://qz.com/690936/teslas-newest-hire-may-be-proof-elon-musk-is-ready-to-hear-some-hard-truths-about-batteries/

The Panasonic partnership is helpful for both, but I'm guessing Tesla is driving most of the innovation."
Panasonic make the battery in the Gigafactory. They are the cooks. Tesla is the chief that owns the restaurant and the recipe.
"I work in the battery field.  I highly highly doubt Tesla is actually developing the chemistry themselves.  Panasonic does have some IP relating to batteries, but it's not big compared to Samsung, LG, and several Japanese manufacturers you've probably never heard of.  The current best in class lithium ion batteries are from LG.  I'm very skeptical that this is a break through that Tesla or Panasonic have developed.  I would like to see a literature or patent publication to verify that this is something different."

No they said they doubled the lifetime. Not the capacity.  Same range but it will take twice as many years for the batteries to start losing range and going bad. 
Making batteries live longer IS making then more ecological.
"As opposed to coal, gas and oil?"
"I think electric cars, along with highly flexible energy prices, could be a big part of the solution.

Mid-day solar is peaking: electricity costs $0.05/kWh.

Sun has set, no wind, everyone cooking at home: $0.50/kWh.

Your car doesn't necessarily have to charge the moment it's plugged in. When you come home and you still have 60% charge left from your commute, you could even *sell* some of that energy to the grid and make a little bit of money. An intelligent software may decide to charge the car at 4 am instead, when everyone is sleeping and the weather forecast says there'll be wind. Or it will only charge back as much as you need to get to work and then charge to 100% there if it's going to be a sunny day."
"Well, it's already having a huge negative ecological impact.

Just saying..."
"Elon's company isn't run like a silicon valley tech company, it is a silicon valley tech company located right in silicon valley"
Because Tesla will be a lot bigger and people will look to the key figures when looking back in documentaries etc

Was that the audio that was posted recently?
yea where can we find the goods on what was said?
Yeah. I watched it yesterday but now its down here as well.
I think that was only one of the many things they have done to double life. He wasn't revealing the full scope of discoveries
the expression he gave when asked about price per kwh hitting $100 tells me they've got some seriously good shit going on. 
That should be closer to a minimum of 20% if we are improving at the low end of 5%/year.
Good luck. See that long line of Tesla pre-orders? You go in the back.
I already have one. I'd just prefer not to rip it apart to get a battery 😜
I want Mooch to test it!
Miles isn't my problem. Battery age is. My current car is 15 years old and runs with the first motor just fine. 
Tesla has said in the past that their goal is a million miles for the drivetrain:  http://www.hybridcars.com/tesla-sets-1-million-mile-drivetrain-goal/
I would think there's a vast difference in engine life between an ICE motor and an electric motor. 
Most engine are not electrical engines that`s why

Not a bad deal at all. Pretty reasonable."

"Ya know... for how stupid that sounded, it actually made sense. This is precisely the tl;dr I needed. Thanks "
Elon did a great job of destroying the doubt of electric cars. 
I'd say charging time is the last hurdle. Pretty good warranty at the moment. 
"Yeah, I imagine that it's also the mass manufacturing expertise that Panasonic brings, they invest in the manufacturing infrastructure and get some exclusivity in licensing the tech to improve their own products.. or at least they have a profit share to offset their upfront investment "
Panasonic is killing it in research. I didn't even realize they had a research department. They are partnering with Tesla to improve batteries and have partnered with Disney to improve projection technology. I wonder what else they work on.
"> The Panasonic partnership is helpful for both, but I'm guessing Tesla is driving most of the innovation.  
  
Prof. Dahn somewhat touches this question at the end of [the talk that this article refers to](https://youtu.be/oSUxxsRWmV8). Skip to one of the last questions at the 1:06 mark.  
  
In short: There's **a lot** of research and innovation going on. Not just at Tesla and Panasonic. ATL (the worlds largest pouch cell manufacturer in China) has ~300 PHD's working on these problems. I quote:

What a strange tone in that article. Trying to drum up controversy between battery experts and Elon
It looks like Panasonic owns the recipe.
Please watch the video and report back with your thoughts. I'd love to hear your take on it. It's a very interesting video.
Pretty much by definition....
All used to charge batteries. The real issue with batteries are the production and disposal

I think Nissan is pushing fairly heavily for exactly this. "
"> you could even sell some of that energy to the grid and make a little bit of money.

I'm pretty sure JB Straubel doesn't like this idea very much."
"I'd rather be able to charge my car the second i get home. What if soemthing comes up and i need to run out on a moment's notice? We should be able to generate enough energy to do that, it's just that the answer isn't 100% renewables. It's a mix of renewables and nuclear."

"Buy a new one, et voilà ! :D"
It will come with time.  Cars didn't originally come with the warranty length of miles/time they have now for ICE. Think about how new all this is for EV's and already they have pretty amazing warranties.
"Yes and in that time if you have put roughly 10K miles on it each year you have put at least $1250 of gas in it each year or a total of roughly  $18,750 in gas over that 15 years. Additionally you have paid for 30 oil changes, tuneups twice, a timing belt, a trans flush, at least one starter and one alternator exc. 

"
"Maybe early adoption of this technology isn't for you. Wait a few years, continue servicing your present ICE (or a new one) and buy in once the EV standards meet the expectations you have for ICE. "
"So is mine but it had the drivebelt changed, brakeclamps changed and transmission changed.
  
The engine is fine though. of course oil and diesel filters where changef and topped of on a regular basis. as long as there is a plan on recycling/reusing/selling the batteries of your old pack I am fine with having to change them."
"There is an excellent chance a Tesla will be running in 15 years too with its original battery, but with a reduced range (hard to know how much of a reduction). Your current car at 15 years old doesn't have a warranty and if the engine seizes tomorrow there's no way the manufacturer will pay to fix or replace it. Why would Tesla have to do so for any of their cars that reach 15 years?  "
"Teslas battery degradation rate is 23 miles per 100,000 miles. Doesn't seem to bad, especially with the claims of doubling range within the next few years. 
    
Motor lifespan could still be an issue but I have faith in it so far."
could be you want to replace the battery in 15 years to get more driving distance... just saying.
The point was that it is standard in the car industry to have components last 2x or 3x longer than the warranty. 
Permanently depleted.

"Not sure what you mean. They got block 1.1 & 1.2, FT and soon block 5 our at reasonable times. however Falconheavy we had to be changed every time they upgraded the core. "
It's a stereotype that WRX drivers are avid vaping enthusiast.
That explains the 1% adoption rate?
"Ok, how about Panasonic selling batteries to other manufacturers?
What is preventing them from selling Tesla technologies? To the competition?"
"True. The battery is the solution to global warming. Renovable energy is only going to get you so far, you need to be able to store the energy, so that you can have a indefinite amount on demand."
Where do you get that from? Tesla has spoken often about developing the chemistry not Panasonic 
"Watch this

https://youtu.be/oSUxxsRWmV8"
"You know that no materials are used up right? That you can just recycle the materials and make new batteries over and over again.

Don't buy the propaganda that batteries are worse for the environment."
"Google ""Tesla slide controllable load aggregate""."
Also dont forget about the demand side. Every heatpump / cooling system with a water tank can shift its power demand. 
For good reason. Car batteries aren't designed to cycle that often. 
"The operative words are ""what if"". You want peace of mind? You will pay for it. You want to help balance the grid?  You will be rewarded for it."
"I think the thought is if you needed to run out on a moments notice, even a 50% change (100+ miles) would be enough to go get milk or whatever."
I can count on my third hand the number of times in the last 10 years that I needed to unexpectedly run out and drive 50+ miles after I got home from work.
"Well, eventually the hope is our EVs will have 500+ miles of range.  Even if there is a big of a physical barrier on how much more energy dense we can make batteries, over time the cost will come down and we can just use a bunch more cells for the same cost to get more range.

Add that to the fact that if solar and wind continue to get cheaper, pretty soon it's going to be *cheap* not just cheaper.  That would make all sorts of stuff better.  Cheap electricity means cheap aluminum, which means light cars for the same price, which means bigger batteries for the same weight/efficiency overall in the car.

All these interconnected technologies start building off each other very quickly, and we are right at the inflection point atm.  It's about to get real."
"Ill tell you how this will work, default settings, That way nothing is stopping you from doing what you want while the majority of consumers will be to lazy to deal with it, thus doing what the company wants."
"You could do that, of course. You would just have to accept that it's more expensive to charge in the evening. You could also tell your car to charge to 50% right away, so you can still get somewhere in an emergency, and then charge to 100% whenever energy is cheap."
"Middle-Canada, South America, China and parts of the African Continent. 

The mining for the rare Earth metals required for the batteries alone is done by massive strip mining operations leaving square miles and miles of ruined land.  The areas are not being restored afterwards, just left bare with massive mounds of rubble."

"I'm coming up on 4 years and 60k miles on my Model S with no significant loss in range.  That has to be more than 1000 charge cycles.  If the battery someday has half the original max range (say, 100 miles left) it will still be a perfectly good commuter car.

"Doubling range within a few years?

Batteries improve between 5-8% per year. That is 15 years or 9 years respectively to double their capacity."
"I thought your point was clear, and that's the right approach. Warranties should cover something close to MTF, not something on the longer end of the lifecycle.

MTF = mean time to failure"
or not plenty of components dont last that long and are changed at significant cost. Hell stuf like that is keeping garages and dealerships in profit.
"Yeah they started production of 2170 cells for model 3. No those batteries are not what the article OP linked to talks about. 
The gigafactory produces batteries for powerwall, grid storage and model 3.

I'm sure improvements will come to the model 3 cells too soon enough though."

"Oh come on! He's one company in a sea of car industry monsters. Things have change, but eveything doesn't happen all at once. Are you saying that just people haven't all gone out and spent $100k for a car means that they don't believe in it's potential?"
"That will likely happen, at least in the beginning. However i'd imagine their would be a couple of scenarios: 
1) There's exclusive technology that Tesla gets to use first, for a pre-determined period of time
2) Tesla would receive royalties from each battery sold, thus increasing their revenue even when people are buying their competition. "
"Things along these lines is also part of Teslas goal, to accelerate the transition into full EVs. "
"> you need to be able to store the energy, so that you can have a indefinite amount on demand.

I would actually say that you need to be able to store the energy so that you can begin to treat intermittent power sources like wind and solar as base load power."
">[**Why would Tesla Motors partner with some Canadian? [68:20]**](http://youtu.be/oSUxxsRWmV8)

>>In this May seminar hosted by the MIT Energy Initiative, Jeff Dahn of Dalhousie University discussed his research group’s new 5-year research partnership with Tesla Motors—the company’s only university partnership. Lithium-ion batteries are used in Tesla's vehicle and energy storage products, and Dahn’s research focuses on extending the lifetime of lithium-ion cells into the range of multiple decades, which is critical for energy storage applications. The key question that Dahn addressed at this seminar was: How can one be ""sure"" a lithium-ion cell will last many decades in experiments that last only a few weeks?

"An big electric heater manufacturer in the UK (dimplex) is also pushing for that in all of their storage heaters and hot water cylinders. 

Dimplex are getting fucked by emissions regs right now because the grid electricity is not as green (or as cheap) as natural gas heating."

No auto company has ran that way before, it is a notable thing.

You do realize the tesla factory is the old NUMMI plant owned by toyota and chevy, right?  If geography was the only thing necessary to run like a silicon valley tech company, then that plant would have already done that.

"Well, yes and no.  I don't think anyone is going to offer a better warranty that they will lose money on, they are doing it because the parts are fewer and will last longer in addition to making for a better competitive edge when comparing the vehicles."
"> Electric cars today kind of have to in order to compete with traditional cars

But they *don't* have to compete with every use case. It doesn't matter if they don't overlap with the market of rugged decades-old trucks or whatever, as long as their utility appeals to *enough* people. And of the billions of people driving, you can find a sizable enough market to grow on, apparently."
"You answered your own question. Horses didn't have warranties. 

Why do EVs have to compete exactly the same with combustion engines. It's a different model of ownership.  "
ICE cars started off by competing with the dominate electric and steam car market...
No that's gas at $2.50 and everyone's electricity rate is different so I didn't have reliable numbers to do that math. I figured someone else would do that part. 
"Seems about right to me. Exact costs obviously depend on where you live, but range by electricity vs gas is cents on the dollar and where I am gas is more often (and more greatly) above $4 than it is below $3"
in the US* and the US is not the entire world. Where i live its 6$ a gallon and usually its more than that upwards 7$.
"Gas is $5.44/gallon, and electricity is $0.14/kWh in my country"
I actually went with 20mpg which is generous as an average across all body styles
Ask Elon not me
"Bro, you ever smoked a blunt of dat blue subaru? "
"Well, you're saying the public had faith in EVs...  If that's true then where is the adoption rate?"
"Strange. Here is what I intended:

https://electrek.co/2017/02/03/tesla-controllable-charge-load-app-netherlands/amp/

https://electrek.co/2015/08/16/the-power-of-controllable-charging-load-is-tesla-working-on-a-bi-directional-charging-station/amp/

In that case fire up the generator.
"Weather disasters are usually foreseeable a day or two, so you can select in your app to not share any electricity anymore, instead storing it all. "
"SIL, I had always heard of Lithium as a REM.  I stand corrected that it is not.  It is rather difficult to extract in usable quantities though. 

I do know Official REMs are being implemented into not just batteries but also fuel cells.  List of REMs is on Wikipedia's page for REMs. "
How do u know whether or not I'm married?
Nope. Horses
"US avg. is 12c/kwh; but some places have extra low off peak rates targeted at BEV (e.g., 7c/kWh https://www.smud.org/en/residential/environment/plug-in-electric-vehicles/PEV-pricing-plan.htm)

You also have varying electric efficiency: Mercedes B-Class is 40kWh/100mi; MS90D is 32kWh/100mi; Ioniq is 25kWh/100mi.  Those will impact numbers to significant degree.

13.5k mi @ 25mpg $3/gal = ~$1.6k(25mpg ICE) vs ~$400(Ioniq), ~$500(MS90D), $650(B-Class) @ 12c/kWh."
"Not really. A rav4 gets more than that in City driving. A Tahoe, which has no real equivalent with electric cars right now has 15/21. The majority of cars sold are sedans which mostly get above 30. I drive a Mazda 3 and my average mpg is 35.6"
"OK, where did you see the reference?"
"It's as high as Tesla can produce them. Though you are right, it isn't really a great test yet. Once Model 3 hits full production we will see the true adoption rate "
I think the faith is there but the range is just not enough to cover all needs. And of course right now they are expensive in initial cost. Many people can't afford a car in that price range.  Even the model 3 is still too expensive for people with low income. 
"That's cool :). I guess the thing in the Netherlands is just to pause charging at peak times. I thought there might need to be extra hardware in the cars to allow them to work as household batteries. 

Your link reminded me that the leaf does already work as a household backup battery, although I don't think there is software yet to allow for peak time discharging. "

"Because it is clear you are not.  You want to argue for no reason and ignore facts other peope tell you.

I also know you are a republican too."
"Yeah, no. You'd think that a subreddit entirely dedicated to electric cars would know more about the history of them, but apparently not.

There were a fleet electric cabs operating in London in 1897, the ICE didn't really take off until 1912 when the electric starter motor was invented.

In 1910 the car market was at 40% steam, 38% electric and the remainder brought up the ICE, the starter motor was the start of the decline and a number of other problems (such as limited range and slow speed) all but killed the electric (and steam) by 1920.

Electric cars are really, really simple (There's not much functional difference between how a Model S or a $20 R/C car works other than scale), you can trace back electric vehicles as early as 1837 (They actually predate the petrol-powered car).

In MN it's 3c/kw off hour charging. Yay for me and my nissan leaf I picked up for 7 grand.

"
238 mile range is insufficient for the masses?
"Uh, hundreds of articles published (manufacturing and research) about advancements in battery tech...

Just browse the net, it's that easy. "
"Sure, but no.

It's like claiming EVs today are competing against natural gas powered cars. Yes, they exist, but they are a tiny negligible fraction.

ICEs replaced at least 100,000,000 horses and maybe 100 EVs."
"Also see related avg. miles driven by gender & age group: (https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm) ~13.5k mi.

Distributed by state.  Also specifies miles driven per licensed driver as separate item. (http://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/average-miles-driven-per-year-by-state.aspx)"
people want a car to be mobile without limitations... it is sufficcient for 99% of trips that people make but there is the 1% that kind of stings... for example if i want to visit family it´s slightly out of range which sucks because it means i have to find a supercharger and stay there for like 20 minutes making my trip propably like half an hour longer than with other cars... even 20 year old shitty cars...
"What? There were 13,000 Detroit Electrics alone.

>ICEs replaced at least 100,000,000 horses and maybe 100 EVs.

...There were 20 million horses in the United States in 1914."
"So maybe I exaggerated a little. Still, by your numbers, the market was 99.9% horses, 0.1% EVs. [ICE replaced horses, not EVs](https://www.inmotionventures.com/movement-disrupted/)."
I'm going to guess that 90 percent of the horses were for farms
"So we move from 99.9% / 0.1% horse/EV ratio to 99% / 1% horse/EV ratio. Still the ICE mainly replaced horses, not EVs."
Yep

Is their white pearl coat like a matte white. I heard it had more of a matte finish than the other colors. 
I don't think the white interior is leather IIRC. It's their vegan friendly interior.
Then its a win win

"Seriously, bikers are going down that road and not expecting a stopped car much less one facing the other way or even coming up the hill the wrong way.

"Not really. It looks pretty similar to the multi-coat white. You really have to look closely to notice the difference.

Correct. I have it. It's great. More supple than leather and doesn't stain. 
"I've never wanted a white car living in WI where it would be filthy half the year, but now I live in FL and kind of want white too. 

Also I just kind of assumed wrong on what the color meant by way of showing dirt. It's actually one of the more forgiving colors outright, and also has the bonus that when it's dirty you just wipe the dirt off. (With a dark car you basically have to head to toe detail it if you do anything or you'll see everywhere you cleaned at 1000 paces)"
"but with white, when it gets dirty it really shows."
I mean it's not like it's getting scratched just really dirty.

Yea I've always gotten the fake leather on ally cars. Never really understood the point of the real leather...it stains and starts cracking and wears more easily.

"I don't think it's so bad on dark colors. Just don't take it through the tunnel and use good mitts so it doesn't swirl and that's all it really takes, maybe a good wax once or twice a year."
You must've never tried to keep a black car clean. 
This isn't necessarily true. I live in Vermont where a lot of out-of-state skiers drive up in their white Audi SUVs and they still always look clean during the winter.

Someone make a shirt of Musk wearing a Tesla shirt

He'd probably blast the fuck out of him with some AC current like Edison did with those elephants.  GG Edison
"> Edison was just a marketer.

I'm not sure why people think this. He probably is only as famous as he is because of his marketing, but he was certainly an inventor on his own, and was at least partially responsible for dozens of innovations. Think of him more like a modern CEO than anything else. Steve Jobs didn't engineer the iPhone himself, but that doesn't mean he wasn't instrumental in its eventual design and success. "
Ironic.  Musk is more Edison than Tesla!

AP2 was stated to be at AP1 parity within one week in December.

..And now they're just casually still a few weeks away, 6 months later.

EDIT: He didn't even say June for the Rain/Perpendicular parking. He said ""Hopefully June for those too."" That's just him being wishful with no data."

Are we actually going to see Model 3 deliveries 2 months from now? For the Tesla veterans in the house-- when might we expect the Model 3 configurator to open for us pre-orders?
Homelink control is already in the app. Unless he means it hasn't been added for hardware V2 owners yet.
"""something cool""... Maybe auto pilot activated for free? One can only dream"
HA! Jokes on you!  July only has 25 days this year.
"I literally thought: ""What, they'll include the frunk all-weather lining for free?"""
"That is correct, although AWD is also tied to AP1 as well. [According to the Tesla Q1 2017 earnings call (at 06:05)](http://edge.media-server.com/m/p/9txdf9t7), Elon said that the 4 versions of Model S are as follows:

1. Rear Wheel Drive
2. Dual Motor All Wheel Drive and Hardware 1 Autopilot 
3. Facial Refresh
4. Hardware 2 Autopilot

Interestingly enough, on the call Elon also says that Model 3 is also on Version 4. Not sure if he's referring to internal revisions that have already occurred on the Model 3, or if he means 4 in terms of Roadster, S, X, and 3."
That's likely the break down.
What do people here think the likelihood of version 5 any time soon?
"That person he responded to makes me understand why he's pushing the anti-selling so much. People really don't understand that Model 3 isn't version 3, it's just the economy version."
Now you've don it....
I think he's talking about vehicle control. The lane markings on the display aren't that important going forward toward autonomy. They are just there to make the driver feel safer knowing that the car sees everything basically. 
What is RHD?
"> So much for ""continued improvements to AP HW1"" :(
> 

This doesn't exclude HW1 from future updates."
"I'm sure they will continue to do that, but just need to get the HW2 on par with HW1 at least."
"He said something weird: ""true avg drive speed"" not speed limit.

How the heck is Tesla determining the ""true avg drive speed""?

What the car really needs to do is allow you to match traffic no matter what. If there's 10 cars around, don't limit me to 5 MPH slower than them. If there are no cars, then the speed limit +5 is fine."
"Just that the control algorithm is re-built and ready to showcase next month. Sees the same things, but reacts differently. One example would be if you're approaching a stopped car, it will start slowing down sooner rather than waiting and slamming the breaks. "
There were so many angry customers who complained that they got the HW2 instead of the HW1 that they test drove as well.  lol
"I hear you. Mine was made the week before the change over. Still owning a HW1 car is better than no Tesla at all, right?
"
No.

"30 seconds after posting that tweet he probably fired off an email to a half a dozen Tesla employees saying, ""Hey, do something about this.  Let me know what by Tuesday."""
hopefully this includes those that reserved online March 31st (or even before the unveil) as I don't live near a Tesla center 
"Yeah,  like the actual silver of the alpha car. "
Already got something cool! He shook everyone's  hand in my line!

"If it's any consolation, I'm in the same situation. I'm sad about that right now..."
"me 3!  Reserved April 1st around 1300 EST.  So ""technically"" within 24 hrs of the reveal :p"
Yes captain :)
"I think he's referring to a full dedicated homelink feature on the app, not just part of summon. I have a garage door and a gate but with the app in its current form, I can only toggle the gate since that is what I have my summon feature set to. I'm assuming this change will allow me to be able to open any door from the mobile app, letting me choose garage or gate from a drop down menu. A small change, but something that would be very useful."
"With all the different time zones involved around the world, I think there's a chance April 1st could be included still. Reserved on April 1st myself and got the little poster."
"> How different, really, are March-31st reservation holders to April-1st ones? It took exactly the same amount of faith for both to reserve.

If you put down your deposit before the livestream started, you were doing so *sight unseen*. It's inarguable that people who reserved after the reveal had more information upon which to base their decision."
"To be fair, I drove 3 hours and waited to make my reservation from 9pm the night before, then placed $1000 into someone else's bank account because they told me the car would be cool.

I think that does require a bit more faith than reserving a car you've already seen online."
"> It took exactly the same amount of faith for both to reserve.

You do realize the car was displayed and rough estimates of potential abilities (minimum range, minimum performance, safety, supercharging...) was announced on the evening of the 31st, right?  That's a monstrously large difference for making a deposit on the 31st and the 1st."

"Right now, you can only access it through summon and only for the homelink that you have selected for summon specifically. I'm assuming that by homelink controls, it allows users to pick any of the homelink devices from the app with a drop down menu or something. Right now, I have my summon selected to open my gate which means that I can't open my garage through the app. With the update, it would allow me to open any of my homelink doors through the mobile app. Hopefully that's what he means.

Autopilot HW2 vehicles already have summon enabled which has the homelink button in the mobile app."
The last something cool was a piece of paper with some text and another one with a picture. So probably not.
"He meant the 3 isn't any 'better' than the S in terms of the technology. The same thing he's been saying recently. It's at 'level' 4, not that there have been four versions of the 3 yet. "
I think version 5 could be around the corner (1 to 6 months away). A new battery pack for example is still due. And a new processor for the main screen.
Errr... Those lines should be a somewhat accurate representation of what the car sees for lane markings. Would make no sense to have the car make up new lines to display. 
Right hand drive
and also more smooth driving on the curved highway instead of keep doing the correction to stay inside the lanes.
"Yeah can't please everyone. I believe it's the way of the future but as any normal person, I take to the internet to bitch."

"I compared the dimensions Motor Trend listed from their photoshoot to the ones of a new Honda Accord, and the Model 3 is very close in size."
It doesn't have traffic jam?
"Yup ! Very apt ! I can't wait for the release now.

Also I believe Santana Row and Stanford's mall will be the first two in the country to have a model in store ( again info dispensed by the sales person ).

I tried prying for any release / launch info but didn't get anything "
">Technically speaking, every attempt at SDC up to now were software limited aka no one figured how yet...

Not really. Without a fast computer you can't process all the data from the cameras fast enough. Even now the processor speed is too slow for Level 4 self driving. That's not me talking, that's the guys from NVidia talking and they are the ones building the hardware.

""Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang also stated that he expected Nvidia to have chips allowing for Level 3 self-driving features on the market by the end of 2017, and in consumer auto models by the end of 2018. Level 4 chips would then hit the market in 2019, and make it into consumer auto models by 2020.""

That's not a sensor problem and not a software problem. That's a hardware speed problem. [NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2](https://electrek.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/nvidia-drive-px-2.png?w=1600&h=1000) is not good enough for Level 5. Maybe NVIDIA DRIVE PX 3 will be. Even Elon said, that they may have to upgrade the computer hardware for Level 5. "
"Let me rephrase, as a day one reservation holder, I shouldn't expect to be getting my Tesla anywhere near July, right?

Are these units to customers, or dealer/testing cars?"
"I mean, I guess it doesn't really matter since most people won't have the opportunity to configure their reservations in July (the SpaceX and Tesla employees getting first pick) but that seems a bit close. Does anyone remember what the time gap was between specific details appearing for the Model S and X and the start of production?"
"As am I. At least we're in it together! If it's Signature Red and we miss the cut, I'd be so bummed..."
Yeah me too
"Ah, yes. That would be very useful opening the rear gate to let the help in. I could also use it to open the stable doors and the pool house side entrance. Not having to see the help to let them in is going to be a big bonus."
"Fair point. If I may offer a counter argument, it *was* a fully refundable deposit."
I just don't think it's a meaningful difference between someone who reserved 18 months before beginning of production and someone who reserved 18 months minus 24 hours before production. #notbitterhonestly #toycarsmatter
I agree with you. Those post-reveal reservers are so entitled. Us line-waiters deserve prizes!
Not if you know you can get your money back any time you choose.
Fixed. Sorry bot.
Maybe the next one will be a piece of paper with some text AND a picture!
"Something to hold off on buying an S then? Hmmm, hate waiting for news, dont we all? :P"
I understand. My point is those lines you see are just representations of what the car sees to make you feel safer. There's no reason to show those lines at all in a couple of years (optimistically). I think you are confusing those lines with being exactly what the car sees which is not the point. If those lines jump around a bit doesn't necessarily mean that the car is confused. It could simply be that the animation for the transition isn't there or something. (Bad example but I hope my point is getting across)
I just think it's really strange that you would make this comment when it's unrelated to the topic at hand.
"Why don't any of the pro union folks bring up tesla employees forming their own union? 

Personally, I'm a pro union person when it comes to the ideals behind unions, but many of the implementations seem to be corrupt, which harms everyone. 

Why rely on an organization like the uaw to do this? It isn't like Ford employees are going to strike because of work conditions at a uaw unionized tesla, so why link the companies together? "
"He said something cool, not something meh lol"
Burt Reynolds?
the two closest Tesla stores are 157 and 178 miles from me :(
so because you standing in rain means that others who reserved on the same day as you can't enjoy the same cool thing? that makes sense. I'd rather wait in the rain than drive 300ish miles round trip to reserve at a store. 
"last year, day of the reveal "
"He was like a little kid, with a sincere wide-eyed thank you for every person..."
At least it was cold. We had warm sparkling mineral water. Mmmm mmm warm. Dipped my cookie in it
"Westfield Century City, LA.

Closest location to his house...."
"Wait, is the model 3 or model s the same size as a Passat? I'd have thought S? Or is that even bigger again?"
So essentially we're calling bull on Tesla's statement that AP2 has '[the hardware needed for full self-driving capability](https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/autopilot)'. But it's just the processor holding it back and that is designed to be easily upgradable?
"> Even Elon said, that they may have to upgrade the computer hardware for Level 5.

Transcript:

>**Elon Reeve Musk - Tesla Motors, Inc.**
>
>The sensor hardware and compute power required for at least level 4 to level 5 autonomy has been in every Tesla produced since October of last year, approximately. So it's a matter of upgrading the software, and we can reach level 5. And if it does seem that we need to upgrade the compute power, it's designed to be easy to upgrade, basically access it through the glove box and plug in a more powerful computer, so we don't think it will be, but if it is, that's pretty easy to do. So the important thing to appreciate is that the sensor hardware and wiring harness is necessary for full autonomy, which is essentially having the eight cameras, the radar, and ultrasonics, that's in place, so with each passing release, the car's autonomy level will improve. We had a bit of a dip, obviously because of the unexpectedly rapid transition away from MobilEye, where we would expect it to have the MobilEye chip on the board as we transition, but MobilEye refused to allow that, so then we had to basically recreate all the MobilEye functionality in about six months, which we did."
"Something being hardware speed problem means that the problem disappears by adding more capacity, which is not the case for SDC. You can bolt on half a dozen GPU server on a Model S, but that won't help, because if I quote Elon, vision isn't solved yet. "
Has the Nvidia CEO benchmarked a lot of level 5 driving?
SpaceX and Tesla employees at first.  He's been clear about that consistently. 
"They could possibly be the first ""customer​"" (read: Tesla/SpaceX employees who ordered) deliveries... Anything beyond some of those would be shocking."
"Not only will you not be getting your car, you will likely know nothing more about it (options, pricing, batter size, etc.) until they start delivering them to employees."
Maybe the two of you should have tried harder. ;-)
"Yeah but it was still a fully refundable deposit on April 1st too, so it was an even playing field. Some people waited to hear the sales pitch and look at the car, other people said shut up and take my money. "
Can't get a refund on the time I stood in line
I agree with your point here.
"I think it's meant as a simple gesture for us that literally waited hours in line on the morning of to order sight unseen. That's the difference. Not just the fact that it was *minus 24 hours*.

In any case, I don't expect it to be some mind-blowing thing."
"It's meaningful. Line-waiters drove, waited in line, got rained on. Some camped out. All for a car we knew barely anything about, because we believed in Tesla's mission enough to do so.

Post-reveal reservers just clicked a button online while sitting on their comfy couch, fingers covered in Cheetle, lips emitting a bioluminescent orange glow..."
"I don't think you understand what faith is.  Faith is believing that Tesla is going to produce something you want and that it is worth your time and energy to go put down a $1,000 deposit for a car that you've literally never seen or know anything about (except that it's an EV made by Tesla) that won't even be available for purchase for well over a year compared to waiting a single day to at the very least know what the car is going to look like.  That's faith."
You missed one.
"That's one of the advantages of traditional car manufacturers structures. New cars can be expected years in advance. People will have to adapt with all Tesla products to just taking a leap of faith everytime, be it a car or a roof. "
"So why don't they have an option for the paranoid, that lets you see every object it recognizes?"
"I didn't suggest the UAW swoop in and save the day. I hold the companies responsible for making things right. In my mind if my workers have to unionize because I refuse to do what's right then its my fault. I do not think Unions are completely necessary if companies would do what they are supposed to and not be greedy. Now in this case with Tesla it hit a bit of a sore spot becuase I love what Tesla is doing showing these mainstream automotive companies that electric is here to stay. I cannot afford a Tesla I wish I could and if I ever get the money I would need to buy one without regret it will be the first car on my list (next to my SRT Demon of course). I am glad that Elon Musk is personally taking care of this issue, it shows that he does care."
"What do you expect?  Elon to come to your house and cook you dinner?

I may be wrong, but the early Model S models were called 'signature' and had a badge and a special color (just like the tweet asks).  That's it.  "
HUD Confirmed.
"I drove 200 miles, 400 round-trip, to do the reservation on the 31st."
"I'm usually not a selfish guy but when it comes to waiting-in-line gimmicks, I ease up a bit"
"Well they didn't care enough to be the first people in line. Those in line reserved there _before_ the car was revealed. I think that deserves more than if you reserved online, after the reveal."
"Ahh, not me then."
"Model 3 is about the size of a VW Passat.
Model S is even bigger.

Model 3 length: ‎4,676 mm (184.1 in) est.

VW Passat B5 length: 4,669 mm (183.82 in)

Model S length: ‎4,976 mm (195.9 in)	"
"Yes and even Elon Musk is calling bull on it if you read carefully. 

Here are some Elon Musk quotes about Level 5 driving:

""There’s more that can be done, but the sensor suite is not the full autonomy suite. For full autonomy you’d obviously need 360 cameras, you’d probably need redundant forward cameras, you’d need redundant computer hardware, and like redundant motors and steering rack. For full autonomy you’d really want to have a more comprehensive sensor suite and computer systems that are fail proof.""

Fact: Model S, X and 3 don't have redundant hardware.

In February Musk held a speech in Dubai. Interestingly, he hinted today during the talk that Tesla could need to upgrade the computer in the new vehicles in order to enable fully self-driving. Tesla’s vehicles are equipped with NVIDIA’s Drive PX 2 supercomputer and Musk said that it could be enough to surpass human driving, but if not, they could easily upgrade the computer.

So even he is thinks a hardware upgrade for the computer could be necessary to get it fully self driving. Nvidia, the guys who create the hardware are very sure that Drive PX2 is only good enough for level 4 at best (still impressive). I tend to believe them more than the extremely optimistic Elon. Level 4 will be possible (we will see it at the end of this year I'm pretty sure) but no way level 5.

Even if you replace Drive PX2 with let's say a Drive PX3 that is twice or more faster, then you still need a car with redundant hardware. You don't want do die on the highway reading your emails because a dead bug blocked the camera or the Drive PX crashed from an unexpected software error, do you? "
maybe thats what the full self driving option actually pays for were you to buy it with your car today.. your future hardware upgrade/swap when it becomes available from Nvidia.
Easily upgradable as in one wouldn't need to buy a whole new car to upgrade it if they already have AP 2.0 hardware?
"It's the software holding it back *and* hardware might need an upgrade. If it was just hardware, then adding more computers easily solve the problems, like how IBM beat a Chess grandmaster."
That confirms that you need to upgrade your car computer to get basic level 5 performance. It also ignores the problem of missing redundancy that is needed if you want level 5 autonomy (= you can sleep in your car). The existing cars will be level 4 at some point. Level 5 only for people who like to gamble with their lives.
"AI self driving is deep learning. Deep learning scales with speed. The more speed you have the faster the system can learn the data from drivers and cameras. Right now Model S is only using 2 cameras. If you use all cameras and have the GPU deep learning AI process all that data in real time needs a very fast system. The camera problem aka vision is, that the camera has problems with very low and very bright light (especially a problem with sunrises and sunsets on wet roads where you have blinding direct sunlight into the sensors but the environment is pretty dark). Here you could add additional sensors like Lidar and Radar help the system to still recognize the environment. You don't want your self driving car to be blind. But if you feed it with even more data, it needs even more processing power to handle all that information."
"[Yes and his team. They know what they are talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-96BEoXJMs0)

[Tesla and Google are not the only ones working on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmVWLr0X1Sk)

[To create the Drive PX2 you also need to know what it has to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URmxzxYlmtg)"
"Well yes, but what are we expecting as far as the difference in time between the employee deliveries and customer deliveries? Months, weeks?"
You are right. It's possible I misread the intention.
The deposit is refundable. No faith required to stand in line since you can always get your money back if you don't like what you see at the reveal. 
Hah! I did. Thanks :)
"its like annual phone released now. you know they're coming, but how long are you willing to wait?"
"https://electrek.co/2017/05/15/tesla-hack-autopilot-debugging-mode/

I'm just gonna leave that link there as a reference to what the autopilot actually sees in terms of references that are defined for it right now. 

There's a very good reason for not making a version for the paranoid: because it will make it worse. That's why the battery indicator is smaller now instead of dead centre. they want you to stop thinking about range. soon they'll want you to stop thinking about what the car sees and just trust that it's doing a good job with experience, not because you can see that it can see what you see out the window. "
"Badge and special color would be something cool. An icon on my tablet not as much. I was honestly hoping it wasn't special color since I'll feel obligated to get it, while my heart is screaming for that blue. 

Dinner would be awesome though, but I think I'll be the one cooking it :) 

Edit in case Elon pulls an Elon and actually does show up at my doorstep while visiting Cincinnati store: I don't actually cook that well, lower your expectations."
"matte black would be cool, if it's maroon red (again) I would pass"
haha nice. I thought about doing the same but work stopped that idea
"Same! OKC down to Dallas to wait in line. Miserable, but hopefully worth it!"

Uphill both ways?
"I can understand that if there were multiple Tesla stores in each state, but some states (mine) doesn't even have one..."
"Well to be fair... I care about my job more than reserving a car. Like I said in my situation, there isn't a Tesla within 100 miles of where I live and taking the day off in healthcare isn't as easy as it seems. Also, I absolutely reserved before the reveal. If you remember, they opened up online reservations an hour before the unveiling. So technically I did reserve before the reveal."
"In the US, our current Passat is 192"". It's a special boring version made just for us though. The Jetta here is 183"" so it's comparable to the Model 3."
"> There’s more that can be done, but the sensor suite is not the full autonomy suite.

Note that he [said that](https://9to5google.com/2015/10/16/elon-musk-says-that-the-lidar-google-uses-in-its-self-driving-car-doesnt-make-sense-in-a-car-context/) in 2015, so he wasn't referring to the AP2 hardware."
"Elon said (according to your quote)...
> For full autonomy you’d obviously need 360 cameras, you’d probably need redundant forward cameras, you’d need redundant computer hardware...

You said...
>Fact: Model S, X and 3 don't have redundant hardware.

Let's break that down.

- ""360 cameras"" >> CHECK, HW2 has 360 camera coverage.
- ""you’d probably need redundant forward cameras"" >> CHECK, HW2 has redundant forward-facing cameras.
- ""you’d need redundant computer hardware"" >> CHECK, HW2 uses Nvidia's PX2 which has built-in redundancy."
"> That confirms that you need to upgrade your car computer to get basic level 5 performance.

Well that certainly wasn't my take from reading this specifically:

>The sensor hardware and compute power required for at least level 4 to level 5 autonomy has been in every Tesla produced since October of last year, approximately.

Of course if it turns out to not be true, that certainly wouldn't be the first time Musk was overly-optimistic in his projections."
"I'm not sure if the redundancy is that important. If the system fails it will just stop the car and maybe you can design it with a not so powerful backup cpu that has enough power to be able to drive to the next safe stop and ring an alarm... 
Also the hardware is probably really way more failsafe than other parts of the car, like the wheels for example...   "
That just isn't how software works
"They're planning 50-80k deliveries in 2017, aiming for 5000 per week by the end of the year. So maybe 20k in Dec, 15k in Nov/Oct, 10k in Aug/Sep, 5k in July. Something like that.

SpaceX and Tesla employees apparently made [over 10k reservations](https://electrek.co/2016/06/09/tesla-model-3-data-spacex-employees-reservations/), but some of those will be unusual trims not offered in the initial run.

So, given all of that, I would expect about a month or so before the first customer deliveries."
The Rep at the Tesla store yesterday said he was on a conference call it it sounded like 2018.....
"I stood in line for mine, and I'm hoping to get mine towards the end of September."
"Ok, whatever man."
You're anti-selling your cooking?
"Matte colors are a pain to take care of.  People would complain about that.

http://www.detailxperts.net/blog/2016/01/04/car-paint-problems-5-things-know-matte-painted-cars/"
"That sucks, I only stood in line for an hour on my way to work at 7am."
200 miles = 321.9 km
"Level ground the whole way, really."
well fuck you and your state then! /s
"> I care about my job more than reserving a car

There's the reason you don't deserve a prize. Joking, but if your neighbor drove and stood in line, why wouldn't s/he get something more than you?

Since you reserved before the reveal, I may be able to side with you, but it's still not the same as waiting in line, in person.

I do hope you get something cool."
"continue...

""and like redundant motors and steering rack.""

...

[HW2 does not have two of each cameras.](https://electrek.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/tesla-second-gen-autopilot-sensors-suite.png?w=1000&h=502)

Every camera has a specific function and there aren't backup cameras for the 8 cameras.

How does PX2 have build-in redundancy? If the mainboard fails, there is no more PX2. There isn't a second backup system that the car can then switch to."
"""And if it does seem that we need to upgrade the compute power, it's designed to be easy to upgrade""

This sentence should ring all alarm bells. If they where sure, they wouldn't have added this sentence. Nvidia already did the math on their own hardware and they conclude that Drive PX2 is not fast enough for level 5 and is made for level 4. I think you should believe the guys who actually create the hardware to know what it can do. "
"That's my point. You need the hardware to have enough power to run AI able to process data fast enough for level 5 capability. [AI is self learning, the faster you self learn the better it gets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa__wkSmWUw). You don't tell the software in detail what to do, it's not classic programming. You feed the artificial neural network with tons of ""good"" data (videos streams of how humans drive and react) and it learns this data and applies the same rules to new data it gets from the sensors. The more time it has to learn and the faster it can learn, the better it gets. That's why you need super fast GPUs for this and the difference between Level 4 and Level 5 will be way more data and more speed to process it in realtime. AI is a bit like a black box. You enter good data, you don't know what the AI does in detail and you get results that resemble the data but applied on a new problem. The faster you can do that, the deeper your self learning network can be. That's why AI is know as a concept since the 70s but only started getting good results when people found out that you can use the super fast GPU chips from Nvidia to process this data."
"I'd expect July to be more like ~1k deliveries, also don't forget Model S/X owners also have delivery priority for the Model 3."
"Nope, I don't want that to be true. "
If you're not in California I think that is very optimistic.  
"Not going to happen. Employees then owners get priority, I'll be shocked if that isn't 100k cars. Half of all teslas ever produced. "
Ugh I spend so much time on this sub that a company's PR strategy leaked into my subconsciousness
"I'm aware, I've had a matte finish before, I think for a limited edition exclusive color, it would be appropriate. Hell, if Hyundai velostar owners can care enough for their cars, I think Tesla owners qualify as ""overprotective""

"https://i.giphy.com/l0IukNXgBnxRXVjYA.webp

but seriously, my state definitely has its shortcomings"
"Well, I doubt I could convince a neighbor to take off work and drive 300+ miles round trip to the nearest Tesla store to put down a reservation for me :P 

And I get it, there is something special for waiting in line for things. I've done it for other products before (remember when the first iPhone came out, geezus). I'd hate to lose out on something special since I just am unlucky enough to live far from a Tesla store. I put my faith pre-reveal, even if it was online and refundable, and would like to get the something special....but it's not the end of the world if I miss out on it.

Hope you put yours down March 31st and get something cool too! "
"> Every camera has a specific function and there aren't backup cameras for the 8 cameras.

The front cameras certainly offer a bit of redundancy. Enough to pull over safely."
The Elon Fairy responds to PX2 failures with .002ms latency and simply taps his wand to replace the unit.
"Nvidia also stands to profit a ton if they can sell two computers per car instead of one, so it's not as if they're unbiased in the matter.

I suppose we'll find out one way or the other soon enough."
Or maybe we have another Mobile Eye situation. Tesla can technically pull off L5 but it's outside what Nvidia would call acceptable thresholds. Just a thought. 
"Did you not read the word ""if"" -- did you just skip over it? Elon is just saying if they get there and can't actually do it, then the brain can be swapped easily. 

I presume this would be covered under warranty for anyone who has AP2 and has purchased FSD (and perhaps even EAP)."
"The difference between Level 3 and Level 5 is lots of testing to round out the edge cases.  It isn't about having more data being processed in real time.  It is about making sure you have the correct data in 99.99% of the situations.

You know exactly what the AI does in detail if you care to learn, but you don't need to know the details any more than the average new developer needs to know what a cache is."
"Yeah, I wasn't thinking that early, initially, but I'm fine with skipping dual motors and I don't want the performance version. So I'm getting a bit bold with my prediction."
We'll see. I get to skip in front of any employees or owners that are holding out for dual motors or the performance model. So I'm feeling pretty good about it.
"They're selling domestically first, no? More than half of all Tesla owners are outside the US AFAIK."
Yeah. Elon's brain worms have infected me too. 
"I did (in line), then bought an S 7-8 mos later. :) My wife is warming up to the idea of getting the 3 for her. Looking forward to potentially being a 2-Tesla family."
"Ok that could be, that that they manage to get to a point where they basically state: ""Technically that could be called level 5 but it's not safe enough in the real world and we can't recommend to take a nap while the car drives you, better watch the road""."
I think I stop the debate here. I believe Nvidia and what they say about their own hardware and you believe in Musk's best-case scenario and prefer to ignore the redundancy issue. Time will tell who was right.
"Aren't the higher end cars the ones that are getting delivered first? I thought the upscale models were going to be produced first, and the lower end (single motor, base version) cars would be produced later?"
"This makes sense from a production management standpoint, but how do people think this will be managed? You wait in a line of 400k and when your region/name comes up, they open the configurator and when they figure out you want an even more complex car, they push you to the back of *another*, smaller line for your region...?"
"I did the typical per month routine of getting online and finding a cpo that we could afford at the moment (we can't, grad school for both of us is preventing that). We will start with the 3 and if all goes well upgrade one of us to an S or an X down the road. Hope you are enjoying that S to the fullest."
The first batch won't offer the D or P models. So it will go by other options.
That's a plausible way of doing it.
"According to Model 3 reservation agreement: ""If you do not wish to enter into a Purchase Agreement at the time that
you are contacted by Tesla, you have the option to relinquish your
reservation sequence position and defer to a later position to be
determined by us (only one deferral is permitted). If you do not
communicate your decision to us within ten (10) days of notification
to place your order, you will automatically be granted your one
deferral and we will defer your reservation position. This Agreement
is not transferable or assignable to another party without the prior
written approval of a Tesla authorized representative."""
Then people don't even have a remote idea of when or what year we'll be taking deliveries. Shall be interesting. 
This says nothing about how they plan to manage the complexity of package add-ons.
