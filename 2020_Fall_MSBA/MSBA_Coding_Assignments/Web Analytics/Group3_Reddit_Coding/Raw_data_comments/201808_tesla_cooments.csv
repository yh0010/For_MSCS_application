">Earlier today, I announced that I’m considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420/share. I wanted to let you know my rationale for this, and why I think this is the best path forward.


>First, a final decision has not yet been made, but the reason for doing this is all about creating the environment for Tesla to operate best. As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders. Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term. Finally, as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.



>I fundamentally believe that we are at our best when everyone is focused on executing, when we can remain focused on our long-term mission, and when there are not perverse incentives for people to try to harm what we’re all trying to achieve.

>This is especially true for a company like Tesla that has a long-term, forward-looking mission. SpaceX is a perfect example: it is far more operationally efficient, and that is largely due to the fact that it is privately held. This is not to say that it will make sense for Tesla to be private over the long-term. In the future, once Tesla enters a phase of slower, more predictable growth, it will likely make sense to return to the public markets.

>Here’s what I envision being private would mean for all shareholders, including all of our employees.

>First, I would like to structure this so that all shareholders have a choice. Either they can stay investors in a private Tesla or they can be bought out at $420 per share, which is a 20% premium over the stock price following our Q2 earnings call (which had already increased by 16%). My hope is for all shareholders to remain, but if they prefer to be bought out, then this would enable that to happen at a nice premium.

>Second, my intention is for all Tesla employees to remain shareholders of the company, just as is the case at SpaceX. If we were to go private, employees would still be able to periodically sell their shares and exercise their options. This would enable you to still share in the growing value of the company that you have all worked so hard to build over time.

>Third, the intention is not to merge SpaceX and Tesla. They would continue to have separate ownership and governance structures. However, the structure envisioned for Tesla is similar in many ways to the SpaceX structure: external shareholders and employee shareholders have an opportunity to sell or buy approximately every six months.

>Finally, this has nothing to do with accumulating control for myself. I own about 20% of the company now, and I don’t envision that being substantially different after any deal is completed.

>Basically, I’m trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible, and where there is as little change for all of our investors, including all of our employees, as possible.

>This proposal to go private would ultimately be finalized through a vote of our shareholders. If the process ends the way I expect it will, a private Tesla would ultimately be an enormous opportunity for all of us. Either way, the future is very bright and we’ll keep fighting to achieve our mission.

>Thanks, Elon"
$420.69 and you got a deal.
TSLA has just been halted
That would be a market cap of $72 Billion. Did he secure a cabal of billionaires?
[deleted]
"Is he allowed to make ""forward-looking statement"" like that?"
Maybe this is the short explosion that he predicted?
"Holy shit. This is a huge update and he seems really serious. ELI5 what does this mean effectively??

edit: I get that he would buy at least 51% shares but what does it mean for the company. Why would he take it private if things are going well enough?

Most importantly WHERE did he get the money from???

Edit 2: welp, thats that and pretty fucked."
Are you not entertained????

$420 is definitely lower than my target when I went long.
"If this was true, would it make sense to buy stock now so it gets purchased at $420? That doesn't seem right. It also seems really weird that you could say this in public - wouldn't it make the stock price really volatile?"
"Here's my **speculation**, based on the events of the day:

News breaks that Saudi Arabia secured $2bil in TSLA stock. They've in the past asked for new shares to be issued for additional funding (which Tesla refused). Elon announces that he's thinking about taking the company private minutes after (with funding already secured!) at a very specific price point ($420/share).

Is this some high level billionaire drama between Musk (and investors) vs Prince Mohammed's 2030 vision? Tesla is the idyllic company for Saudi 2030.

Mohammed can counter a price to ""get in"" with existing investor groups, or be happy to have $2b give a decent return in a very short amount of time. He has no long term future with the company unless he is at the table talking about taking the company private. I am SURE he wants to be there for the long game. The stock price will inevitably hit $420, and he has some negotiating room right now to still get his foot into the door.

Why does Mohammed need to move NOW?

1. Musk keeps repeating, ""No future capital raises are needed"". Translation: we don't need you, you want us.
2. The company is expected to break even or have a positive EPS by Q3, definitely Q4
3. The ramp-up is now obvious to ANYONE paying attention. Factories are being announced, cars are being delivered, everything is chugging along.
4. This is a company that has faced the most brutal of media scrutiny, survived the recession, and is disruptive in every sense of the word.
5. The company is definitely overvalued, but priced based on what shareholders see 5, 10, maybe 20 years down the road. This is the whole message of Saudi Arabia 2030's vision, and the legacy that Mohammed wants to create.

I think Musk is telling Prince Mohammed that the company has a $70 billion valuation MINIMUM, and to get his foot in the door will cost much more than $420/share. ($420/share is assuming there is no dilution, but there obviously will be an internal restructuring).

Let's say Mohammed secures an additional 10% or so at $80 billion valuation; it's really just a drop in the bucket compared to buying when the company goes private and Musk/investors shut everyone out and buyback all the shares.

For a multi-trillion dollar fund, I think a few billion dollars is a drop in the bucket if Mohammed really wants to get a bigger slice of the pie. He's been happy paying market price for the past few months. Ol' Musky wants long term investors with conviction in his vision. He wants to know if Mohammed sees the same vision, and if he's willing to pay for it.

Us retail investors are on the sidelines while Musk and his investors are negotiating the terms of taking the company private with Mohammed behind closed doors.

**TL:DR;** Musk's tweet is a power move to increase valuation and hype through Saudi Arabia's sovereign fund stock purchase, further driving up the stock price. SEC be damned, Musky don't care. Fuck the shorts. Eventually Musk still wants to make the company private, but is willing to keep it public if the shorts burn hot enough."
Think there’s a chance we could exchange current stock for non-voting stock instead? Would like to keep some of the company but am totally cool with E calling the shots. 
"Holy Shi...

As a shareholder this kind of makes me sad, but knowing that shithead shorts will be burned and never get a chance to recoup their money from Tesla puts a huge smile on my face."
DAMN - so if your short - you have to pony up @420 to cover?
"But what will happen with all the drama?

Does he even think one bit of all the financial reporters that rely on TSLA ""stories""?"
Elon apologizes to shorts on Q2 earnings call cause he knows deep down he’s really about to burn a hole in them. 
"
So...is there an advantage to tweeting this information?    Seems like an odd thing to make public via Twitter.   


(FWIW - I just want them to succeed long term, if that means going private so be it).  "
""" My hope is \*all\* current investors remain with Tesla even if we’re private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity’s SpaceX investment. ""

Awesome news!

Edit: And this may drive the stock even higher as people climb on board so they get private shares."
"wow... I see how it makes sense, but I've enjoyed owning a piece of history in a way other than buying a car. "
Gotta use all those bitcoins for something 
"So its worth noting he is proposing a price based on funding sources not what the market of shareholders would potentially accept. It is not only a premium above where it currently trades but also the all time high. The price needs to be high enough to induce sales. In a normal stock anything from a 10-30% premium is normal but Tesla probably has a weird set of shareholders in that expectations are a lot higher for growth.

The usual way it would work is that the price needs to be high enough for the board / shareholders to accept. Not everyone needs to accept it. It could be forced on everyone so once its accepted, all shareholders get paid out at the price. This commonly leads to dissenting shareholders filing a lawsuit in Delaware for appraisal. [https://www.appraisalrightslitigation.com/appraisal-rights/](https://www.appraisalrightslitigation.com/appraisal-rights/)

Basically you can sue after a merger or acquisition and claim it was undervalued and you should have received more. Anyone that sues can win  more. This is something that came up in the big Dell going-private acquisition. Its particularly sticky when a controlling/major shareholder + founder/leader is taking it private with outside capital. They theoretically are conflicted and could have manipulated the price by making the outlook worse publicly than they believe (that is they talk with the private capital source about all the growth potential, but tell the public shareholders how everything with the outlook is bad, encouraging them to sell). This is kind of the opposite of Musk, who is constantly claiming the value is higher (hurting his ability to encourage shareholders to sell their shares for a \~20% premium).

He seems to be suggesting no one would be forced to sell and they could instead join the private thing. This seems a bit odd and unique. But in theory it would segment the shareholder base more into those that are happy to sell at 420 and those that are happy to accept a 420 valuation of their shares into a private ownership structure (and the negative and positive impacts on their ownership that would occur). The only people left who would disagree / potentially sue would be those that dont want to go private and dont accept $420 as the right value.

I dont know how his special purpose vehicle to hold those shares would work, but it seems complicated as he'd want to actually be private. But in theory you'd have quite a diverse base of shareholders within that SPV. They would still need someone representing them to make sure their rights as minority shareholders are protected. They would also likely want to be able to sell shares in some form of a OTC transaction.

My view would be that if he really does have a mechanism to allow those that dont want to sell to join the private ownership structure (that protects their rights and is legal), this should be relatively easy to do if someone like Saudi Investment Fund has the $20-40 billion necessary to acquire the rest.

The biggest risk is that its a lot harder for a private company to raise capital outside of debt. Convertible debt or equity raises are potentially harder (unless there are just people that want to join...maybe there are)."

"Honestly, with someone as...outspoken as Elon at the helm, this is probably a good idea.

Assuming they actually have the funding that is."

*Short burn of the century*. He tried to warn them.
420....heh
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I want to remain a part of this 😢"
Best thing that could happen to this company. I'm advocating for this to happen for very long time. Very happy he is seriously considering this.
"Ouch, shorts!"
Highly doubt that he can take the company private at $420.. many investors will want a much higher premium than this over the current market price. If Tesla is going private it will be closer to 500 if not higher imo.
Deepak is having one hell of a day...
Elon pls I still want to own some of it.

"Do anyone else think it's because he sees how much money they're going to make, theyre successful, and he'll use this money to go to mars?

That and not have to comply with all the rules and regulations of being a publicly traded company...obviously it's not up to us and it'd free up a bunch of money for me while making me money...but i really like owning tesla stock.

Edit: just thinking out loud, this can't be considered stock manipulation if he doesn't, right?"
TSLA trading suspended.
"Holy monkeys this would be so good for Tesla! I've been getting dwindling excitement for the possible future innovations of Tesla, but this would massively change that. Super excited."
"Pretty cool tweet, but honestly I bought a lot of TSLA for my little kids.  I was never going to sell, just holding out that it might end up like apple stock from the 80s.

edit: So I'm just catching wind of all of this....sounds like I don't have to sell if I don't want to?"
Suck it SHORTERS. 
"I hope this didn't come to fruition. I want to invest in this company. I see the benefits of not having to deal with Wall Street, but still. Don't do it!"
NOOOOOOOO ELON! Share the Alpha!
"Maybe he’s doing this because he feels like being a public traded company he is having to manage the company in a way he doesn’t like. I’ve read a lot of opinions from Tesla Longs and they feel like it’s a big mistake to do everything they are doing to be profitable this quarter. They should manage more like Amazon and keep investing everything back into expansion and not worry as much about profit so soon. 

Just a thought of why he would do this. "
Well...this escalated quickly

This should ally some fears.  Why not keep small investors on board?  Who ever is coming in with big money should own the smallest portion possible to allow the company to go private.  "

"$420 maybe, $450 definitely. "
"Then perhaps a private Tesla can execute according to vision more like SpaceX is doing.  Might be very good for development of Autopilot and FSD.

Elon's been watching too many Papa Johns' commercials lately.
Wow he must really not like earnings calls
How many shorts covered their positions while simultaneously crapping their pants when Elon sent that tweet out?
Why was this done while the market was open?
So should I buy as much Tesla as I can right now since selling it for $420 is an easy 10% profit?
As soon as I saw this tweet come through I dropped my lunch and ran through the halls back to my computer and bought some call options then sold them after a few minutes. Thanks for the quick $$$ Musk
"I just hit an auto sell on most of my shares at 365 that i set up hoping  it would be a short squeeze.   Now i see this.   wish I didn't sell, now only have one share."

"Bois, we goin private?????"
I would hate to lose the opportunity to stay invested
"He probably should then. It sucks that I could no longer be an investor, but it would be a lot better for the company."
What happens to people holding Call Options expiring after this would take place?

What is “either scenario?”
This makes sad... and happy. I mean cool if it helps the company move forward and make the planet better. I look at my shares half as a financial investment but also half as a investment in the planet. I *want* tesla to succeed for the sake of the planet and I'm ok with risking some of my dollars to support that goal. I don't want to be shut out of voting with my dollars. If he takes the company private I guess I would have to reevaluate and invest in Tesla's downstream suppliers.
"""I don’t have a controlling vote now & wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won’t be selling in either scenario.""

Can someone explain to me what he means? Does it mean he wouldn't sell (i.e. go private) if the sale resulted in a single person having a controlling vote?"

"This is a brilliant move by Elon to tweet this.  It beats these slimeball short-sellers at their own game, using their own tools against them.  And if he does take Tesla private, even temporarily, it will be good for its long-term planning.   SpaceX is a perfect example."
Tesla: now specializing in emotional rollercoasters!
Why didn’t shorts cover today? They now know the stock is going to 420. And price cheaper than that is better for them.

"Short Burn of the Century, courtesy of Elon's Flamethrower"
How does he decide on the $420 amount?  It was trading below only $350 before he made the tweet.
"Musk: “I am serious, and stop calling me Shirley.”"
"Google. In June he 'liked' the tweet where someone told it's a good idea. I was shocked no media picked it up (it would be funny tho, because it was just a like)"
What is the strategy from Tesla short sellers?
"I know this investor type that made a big deal about shorting tesla a while back, am I correct in thinking he'd lose a lot of money if this happens? "
"Wouldn't you want to take it private a low price, not a high one??"
Does every share holder get 1 vote and 50% can decide to sell or is the vote proportional to what you own? If you have 25% of the stock does that make your vote worth 25% of the choice to sell? 
Hands down I thought it was a joke
"This could be even better for innovation. 

Convincing a few investors to go along with a new plan is a lot easier than convincing a ton of shareholders. "
"I'd sponsor this if I had the money. This circus must end, they're gambling with a far too important technology."
Maybe Elon has discovered cryptocurrency for real.
Holy shit my TSLA just blew up. Was wondering why. 
It's like he's just trolling at this point. 
What if is only to mess with the shorts?
$420.. interesting number...
Any insight into how this affects Jan 2020 call options for instance?
"Ah...what I'd give to be a fly on the wall in shortville right now. Regardless of what the outcome is, I bet they're all going crazy right now."
"So how does this work out for shorts? They need to buy shares to cover their positions but with that many short shares outstanding the price may quickly head toward $420. Could the price actually skyrocket past 420 as they scramble to buy shares? This is gonna be crazy.  


I'd be surprised if they can cover all those shorts under $420."
"On the one hand, I think it would help further the company's mission by removing a major distraction for management. On the other hand, it's a terrible loss for those who have a chance to build substantial assets by going along for the ride."
Just reopened trading after a half and is hitting higher highs. 
holy shit trading resumed 
How does this effect those are holding shorts?
I'm a bit confused. Can I be forced to sell my shares?
Looks like the Saudis are stepping in...
can someone eli5 this?  would this be good for shareholders?  what do i need to know?
"This may be a silly question from a layman, but what would stop people from shorting a private company?  Isn't it just a contract between an owner of some deed (public or private) and a third party?  Could that not be done with a private investment?"
"Why pre announce it though? Won’t it only drove up the price (as shown today)? 

So now the premium for the buyback will have to be over $420?"
"His email says  ""First, I would like to structure this so that all shareholders have a  choice. Either they can stay investors in a private Tesla or they can be  bought out at $420 per share""  how would it work if you stay as an investor but the company is private?  How would you track the price or sell them at a later date if it's not listed? "

Doesn't this scenario scare off the institutional investors?

Damn..wonder what my ARKK funds will invest in now.  
[deleted]
"Ok, first of all, WHAT. Second, assuming he's right on this, this would be a no-brainer time to buy right?"
big if true
Who decides if a stock is halted? The SEC? Did he break any rules?
"Can someone explain what this means (assuming it happens) for:

Shorts

Teslas debt that is tied to the stock price

?"
Trading on TSLA has been halted as of 2:08 Eastern Time. 
Could you imagine being able to make millions just by sending out a tweet?
What does this mean for ordinary public shareholders? Is there a chance they will lose their shares?
"So, question: let’s say you’re an employee who was awarded RSU’s and options that vest over four years. Elon decides to go private @$420. Does that buy out include all shares that an employee would own, vested and non/vested? Or only the RSU/options that have vested.

"
I wonder if this is also why they avoided capital loans for expenditures (aside from the bond rating)... Debt burden could have complicated the public-private transition?
"Generally, only accredited investors can buy into privately held issues. Many Tesla investors are not accredited because they aren't millionaires."
so does the stock open at $420? now wouldn't that be awesome?
"So if they went private it means I can't buy anymore tesla stock, but I can sell it if I choose? What will happen to the shorts? Will it go up massively like vw did? Or slowly cause they are now private? I have no idea about stocks "
"Have the Shorts started to cover yet? When the expected ""Short burn of Century"" failed when Tesla made 5k Model 3 cars and instead the Wall street brought the stock to under $300, Elon must have thought about this plan to still make the ""Short burn of the century"" happen. This is it. "
"Trading halted at around 2 pm. At $367.25. I plan on staying in,  if as Elon has said, he hopes, all investors do.  Wondering how that 
 works at voting time."
"4 hours ago, big stock jump..."
"well at least we can make ""some"" $$ on the exit, that 420 price is not bad... although t I wonder if its a pun on typical ""420"" references... "
God I just hope he knows what he is doing
But where is the funding coming from?
"Can someone explain what this would mean? I know it means the stocks can't be traded publicly, but to be honest, that already only kinda makes sense to me."
"Newbie questions:

1.  If he's considering taking Tesla privae at $420, couldn't you buy now at $360-370, ???, then profit?
2.  A lot of conversation here, but how many shares would one have to own for this news to make a difference?  "
Is he trying to manipulate the market?
No idea what this means but I like number 420. 
So invest now? 
I own all my shares in Robinhood. I wonder what will happen if I choose to stay.
What is the significance of this? 
Hopefully he doesn't get in trouble. He might have to at least prove he can do it.
"> Funding secured.

I hope is KKR. I want to see a movie made of this, *Barbarians at the Gate*'s style."
R/wallstreetbets 
"To Elon:

If you are doing it to get rid of negative pressure from all sectors including the media, don't bother. Shorts are just the victims of the lies of fossil interests. The pressure will continue.

If you are doing it because going private gives you more opportunity for growth then do it. But please, beware of power moves against your control of the company. 

edit: BTW, whatever you choose I have faith in your choice."
"Serious question, what if I don’t want to sell my shares, will I be forced to?"
Nice.
Wouldn't he HELP the shorters by doing this though? They obviously can't buy back the shares at a lower price in the future if company is delisted?
Can someone explain to me why is this a good or bad thing? What happens if Tesla goes private for stock holders 
We need some update from Elon... I am getting slightly concerned about whole thing...
In my pension I own a bit of a fund which is 10% Tesla. What happens in his situation? Do the fund managers just get the money and invest it elsewhere?
[deleted]
"He posts downfall meme, then this?? He is trying to troll the stock market."
"Question, could this be an attempt to hide that Tesla may not be profitable in Q3?  I'm not sure how private/public works in the financial sector, just a thought I had.  I've got not stake in the game."
Yea this is highly illegal. That’s stock manipulation. 
"Translation: ""Pump pump pump"""
yes please
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but knowing Elon, isn't this a pretty obvious weed joke/not serious consideration?  Looks like news is running away with what seems to be a joke.  "
"Who tries to pump a company's stock so he can take it private at an all-time high?! If this is true, his tweet literally just cost his financiers billions of dollars."
Waiting on that base model 3
[deleted]
[deleted]
Big if true.
Could this be a twitter account hack?
Someone please tell me he's trolling. I would be devastated!
"He can pay me 420/share and I'll buy a TM3,thanks "
Wouldn’t this move significantly hurt Elon‘s intention to use TSLA increase in valuation (on the stock market) to fund Mars ambitions?
"If this is legit, stock price will soar close to $420 and would be that short burn he promised was coming. Just ""a few weeks"" later than he said, but right on Elon time.."
[deleted]
Would this be a taxable event for shareholders?
What are the chances Elon is hacked?
420 maannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
How does this work if I’m not gonna sell!?
How will this affect his plans to use TSLA to fund SpaceX’s mars ambition?
\\\//\ 420 errrryday
For those of you with a small investment in tesla this is a golden opportunity to sell for 420$ . This valuation is insane. Massive congrulations to all shareholders. For the love of god don't follow Elon when they go private unless you're willing to wait 20 years to get your investment back. Golden opportunity. 
No more earnings call no more annual shareholder meeting :(. I hope this doesn’t pass
"When it will go private, can we still buy some stocks?"
420? Blaze it! 😁
"420 Blaze it. Like his stock will. In flames.

Just kidding I have no idea, I like his projects. "
He’s trolling Wall Street. Smoke weed erryday #420blazeit
I don't want to sell my shares. I took a promise on myself to buy as many TSLA shares as I could from every salary. I was using it as my savings account. Please don't do this to me.
"Musk better be serious about this, otherwise, SEC can investigate him for stock manipulation."
"He's fucking the short sellers by intentionally driving the stock price up. When it gets to 420 he'll change his mind. Well played Sir, well played."
I think Elon's twitter got hacked... $420 is a marijuana reference...
Probably a 420 joke
So we should expect to see an 8-K today?
[deleted]
Is this a devils lettuce joke?
Do it 
Blaze it
Now I wish I could afford just one piece of stock. Let alone a Tesla. :'(
..
"Elon's tweet is genius! Now, everyone thinks the stock is going to $420 - so they buy in now DRIVING THE STOCK TO $420. Then, Elon has a change of heart and doesn't take the company private. Quick way to raise a shit load of cash."
"I think this is Elon’s round about way of saying that Tesla won’t be profitable in the next quarter, as promised. "
[deleted]
If the long thesis holds it means this future trillion dollar company will be owned by no one buy himself and whoever is providing the funding.
"Do you think he’s realised that making a model 3 for $35k isn’t possible, and failing to meet the expectation that a lot of the share price is based upon would possibly bankrupt the company, so this is a better option? "
"Elon needs to show he had funding. This is straight up stock manipulation by a named executive. 

SEC better hold this punk to the fire here or we will have exec stock pumpers all day backed by falsities

Edit: /s"
Apple should buy Tesla
This has to be market manipulation stating the $ per share. He is tryna screw over short sellers imo.
"I am going to sleep now - hoping that this all is still true when I wake up tomorrow.

I am not long or short, probably will never be able to afford Tesla car, but last thing I want to see is Elon going to jail, because he once again did not think this through..."
I reallyreally  hope he does this. Fuck the shareholders. Fuck the media. 
Could this be a ruse to create a short squeeze?
he'll get sued for this ya drones.
"Too much debt.

Not gonna happen.

Enron Musk needs to put the bong down."
"Asking seriously, isn’t this sort of comment some sort of SEC violation? “Considering” isn’t exactly a commitment but a good way to pump the price. I’m long the stock so not complaining but ... "
He’s such a total liar. Anyone who believes this deserves what they get. 
[deleted]
"Nice. What is the source of that?

Btw - trading is open again.  "
This should be the top post. Shouldn't share prices get closer to $420 if he is expecting this to happen? 
Can someone explain how buying and selling shares work for a private company? How is the price determined?
This is a great idea. I was just talking about this with my brother a few weeks ago.  I'm in  aerospace and have worked with SpaceX. I can't think of a better way to quiet the carnival barkers and let Tesla concentrate on their product as SpaceX has been able to.

"Somewhat disappointed he didn't tweet it, he is maturing. 😢 "
"1420.69, then deal."
It's back! Up to $384 atm
Wow.  I had to check.  I don't recall owning a stock that had been halted ever.

Jeff got his back.
"> Did he secure a cabal of billionaires?

Have a look at the current investors... yes.   Did he find more?  Maybe."
"Well he does have some friends that own like, Google and stuff :)"

"He doesn't need much new investors, he can make a deal with some of the current large stock holders. He needs large stock holders on-board anyway to be reasonably sure of a positive stock holders vote."
"Berkshire has a measly $111.1 billion in the bank.  Could easily buy. lol I know, I know... not the right type of investment for Warren. "
Apple has like 100B in cash....
I'm guessing Saudis.  They already own a big chunk of Tesla. 
I'm sure HSBC could provide a loan
I bet on Saudi Arabia or China.
This would likely be a deal with private equity firms and a portion would certainly be funded by debt. 
He does live in silicon valley surrounded by billionaires.
"Nah, the Tesla Roadster in space was really an advanced mining robot. It just landed on an asteroid made of unobtanium  and is sending back to earth the first load. A secret SpaceX Mission will retrieve it from earth orbit."
"I think it's actually $82 billion and since Saudis are pulling all their money out of Canada and he doesn't give two shits about human rights, I'm sure Elon would be more than happy to find a new home for all that blood money.  "
As foretold by the prophesy
Yes
What's a short burn?
"GET REKT CHANOS. EAT SHIT EINHORN. HERE'S A BAG OF DICKS FOR YOU, SPIEGEL, DON'T THINK WE FORGOT ABOUT YOU."
"Best would be if he declared it TODAY, locked trading, buys 90% of shares and lets the rest float at a RETARDED high market cap crushing shorts on a small overbought market. "
"Well it’s not *quite* at an all time high... close, but not quite there. 

But yeah F the shorts."
God I hope some really stupid people's finances are completely ruined by this. 
"What does that mean?

If you're shorting Tesla how does it work if the stock goes private? Let's say your short expires December 2018 and the stock goes private in October, is the price essentially considered frozen until then so you lose?"
"Perhaps he expected to announce this weeks ago, to line up with when he said to expect the short burn of the century, but something delayed that announcement."
Elon sticking it to the shorts. Ha!
"Maybe it is what he meant, but the real short burn of the century would still be VW, which traded at 5x market cap for a bit.

Edit: adding source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze"
It is and it feels good! 
VW
Ask a Gunner?
"But wouldn't taking it private at an all-time high also be *considerably* costlier??

I kind of like the idea of them going private because the market is just so ridiculously fickle, but at the same time buying up all those shares has been take an enormous amount of money out of the company's coffers, no?  

What am I missing?"
Can someone explain to me what short burn means? I know Elon has been tweeting about it and stuff but in economic terms what does it mean? 
It's still underpriced padawan.
"If Tesla goes private, public Tesla shares are taken off the market.

At that point, the shorts have to cover and realize a (massive [$12.6 billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-shorts-stand-their-ground-after-1-7-billion-loss-thursday-1533288601)) loss.  I'm assuming you can't short a private Tesla fund, so the shorts have no way to get back into their position.  Losses would be locked in and permanent.

This makes me love Tesla and Elon even more. Well played, Elon. Well played.

I'm assuming shareholders are mostly rational and will vote for the company going private : D"
">if he takes the company private at an all time high stock price,

It sure doesn't look like that's going to happen"
Thinking that this could violate SEC rules perhaps?
Nice.
Or just the start of a Ponzi scheme
"Achieving an all time stock price of $420 would be the SHORT BURN OF THE CENTURY.  Then taking it private wouldn't really make any difference except preventing them from trying again.  What taking it private does is produce the LONG BURN OF THE MILLENNIUM.  Everyone that's been the faithful, hanging in there since IPO, gets fucked out of their shares that could have potentially been worth over $2000 in a few years. "
"Former securities lawyer and current hedgie: the answer is probably. As others have said, he absolutely cannot trade around it. Another thing is that he has to have a reasonable expectation that this is true. In other words, if he doesn’t have this whole thing o9% buttoned up, he will get sued for securities fraud in a civil court. If he’s really full of shit there could be criminal charges. 

That said, tweeting this prior to tactical execution of the deal is monumentally fucking stupid. Normal companies never, never, never do this bc it dramatically complicates the deal structuring and execution. "
"As long as there were no trades for himself, or any other insiders that knew he would announce that he was ""thinking about it"", there is no law against it. Happens all the time. Rumors, people saying things like, ""yes, acquiring this company is something we would consider"". Although they usually don't because it would make the company more expensive to take private.

But also, it seems like that might be the goal. The Saudi fund just made public that they own just under 5%, which is when you have to publicly declare to the SEC your holdings. This usually happens when there is an attempt at a hostile takeover. What Elon did was brilliant and he just countered it by tweeting this out. He is willing to take it private at the $420 price, probably way higher than the Saudi's were planning on. So now it'll be a race to see who can obtain >50% of the shares. Elon has a massive head start with how much he owns already, but the Saudi's fund is ridiculously huge right now ($250B) and I'm sure they have the ability to pull in another few hundred billion on demand. Kind of scary. Elon will need to find a stupid amount of capital and fast to do this. 

It's very smart on Saudi Fund's part... They would own the worlds largest solar, battery, and EV producer. They could cover a desert in panels and sell the cars and batteries across Europe/Asia, while providing the power as well. They would once again have the largest control of the world's energy. "
I would love to see this question answered.
"I believe since its public its fair game. He didn't share it with a certain person and not others.

He made a statement... what you choose to do with it or not do with it is your business."
"Public statements, even wild speculation, is totally allowed. Even something like saying they'd hit 5k Model 3s a week is ""wild speculation"". There are many reasons why the stock will never be $420, just like there are many that could have prevented 5k cars a week. "
"Maybe his twitter was hacked and this is the clever idea to capitalize on it.

Seems super weird to me too."
"He's a private citizen and can make any statement he likes.  However, he's also the CEO of a publicly traded company and I don't think this would have been cleared by his legal department.  Normally this sort of thing is released in an extremely carefully worded press release.

He probably won't get in trouble unless he's making shit up, but he could open himself up to lawsuits and SEC investigations.  Also, I'm pretty sure his legal team is mad at him right now."
"If he doesn't actually have the funding secured, then he made a material misstatement to investors that he knew was false. The misstatement inflated the value of Tesla securities, and the corrective disclosure will bring the price back down. 

That is the definition of securities fraud."
"Yes.

However one reason CEOs are usually very careful is because you don't necessarily have to prove insider trading, you have to prove it looks like insider trading.

So if he has a family member/friend that benefits from his statement impacting the stock price they are at risk of being charged with insider trading.  Then they would have to prove they weren't aware he was going to make the statement.

"
"I believe yes, provided it’s all actually true - that is, he has serious intentions of going private *and* has already secured funding. If either of those are false, I imagine the SEC will have a look into it (now, I imagine they’ll have a look into it anyway, but we both know what I meant).

With that being said, Tesla’s shareholders still have to approve. They can reject it - it’d be kind of stupid to, considering how much the stock price rose on this news - but they can."
"That's an excellent question. I'm no expert, but if I owned Tesla shares I'd actually be pretty nervous. About 6 months ago I bailed. I've been in and out of TSLA since just before the model S came out. I've probably made enough to buy one, but I think I'm glad I'm out.

I think."
Yes.
In general it seems like it is okay: https://www.goodwinlaw.com/publications/2013/04/sec-clarifies-social-media-use-and-reg-fd-compliance
According to the [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2013-2013-51htm) it is. 
https://www.tesla.com/blog/taking-tesla-private
hes been making sketchy posts for years. they are all of questionable legality.
"This would demolish shorts, they'd lose 13 billion dollars unless they get out fast - and that would just force the price over $420 in a hurry anyway as they all rush to cover."
"This would be the short burn of the century, as the foretold by the prophesy.  "
Someone care to ELI5?
"You mean, he caused?  With this tweet. "
"Essentially, Elon and a group of investors buy out public shareholders at X amount ($420). 

Tesla goes private. 

Usually done to take time to restructure debt/operations. They can go public again after the fact...But Elon's made it known he HATES running a public company. So i'm not sure if this would happen or not.

Would be interesting. Could be a reason why TSLA is spiking. "
The ability to do this came from all of the ETH money he made via Twitter.
"It's clear there are people who want Tesla to fail. As long as Tesla is a public traded company, news articles, investor recommendations, short interest, etc. can be used to try to hurt the company. Elon has shown in the past that he is sick of all FUD thrown by parties interested in hurting Tesla. 

Elon also believes Tesla will succeed, so if he and a few other investors can buy all the stock and reap all the reward that's good for them. 

The main thing that would be interesting to see is if Tesla went private, would most of the FUD dry up since they no longer have financial incentive to spread it?

I'm also curious if this is the catalyst to the short squeeze that he mentioned months ago..."
[Investopedia - Public to Private](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/publictoprivate.asp)
"Musk buys all the outstanding shares in the company that he doesn't already own, essentially.

edit: Which also means he or his small group of investors/shareholders make 100% of the decisions AND (aaaaand...) they don't have to disclose a lot of financial detail about the company.... if I recall correctly.

edit 2: AND there are no shares out there to short anymore."
"It means they wouldn't have to change their clothes in public every 3 months or face public pressure to secure profits \*now.\* Private investors often have high expectations for profit as well though, but one imagines that the investors here are friendlies and are aligned with a longer term approach if they would be willing to do it.   


To others' comments, there wouldn't be short selling any more either, though there are still a lot of entrenched players / industries who would prefer to maintain the status quo of pumping internal combustion engine cars full of petroleum based fuels. "
"The reason why they don't want it public is simple, Tesla has the largest amount of short sellers and they made it a business to make a circus out of every news trying to bring the stock price down. 

https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2018/04/15/tesla-has-the-largest-short-position-of-any-stock-followed-by-the-faangs/#2c695a0e1573

It's a nightmare to have the spotlight on them 24/7/365 and it's not like everything gets reported fairly, they speculate on any insane BS trying to cook up some dirt. Every day of the week is like a new scandal."
"> Why would he take it private if things are going well enough?

If a company is making tons of money you have no reason to take it public. Just do more of that money making stuff. Tell wall street leaches to get fucked.

You take a company public at the point where it needs money to grow and needs scale to become profitable. Wall St banks will help a company go public if they have a business plan that could eventually lead to profitability. That's where Tesla was in 2010 as they turned to public financing to build assembly & production for the Model S.

Now Tesla is at the point where it will probably be profitable on an operating basis for the foreseeable future. CapEx needs can be met on an ongoing basis and through traditional borrowing. 

TSLA is/was probably the cheapest it will ever be right now, so if you are going to buy it out and take it private now is the time. Otherwise its share price rising mainly benefits shareholders like me. Personally as a long shareholder I was planning to hold part of my position above $420."
"He just published a blog post answering some of your questions, but essentially the goal would be to run the company in a way that optimizes best for the long game rather than quarterly targets and having your company's value be prey to market sentiment."
">Most importantly WHERE did he get the money from???

CHYYYYYYYNA"
Can someone also ELI5 what that would mean for employees? Do they also need to sell back their vested RSUs and what happens to the RSUs that are currently vesting? 
Trading has been suspended
"IMO because when you run a public company you are obligated to the shareholders.  Every move elon makes whether good or bad affects the value of the company, he gets criticized for this or that etc.  taking it private means he doesn't owe anyone any explanation for anything he does.  He could publicly become a racist for all he cares and no one really could call for his removal.  So basically he can;t really be punished for anything he really does, on the downside though he is 100% responsible for the success of the company and its debts etc."
https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/blog/taking-tesla-private
"Middle Eastern investors - oil money. 

Go private - can take care of the accounting shenanigans without public disclosure and circumvent SOX. "
He won't and can't. They don't have the money to do it. 
"He's made it clear he doesn't like it being public. He has to answer to the shareholders which are often looking for short term profits. IF he got the money he could run it the way he wants, which is probably break even full growth mode, showing no real profits for years

Publicly traded companies also have to comply to a ton of specific financial reporting rules which are very onerous. Sorbanes Oxley is the biggest. It's a hassle for a guy who likes to move fast"
"China? 
  
seriously, going private means they weren't going to meet their bond requirements.   
  
edit : Saudi Arabia!!!  talk about a pivot!"
"If tesla went private, they would no longer have short-sellers hounding their PR with fake doom stories every week. The short sellers would be gone and all they would have to deal with is the fifth column operatives in social media from the other big automakers spreading doom stories every week."
"A CEO and major shareholder can't say things like this, no matter how true they might be.  If it doesn't happen, a class action suit will certainly follow, and possibly SEC action against Tesla and/or Musk."
"Some of what it means for the company is that:

- they can operate with less admin/overhead/compliance costs because they are not longer listed

- they no longer have to deal with BS from shorts/news agencies/conference calls/etc

- No longer have access to public share offerings as a form of financing

- stock option compensation wont really be a thing like it is currently"
"It's means SEC lawsuits, that's the only certainty right now"
"Means he's going corporate shell game/Ponzi scheme. Just like Trump, you either buy the bullshit or wait for it to dieoff."

But it's sooner.
"I feel you, I wanted 1 more 0.  I invested expecting the apple evaluation of 4200 a share."
"Yep, was planning on holding for decades."
"Yep, check out the stock price. I'm not sure the legality of saying this on twitter, seems weird to me too."
Yes... that's a strategy hedge funds commonly employ. Basically you're betting on whether or not this will go through. If it doesn't then you lose money. 
"Definitely don't buy it now, Tesla fluctuates between 290/300 - 370 on a fairly regular basis (monthly), so I'd say wait for it to drop, (320 or lower), which it will, and then decide from there.

To me, this just seems like Elon being Elon, but Tesla is a very easy stock to play if you're patient."
"Yes you can buy it now. 

But it's not selling for $420 because the market is predicting that there's a decent chance (12% or so) that this will never happen.  

As more credible plans come out then that's when you'll see the price starting to approach $420. "
That's not it works. He has to offer an incentive for people to sell. Otherwise he would never get the 50.1% he needs for a vote
"There is a strong chance it will no go through. Shares do this a lot, proposed takeover = share jump, takeover falls through = shares collapse.

The current price factors in the risk Vs reward. Very promising take overs trade within a couple of % below offer price"
He's bluffing. And he needs to quit tweeting. He's starting to sound crazy like Trump. 
This is no guarantee. Musk has said a lot of things that ended up not happening the way he thought they would. 
"Seems like it. Here's another comment I saw on the topic:

>The Saudi fund just made public that they own just under 5%, which is when you have to publicly declare to the SEC your holdings. This usually happens when there is an attempt at a hostile takeover.

"In order to drop this tweet, he needed to have $72B in non-Saudi money lined up. So $14B he personally owns at $420 valuation, then he has about the same in SpaceX he could potentially borrow against or bring over. Still missing $50B. So Apple, Google, China?"
"> Prince Mohammed's 2030 vision? 


Don’t forget Mohammed bin Salman’s vision includes the current genocide Saudi Arabia is conducting in Yemen (which he spearheaded as Defense Minister), torturing Saudi officials to death, and arresting women rights activists for supporting progressive policy he claims to support. "
[deleted]
I'm out of the loop and extremely dumb. What is Prince Mohammed's 2030 vision?
[deleted]
good point. TSLA is just getting started
"This would be nice, but I don't think it'd happen.  Though Elon has apparently considered something like this for SpaceX, I think there are rules about # of owning entities (500?) in a private company.

*Edit:
> The US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, section 12(g), generally limits a privately held company to fewer than 500 shareholders. The assumption has been that companies with 500 investors are quasi-public anyway, and for disclosure and other reasons should be forced to go public when the shareholder number approaches this limit."
GOOGL did that but it's still subject to the quarter to quarter whims of stock traders who can vote with their wallets. 
No. He would lose lot of the advantages of being a private company if there were any type of shares that were publicly traded. He would have a lot of expense and would have to disclose financial information.

"Elon would be more than happy to have you fund his Kickstarter project.  Put a deposit on a Tesla Semi or just mail him cash, it all goes in the same bin."
I would be sad that I can't participate in the gigantic upside of the company. He hates being public though
"As someone who has invested and accumulated shares since the IPO, this makes me sad as well.  Don’t get me wrong, financially I’ll be doing really well, but I love knowing that I own a piece of this company that I’m so passionate about.   I felt like I could share in its success and support it in its failures.

I realize that I shouldn’t get emotionally attached to an investment, but it’s too late now.  :-(

Edit. Elon just Tweeted

“My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if we’re private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity’s SpaceX investment.”  [-Tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1026890900885184514?s=21)

So, there may be a path forward to still own a part of Tesla even if they go private. I don’t even know what that means, to be honest. 
"
"100% agree.  Tesla has always been my retirement plan.  I'd be happy to make a chunk at $420, but it's not fuck you money yet."
Dread it.
Wtf? Why would this news make you sad as a shareholder?
What do you guys have against shorts? It's not like shorting a stock harms it
Please explain to me why you would be willing to take a huge personal  loss just so some people who in fact had no effect on the company's liquidity or the stock price would lose money.  
Yup
"Unless I misunderstand, then shorts could just exit at the current price? Why would they hold until the sale?  Is trading frozen during the delisting vote?"
Unless you cover now for a discount at $380. Shorts rushing to cover could push the price higher than $420 before this even happens...
ELI5 what is short ?
Oh no! What ever will happen to THEM!?!? 😢😢
"He didn't apologise to shorts, he apologised to investors.

"
"That's more public and instantly visible than if Tesla added an update to their investor relations page, the gray area is that they are notifying of something they are ""considering"" whereas other big public companies might not announce publicly until they had a deal in place.  "
"He has to announce it at some point. I believe he is very serious about this plan. Being the most shorted stock in history has to be very demoralizing for his team. And it would be extremely satisfying to ruin those shorts of the people who have been betting against him.

If this works then the next time he goes public, people will hesistate to short the stock because he might go through the same plan again.

Edit: Also seems there is a saudi fund that is trying to buy up shares in Tesla. So Musk wants to force the company back to private to remove investors voting rights and stop the Saudis potentially influencing the company in the future."
">"" My hope is \*all\* current investors remain with Tesla even if we’re private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity’s SpaceX investment. ""

Can anyone explain this to me? 

It is my understanding that the SEC usually has a limit on the amount of investors in a company and requires them to be high networth, so just anyone can't jump in and invest $2500. Is this something special or is Musk just overstating the same system. Like ""sure anyone can invest $100,000 using the fidelity fund"""
"Cant they go private, but leave the option for current investors to remain shareholders, but just lose thier voting rights?"
"You can keep it. No forced sales, just no public trading."
https://i.imgur.com/XS5LK.gif
"Buy them back, except the small loss, but you get to add to thwm in future."
"If true believers want to get in, they need to get in now or forever hold their peace.

Short burn of the century indeed."

Thank you. I was getting really emotional 
"Agree but ""of the century"" seems unlikely.  
These wall st shorters don't seem to learn much.  And with economies growing so fast, I'd bet there will be worse burnings in the next 82yrs."
The man needs to peace out 
[deleted]
You can still be a part of it. Buy in/out every six months. 
"Can't believe I had to scroll this far down to find this. Absolutely right. As a public company, Tesla must be able to set and meet expectations. They have been atrocious at doing this. But it's a fine way to operate as a private company. Here's hoping it goes through."
"I totally agree. The huge short position that has been against Tesla has only been hurting the company and is a threat to it in the long term. This is going to happen because it has to.

Edit: shorts downvoting me eh? How you like them shorts?"
Well i guess you don't start bidding your max when you want something right?
Unless he already has enough shares locked up behind the scenes at $420 that it doesn't matter. Can they just force a sale at $420 even if the stock is higher?
"Same, this actually quite sad "
Buy a car?
[deleted]
You don't think Elon would like to not have to deal with being a public company in general?
"Would that be stock manipulation, if he doesn't go through with it? To be clear I have a model 3, own shares, not trying to spread FUD :)"
"If he is doing this to spite the shooters then the company is doomed being run by a guy who is not doing what’s in the best interest of the current shareholders. 

He would do this so he doesn’t have to deal with reporting to the public how the company is doing and there is less regulatory oversight. "
He's been talking about this for years
[deleted]
"my understanding is that if it's a lie, then he could get in trouble, but it doesn't necessarily have to actually happen as long as it's not for the sole purpose of manipulating the price."
[deleted]
Gives Musk the ability to quickly walk away putting blame on someone else... not sure I would get that excited. I would be more concerned with someone whose entire economy and world value is in a product this company is designed to replace. I would expect innovation to slow.
"If this goes through, you can:

* Have your shares bought for $420 when it goes private.

* Keep them and be able to sell every ~6 months during liquidity evens a la SpaceX (both shareholders and employees according to Tesla press release).

* Sell them when it eventually goes public again some time later.
"
"Same.  If this pans out as it seems it will, retail investors like us will have the option to either cash out, or retain investment in ""a private Tesla"".  In the latter case, we can buy or sell fractional ownership every ~6mo.  

So, for my kid's investment, I'll hold the private investment.  If I can, add to it at intervals.  "
"Technically you can still invest in private companies, you just have to be wealthy enough.

SpaceX is a nice example."
"Yeah, it kinda tweaks me a bit that retail investors (and a large part of the institutional investors via holdings for 401Ks) who financed the company through a lot of the riskiest periods would be cut out from the (IMO likely) upside as Tesla is getting close to ""out of the woods""."
"That’s totally why, but we’re short on details how. "
Might be last chance ever 
Better load up now before they go private.
"That was my first reaction, but then I stopped and thought about it.  This is Elon Musk we're talking about, he does crazy things."
100% serious. He is capable and that takes a lot of pressure off him. 
"Must be serious otherwise it's market manipulation by the CEO of a publicly traded company, and the SEC may have something to say about that."
There was this letter he sent out the SpaceX employees a few years ago explaining why he doesn’t want to take it public. You could tell reading between the lines in that letter he was basically wishing in the back of his mind that Tesla wasn’t traded publicly. I think he’s serious about this. He hates having to work around “quarterly performance metrics”.
Why?
You're smoking if you think it'll be anything other than $420.
It's not a question
[deleted]
If Tesla turns a profit in q3/4 the valuation will probably push up to near 100bil.. they can get full control of company and make all the $$ 
"Not even close, Koch brothers are both worth ~60bil and their company is private."
What about Saudi Aramco and Gazprom?
"Uber isnt the most valuable private company. Its the most valuable start-up (ie not yet exited). Tesla has already exited (gone public), and is therefore not a startup for the purposes of that ranking."
I'm interested to
they probably feel the volitility is causing all the negative news. As its been pumped by the shorts. 
Pretty much. 
"I guess you can buy back again if you're still long. Forget the brokerage fees, they're a sunk cost now"
"The stock will dip again, don't worry."
I can’t wait for all the hot takes!
I’d like to know too. Do they expire worthless?

"Unless they think that this is Elon's last gasp before bankruptcy, the deal will fall through, and Tesla will cease to exist before the end of the year.

IMHO that is a dumb position to take, but trolling SeekingAlpha, that seems to be the consensus."
Just a discount to the risk that the deal would not come through. If all works out it will slowly inch toward 400. 
"> Why didn’t shorts cover today?

Denial of reality, but also inability to cover: there's quite likely not 34 million holders of shares willing to sell at lower than $420.

> They now know the stock is going to 420. And price cheaper than that is better for them.

For retail shorts the ""trading losses are not real until they are realized"" delusion is powerful.

Big shorts probably *cannot* cover - it would mean realizing *huge* losses.

So they are hoping for a miracle (such as this being a joke, or shareholders not approving it) - it's possibly bankruptcy otherwise.

$1000 is my target also!  
Exactly!
That happened before the tweet. 2 Billion dollar buy from a Saudi group
It is legal if it is true. 
This might be why it is halted.
"In that case it would be incredibly illegal and very short-sighted.  Elon knows the rules so no, I think this is real."
$420 is not meant to make you happy. Its meant to dump a truck load of shit on shorters and extinguish their souls. But unfortunately that means there will be innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire.
"Did you read the press release?  Musk stated those that want to continue to stay invested can continue to do so.  

For those of us that are long term; this is great!  Long term private investing usually has much higher returns than public trading which is controlled by massive institutional investors.  And when Tesla does go public again expect a huge return."
"Agree

Those of us that supported the company from the beginning are basically being shafted by wealthy billionaires. We stayed put through the hard times. Even increased our portfolio, and once the path to profitability is an (almost) sure thing? The ultra wealthy wants to swoop in and collect the upside over the next couple of years.

Pardon my French but... Fuck those guys"
"It's better. Also for Elon's health. The shorting will be gone and most of the media crazyness will be gone with it.

I would love to own Tesla stock for a way longer period of time, but this is just better for him."
Same here. Bummed that we may not be a part of that
Toys R Us paid more than double the market value per share when they went from public to private. Shareholders are typically compensated well for being forcefully delisted by this process.
They choose an amount that would get 51% of the shareholders to agree.  There is lots of research that goes into it.
Buy ROPE
Cry
1-800-273-8255
1-800-273-8255
Just Elon announcing this had probably cost him a ton of money and could possibly trigger a short squeeze. Not sure if there could be any legal implications if this doesn’t happen due to the market manipulation by announcing this. 
Yep! A little bit of politics on Elon's part... this is his way of saying that $420 IS a low price
Each share of stock gets you a vote. So he could have a collection of large shareholders to get him above 50% already.
basically 1 stock = 1 vote. So if you have 25% of the stock you have 25% of the vote. 
"I’m over from r/SpaceX and I don’t pay that much attention to Tesla, but from our experience private is what has allowed SpaceX to innovate at the level they do. Elon knows this and we know this. Excited for the future of Tesla even though I’m not interested in cars :)"
"As in to tweet it and not have serious intentions to go ahead with it? That's a securities fraud and a huge crime. But even with Elons crazy Twitter moments, he's not that stupid. He seems to be pretty serious about it as well. "
"Saw on Twitter l, long calls are way down"
I dunno - but I guess it sucks to be them.
"Yes. If this is real, then the shorts are screwed big time. "
">Could the price actually skyrocket past 420

Theoretically, sure, but there's a massive resistance as the open market price approaches the offer price.

The vast majority of investors who would otherwise take payment from the offer would prefer to sell at 420 before the offer closes - it's free money that can immediately be put in other investments, and it's 100% risk free immediate money while the financed private deal always has at least \*some\* risk of falling apart until the final signature hits the paper.

As you can imagine, each tiny tick above the offer price increasingly adds massive incentive to sell immediately on the open market.

While in theory it's possible for investors to hold their stocks even past 420 to profit from the fixed short demand, there's sort of a game theory effect that's inevitably going to kick off. This only works is if nobody cashes out as the price passes 420, and no sane investor is going to trade an immediate, risk free payment of the offer price in exchange for a small increase in profit at a future date, along with a big helping of risk."
"See I think Spiegel is wrong here:

[https://twitter.com/markbspiegel/status/1026914473955737600](https://twitter.com/markbspiegel/status/1026914473955737600)

The risk isn't $60. Why would someone sell you shares at $420? They already have a buyer at $420."
"> How does this effect those are holding shorts?

Badly."
"They would probably be crying in a corner after what happened when the tweets came out. Yeesh...i heard over 1 billion lost on paper. If the stock does get to $420, that would be close to over 4 billion dollars lost this year alone for shorts. I don’t feel bad at all. You have to be a complete moron to bet against Elon. "
"As I understood, if 50%+1 of shareholders accept that price, then yes, you will be forced to give them up for designated price."
https://www.tesla.com/blog/taking-tesla-private?redirect=no
"(I am not an expert.)

The way I see it  is that you would firstly need a person who is an investor to lend you those shares for shorting.

If Tesla goes private, it means that those shares are no longer publicly available, so short sellers suddenly don't have any access to shares unless they buy their stake in.  
And I don't really understand, why would somebody, who has a stake in private company, lend any shares whatsoever to outside party."
"He gets to advertise a 20% Premium, and won't be paying much over market by the time it happens. Genius!"
"You would still own equity in the company, but yes it would be harder to liquidate and assess true value"
"They always forget about Elon time, but Elon time is **damn** accurate."
The only problem Tesla has is outside influence of Oil Money through the stock market
Maybe Alphabet 
"Softbank and the Saudi sovereign wealth fund are more likely, I think."
I get the gut feeling you hold a short position on TSLA.
Because news was released about Saudi investors buying a $2 billion dollar stake earlier.
[https://new.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/95d45s/saudi\_arabias\_sovereign\_wealth\_fund\_builds\_2bn/](https://new.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/95d45s/saudi_arabias_sovereign_wealth_fund_builds_2bn/)
News of $2B Saudi investment broke shortly before. That is why it jumped before the tweet.
"How would he do *anything* if he wasn't allowed to make decisions that impact the paper value of his shares.

The main thing is that he has to plan his trades enough in advance that he can't profit off of short term swings he could predict with his inside knowledge."

"Elon just tweeted ""My hope is \*all\* current investors remain with Tesla even if we’re  private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with  Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity’s SpaceX investment."""
I don't think so.
How much do you own?
You don't need institutional investors if you're going private.
Why? Wouldn't they cash out with a nice profit?
"Secured just means the money is available. TSLA is a public company, if this tweet is serious and goes through (it will not IMO) then it will be a private company like SpaceX. "

"He still holds 20% of Tesla, even if they go private."
"No, he'd be part of the group buying the shares so he'd get at least 20% I would think."
"No. Not unless he plans to own less of the private company and it doesn't seem like he would want that.

The person(s) taking the company private will have to pony up the funds to buy out everyone's shares, unless they are owned by someone who is planning to be an owner in the private company. "
depends on the agreement he made with whoever is funding I guess. He could take a stake in the acquiring fund for example. 
There is still a risk of it not going through. Hence a premium. 
I believe NASDAQ decides when to hault the stock. A reporter just tweeted that the SEC declined to comment about whether Elon broke any rules with his announcement. 
"Well, for the shorts it means that 1-800-273-8255 is gonna get a whole lot of calls."
"Well, for the shorts it means that 1-800-273-8255 is gonna get a whole lot of calls."
"I can imagine, and I hope the SEC doesn't care."
"As far as I know you can hold on to your shares, but they'd become part of a private fund. Or you can sell (at the new price of $420) and use your profits to buy a trip to space on Falcon-9."
"Would be considered a change of control, and all unvested shares would vest and be tendered at the $420 amount."
Depends on what they decide to do but I would be fairly sure they won't screw their employees. They could  switch them to private shares on the same vesting schedule or vest them immediately. 
I don’t think that’s why he did this plan. I think that was the day he realized that Tesla’s stock is not dependent on Tesla’s performance as it should be. And he basically fuck this we’re out till y’all can get your act together. 
"> Have the Shorts started to cover yet? 

Kinda hard to buy back shares when trading is closed."
Dell went private a couple years ago and they are doing fine. As Elon described it really does make it easier to run a company when you aren't trying to meet quarterly Wall Street expectations.
"> But where is the funding coming from?

My guesses:

- the Saudis who, according to a report in the FT today, recently acquired a 3-5% stake in Tesla?
- Elon is friends with ‎the two Google founders, Larry Page‎ and ‎Sergey Brin. [""LARRY PAGE: I Would Rather Give My Billions To Elon Musk Than Charity""](https://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-elon-musk-2014-3).
- [""Page and fellow Google cofounder Sergey Brin sometimes meet with Musk to talk about technology, transportation, and more in this private location, Vance writes.""](https://www.businessinsider.com/googles-secret-apartment-elon-musk-2015-5)

"
"People who own shares will be given an option. $420/share or continue. If they take the cash they walk. If they continue their shares will disappear and be replaced by ownership in some new private mutual fund. The details of that aren't clear. Other than that nothing much will change for them. But the public will stop getting a lot of info as only shareholders in the new private company will be privy to Tesla's info

Dyson is a well known private company for example "
"Yes, that is arbitrage theory. That is why the stock is going up. Every share would net the delta between buy price and $420, you decide what makes a difference in your life. "
Well he's done well so far!
Tesla would be taken off the stock exchange
If you want to keep your shares they will be exchanged to a new type that you will have the option to sell twice per year. Tesla will have the right of first refusal on a sale.
Shorts would be forced to close their short positions - which means buying stock on the open market at the current (elevated prices) and making their paper losses real.   
"He royal hoses the shorters, the short burn of the century, because it's hard to imagine any scenario where they aren't forced to close the position, and close it at near all-time highs if not an all-time high.  This is a nuclear bomb on the shorts, which is almost the most fun thing about it. hahah.  

It's freaking hilarious!!!!  They're majorly freaking out and they probably don't know what sort of dirty trick to play to improve their situation."
"You totally don't have to sell.  You can keep ownership.  Elon wants you to stay on.  As for benefits to Tesla, one it mentioned was that there will no longer be huge financial incentives for random players to sabotage the company either via a messaging program or actual sabotage .  

Right now, a lot of people are desperate for the stock to go down, because they sold it short, meaning they sold someone else's stock promising to buy it back in the future (and they of course want to buy it back at a lower price).

 "
"From a stock perspective, it will be more difficult to buy and sell. There will probably be designated times where one would be allowed to buy and sell stock. VS on the public markets, one can buy and sell anytime you wish (while the markets are open and trading of course). "
"Probably.  The pension likely has rules on the categories of investments they can hold.  If Tesla isn't permissible in its private form, they'll just take the buyout offer."
"This should be its own discussion as well as what the terms of the funding is.  It could be debt secured on Musk's SpaceX assets for him to purchase the shares personally of anyone that wants to sell.  It could be someone wanting to buy the shares outright.

If no one wants to sell, the investor invests nothing.  If everyone wants to sell, it could be something like a $50 bln investment.  Musk wants people to hold their position."
He is obligated to consider all options.  Going private is not that uncommon and consideration of it is extremely common. And stock manipulation? The shorts push out FUD on a daily basis
How? Provide a link to show what he did is illegal. Your opinion does not make it so. 
He has a history of following through on his jokes though
[deleted]
"If he’s not serious, it’s likely illegal stock manipulation. 

So I sure hope he’s serious. "
How is it a obvious weed joke? Because of the number 420? It’s $420. You are only making it into a weed joke because you want to. 
"how did he pump the stock ? if you take it private you HAVE to disclose the price at which you are giving the tender offer. So he made the disclosure today. How is that different from any other day ? He would probably have been better off doing it after q1 or q2 when outlook was more bleak, but I guess not many investors would be interesting in providing the capital then. "
"I know bud, it's coming. "
"You are guessing - don't state things as facts when you can't possibly know the outcome.   Yes you could be right or you could be completely wrong.     

Tesla is a highly speculative stock and you should not be encouraging people to invest money that they can't afford to lose with suggestions that any money invested in Tesla is a sure thing.  It isn't.
"
"You were probably banned for giving investment advice, which this comment sounds like "
you were about a year early on the short squeeze predictions. But it’s really happening now. 
"I think Apple is way past the point where anybody could raise enough money to take it private. Even if they did, a trillion dollar deal would be so big that just moving the money around the financial system would cause huge ripples. "

Either way is good. Sell at 420 get money now. In 10 years Tesla will be much bigger than it is now.

If you don’t own any stock at the moment, you won’t be able to on your own once they go private.

You'll be able to convert them to private shares.
You better diversify dude; having all of your eggs in the same basket is a recipe for disaster.
Of course he is serious. Why would he jeopardize himself and the company? I don’t think he is THAT dumb. 
"Or he will actually do it and force the shorts to cover at $420.

I bet there is lots of pants shitting going on in shortsville while trading is suspended."
"You have no idea what you're talking about.

As is, he may have broken the law today with just this tweet. If, he actually did it for the reason you are listing, he has clearly broken numerous laws and is fucked.
"
TSLA trading suspended. I think it's happening.
Yea that's completely against the law
Funny because to me it’s just a number.

"All we have to look into Teslas past went Tesla went almost bankrupt back in 2013

https://www.fastcompany.com/3045239/google-almost-bought-a-near-bankrupt-tesla-in-2013

Larry Page almost bought the company. I wouldn't be surprised if Google is involved even if its only 20-30%. No way Apple has anything to do with this. "
No. 20% Premium over the stock price post Q2 earnings call (which had already gone up 16%)
That.... is not how this works
What you’re suggesting is illegal 
"I might be wrong, but Tesla isn't going to make any money from the stock unless either they issue new stock, or sell off some company owned shares"
"pretty sure that would be market manipulation and would be illegal. besides, it wouldn't work since the cash isn't going to tesla directly, it does nothing except raise the market cap."
"It would raise the company's valuation and Musk's net worth, but it wouldn't affect the company's operating cash."
You do realize that an increased stock price didn't equate to cash for Tesla
"And go to federal prison for stock manipulation!

I think he's got to do this now, and even then, might still be in some hot water with the SEC."
"No...

That would be how Elon winds up in front of a court room full of the lawyers of the lawyers for a bunch of old rich people who were manipulated into investing.

Do not fuck with old rich people and their money. Old money will burn anything to the ground to send a message."
That's fraud
"With the current news, what do you think now? Do you think I deserve the down votes??? It looks like the price will exceed $420 as Tesla goes private. This move has brought Tesla a major investor injection of cash. Eat it shorts."
[deleted]
It would inflate whenever you announced it.  
"Possibly short squeeze, then the stock returns to normal price after a while then he purchases?"
"yeah they could just start to repurchase on the open market any day with a limited group of their finance people and external brokers seeing it until the amount got to be big enough to really notice.  Most big companies repurchase shares regularly.  I feel like this is intended to cause a share spike and force a short squeeze, just a more effective move than musk's 3 weeks til positions explode tweet"
"Umm, I wanna call you a dumbass.... but I don't want to get in trouble.  You can't take a company private in secrete.  You literally have to make it public."
So?
Hahaha ok buddy
Umm please no ... imagine Tim Cook telling Elon what to do next ... No thanks
"Apple should not outright buy Tesla but rather buy a stake in Tesla. It absolutely makes sense looking into the future for both companies. Somewhere along the lines of a 10% stake. I would be surprised if they were not involved somewhat in the so called “secured funding” that Elon mentioned on twitter, especially considering how much cash Apple has in the bank. "
"Apple makes shitty customers, while Elon is making a better future. Good luck with your thinking"
SEC have already said it is not manipulation and it cab only be fraud if people can prove he never considered it.
what ? He is LITERALLY obligated to disclose the $ per share before they place a shareholder vote. So why the F is today different than any other day ?
"The shareholders are his partners.  It's the anti-shareholders, the shorts, that can cause problems, because they have an interest in creating messages that hurt the stock."
"The shareholders aren't getting fucked.  They *have* to (at least in aggregate) agree to this for it to happen, so they'll be made a pretty sweet offer."
Lol. Troll
Only if he’s lying
TSLA trading suspended
You know one can keep their shares when they go private right? You have that option. Look at his other tweets. 
I work for a once-public company that has gone private years ago.... so let's just agree to disagree.
"lol yes, liquidate shares now at $367(if trading was still going on).....or hold and sell at $420....

hhmmm, logic....  


Not to mention, no confirmation Saudi's are 'buying Tesla'. They bought a 5% stake in the company, via purchasing shares over the market and NOT from Tesla.   


Tesla just had their Q2 earnings call. They have plenty of cash for the time being...so this ""burning so much cash they are insolvent"" rhetoric is 100% WRONG.   


After the latest earnings call, Tesla COULD EASILY do another capital raise and get funds. They are sticking to their word about not raising funds yet or diluting shares doing it....Bankruptcy isn't in immediate term. Elon could also float Tesla quite awhile just selling a small chunk of SpaceX shares too. Especially considering the value of SpaceX going up and up, the longer he would hold off doing that, the less he has to sell to keep Tesla afloat.

It happens literally everyday. Zillow was just halted yesterday. Amazon and Google were halted earlier this year.
It happens when volatility in a stock is too high. It's done to shield the economy against knee-jerk collapse.
There are several things that can cause a stock to be halted ([https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=tradehaltcodes](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=tradehaltcodes)) in this case it was a T1. I \*think\* because of Fair Disclosure ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation\_Fair\_Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_Fair_Disclosure)). It went from T1 to T3 after the public release of the email sent to employees and a few minutes later opened back up for trading.
Jeff who?
"Saudis, Softbank etc. There is money out there if he is serious."
Larry Ellison (exec @ Oracle) always talks about how he's bff with Elon and that Tesla isn't going anywhere. 
"Ah yes, arguably Tesla's largest competitor: Google...That would be a wise investment from Larry Page."
"If Elon could tap Larry again to buy Tesla, maybe Google for the first time in history becomes good at building consumer hardware."
I don't think they like him 
Wasn’t the fruit company planning on investing in self driving cars?
20-24% I think.
he cant it would be a crime.
"If he was joking he is going to get hit with some serious securities fraud lawsuits and criminal investigations. 

You can’t just go around disclosing false material information. "
And he doesn't need 100% usually you go for 51-54% and you're good.
Uncle Warren is a risk averse pussy
"Maybe if Tesla were a cigar on the side of the road with a couple puffs left..  

But for real warren doesn't like owning more than 9%^(?) of a company."
"Tesla just feels so similiar to Apple - Complete HW/SW control, Coolnees factor, fanboyism etc. Would be a good match. However I cant imagine Elon working under Apple."
"Apple would be an interesting buyer. But it's not Apple's style to buy large companies. They prefer to buy smaller companies for talent or for a fairly well-defined, small product a la the AirPort routers back in the day."

"> This would likely be a deal with private equity firms and a portion would certainly be funded by debt.

That is a massive investment for virtually any PE shop.  The other issue is they wouldn't be able to leverage the company up much more than it already is - the company's existing debt is already trading well below par and the company has horrible operating metrics.  The FED goes apeshit if banks fund deals over 7x EBITDA, and I think Tesla's EBITDA is negative on an LTM basis.  The new investors would need to come up with something like a $50 billion equity check.  "

Amen
as with all prophecies from the Elon it is eventually proved correct... just a little later than initially predicted lol
prophesy
Best part is that he straight up warned them
The shorts used borrowed shares to sell stock back into the market. Now that Tesla+Capital Manager are guaranteeing a stock price of $420 the shorts will be forced to buy shared at high prices to replace the ones they borrowed. They paid interest and now will be forced to buy at premium prices. Huge loses especially as many failed to cover after the stock rose on the positive earnings report.
"You can ""short"" a company if you expect the stock price to go down. He means ""burn"" in that he's saying fuck you to the people that thought the stock price would tank for some reason."
"There's no such thing as a short burn.  However, if you are short in a stock you can get burned by a short squeeze.  To understand a short squeeze, you have to understand shorts.

If you sell a stock short, that means that you are selling the stock now with the promise to deliver it at some point in the near future.  For example, suppose some stock is priced at $300/share but you believe that it will drop to $275.  You borrow some shares and sell them for $300 then, a few days later when the price drops to $275, you buy shares to pay back the loan.  If the stock goes up instead, then perhaps you have to pay $325 to replace the shares you sold for $300.   It is worth noting here that a stock can only go down to $0 but there's no limit to how far up it can go.

Now the broker that lent you those shares isn't stupid.  Assuming there's no funny business going on, he's only going to lend you those shares if he knows that you can pay them back.  So the broker will limit the amount of the loan to 1/3 -1/2 of your total assets.  If the market takes a turn where either that is no longer the case, you will get a ""margin call"".  That means you have some short period of time (no more than a day) to fix it.  If you don't do so, either by selling assets to cover the loan or depositing more money, then the brokerage will sell your assets for you until you are back in line.

Now if that happened because a stock with a large short position went up, then you can get screwed two ways.  First, you have to buy the stock you shorted at a higher price than you sold it for.  Additionally, you're not the only one doing this so  suddenly there's a huge short term demand for that exact stock with little or no additional supply.  That usually causes the price to shoot up far beyond the stable trading range. That's a short squeeze."
"Tesla Motors is the most heavily shorted company in America. People are betting heavily that Tesla Motors fails by using a stock trade known as a “short sale“. If the stock price goes up then everyone who shorted Tesla Motors will lose billions and billions of dollars. They already do. People who short sell Tesla have lost billions and billions of dollars and if this stock buyout goes through they will lose everything. 

The most vocal social media personality who was speaking out against Tesla on a daily basis was recently uncovered as an operative from a stock trading company which short sells Tesla Motors stock so believe that these companies use every underhanded backstabbing trick that they can think of, every day in social media to try and make the stock go down.

Go check out Mark's Twitter right now. It is a comedic goldmine. 
"Chanos is a Greek name, the guy is Greek. The name means comber (the fish) and it is often used to describe someone speechless or someone dumb. It comes from how the fish looks with mouth wide open when it is sitting at the fishmongers.

I’m gonna go ahead and guess Mr Chanos and the other shorts looked at this news with exactly this expression. "
"FUCK JIM CHANOS 

FUCKING PARASITE "
Einhorn's twitter is a shitstorm right now
Would be funny if these people were all particularly acerbic long trolls...
"I don’t think Musk has the money to afford 90%, that would be $63.9 billion at that price, Musk is worth no more than $20 billion, and much of that value is in Tesla stock, which he can’t exactly sell in order to buy more"
"People who are backing the deal are buying now like crazy. Its cheaper than $420 so its free money at this point and after the public disclosure its no longer insider trading. All investors that want to stay are also buying like crazy, including the SA. And I'm sure Musk is buying too."
The sell price will be 420 though which is the all time high he's referencing
"Shared that were borrowed for shorting will be recalled forcing the shorts to buy at high prices, they lose billions. $13B?"
I think you mean 5X *earnings*.

"But he has to go public prior to the shareholders' vote anyway. And that has to be announced well ahead of time. 

So maybe he wants to start a bidding war or something."
That or he is making a 420 joke.
I wouldn't be surprised if the Tweet was done to ensure that biggest shorts could not escape.
"How does one secure $80 BN without having decided to pull the trigger, my thinking is that that would have been impossible. I agree with you that tweeting that he was thinking of taking it private at $420 is not illegal... but saying you have funding secured without having it... that would be bad. "
"I sold about 6 months ago, and I swear to God this morning I considered buying in, but decided against it. I'm not sure, but I think I'm glad I didn't. I have a hard time understanding the rationality of this announcement."
What do you make of him offering any current shareholder to remain a shareholder? There are laws against a company being owned by more than certain number of investors if those investors are accredited or employees. It’s something like 500 before needing SEC filings. 
"> That said, tweeting this prior to tactical execution of the deal is monumentally fucking stupid.

It might be.  But he knows more about the deal than anyone and isn't dumb so I'm inclined to think he has a reason for it.

Edit: Hey look at that, [funding already secured](https://www.tesla.com/blog/taking-tesla-private?redirect=no)."
"> the answer is probably

Such a lawyer answer "
"Not a lawyer.  Doesn't the following press release mean probably not?

https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2013-2013-51htm"
If he has no signed docs he's fucked. 
So could he drive the price up just to issue shares and raise money legally?
Maybe elon's just trolling the shorts. We know he likes to do that sometimes.
"Thanks for the info!

>it dramatically complicates the deal structuring and execution.

Would you be able to elaborate a bit on this?  I'm very curious about this whole thing, especially wrt how much preparation time it would take for this to actually go down.  Is it something we might see happen before the year's end?"
">Current hedgie

That's a big change! How'd you manage that?

>it dramatically complicates the deal structuring an execution 

Could you go into details on this?"
"Could it be an offer from a buyer he doesn't want? Tweet remains true, buyout never happens, TSLA stock (possibly?) jumps. I don't know if he's allowed in that case to turn the market jump into anything meaningful (e.g. securing loans).

Possible unwanted buyers would include e.g. Saudi Aramco, Chinese investment banks, etc."
Yeah that's what I was thinking of. What is going on in his head?
"He won’t follow through, he just wants to fuck the shorts directly in between the buttcheeks, balls deep. He did that with one tweet. When the stock was halted, they all shit their pants. "
"You are wrong, in the case of a public traded company everything should be done publicly. Hence, only if he shared the information privately or used private information that he would be committing a crime. In the end, as the media pushes the price of the company below its value ... Why not buy it ?"
"Ahh this makes sense - thanks for this aspect of what may be happening behind the scenes.  Either way that little nugget of news about the Saudi's position is the catalyst, for sure."
There is no chance for hostile takeover. Musk & friends have to much stocks.
Hostile takeover of Tesla would be a very dumb move. Elon's leadership is baked into the stock price.
Woah woah. When did the Saudis get in to this? Please ELI5 what they are trying to do and what Elon is doing. Is this why he is going private? To avoid the Saudi take over? Why wouldn't any number of his other competitors do the same?
Very very interesting. Thank you
"> As long as there were no trades for himself, or any other insiders that knew he would announce that he was ""thinking about it"", there is no law against it. 

Have you already forgotten that Musk bought stock at least twice this year? 

> Elon will need to find a stupid amount of capital and fast to do this.

Elon already **has** the funding secured. If he doesn't he'll be in jail for a long time.

"
"So do you think the investor lined up, that Elon is talking about, would be China and definitely not the Saudi’s?"
Tesla is in no way the world's largest solar producer.
Lots of the value of Tesla is wrapped up with Elon so there is no way they would attempt a hostile takeover 
Or would they shut everything down and then make more money on oil
"Or shut them down to keep oil alive. Just like Hershey buying all small chocolate shops. OK, not like that."
"Same here. Because the stock price just shot up - if he doesn't do it, is that considered a form of stock manipulation?"
Yes the executive of the company can 100% make public statements about their company. It only becomes illegal if there is pump and dump type activity occurring. 
https://www.tesla.com/blog/taking-tesla-private
"He's not saying he will do it if it reaches 420, he's saying he's considering paying 420 for the stocks he doesn't how."
"I know he's crazy and motivated enough to do it, but what if this is a ploy to do exactly what you're saying, to push out the shorts? The 420 price just seems too funny."
"If he tweeted this, shorts covered, and then he didn't do it... I think he'd be in a world of shit.

Unless it spikes over 420, he offers the 420, it gets voted no... I guess he's covered there. "
"Wow, quite interesting!"
They won't lose 13 billion. Their losses will be the difference between the price of TSLA when they are forced to cover and their cost basis which won't be zero unless they gave away the shares when they borrowed them. I wonder what the cost basis is for all shorts...

This might be me being dumb. But wouldn't it be way cheaper for him to do it now rather than waiting until the stock is at 420?
"It's the public company thing primarily. He's responsible to people and realizes the decisions and work he wants to make may be scrutinized or jeopardized. Shareholders hate uncertainty and risk taking to some degree and Elon likes to take it a few degrees beyond that (but keeps batting above average it seems and not striking out).

In a private company, you're not beholden to short-term earnings, shareholder anger, or twitter storms to such a degree as you are within a publicly traded company. You can also be removed as an executive (ala Men's Warehouse, BOLOCO, and a few other high profile cases)."
>So does that mean what ever shares I buy now has a high likelihood of rising to $420 in the near future?
"Does this mean, as a shareholder, my shares would be bought out once they hit $420??"
"> ~~Could be a reason why TSLA is spiking.~~

~~Almost certainly~~"
It also gives him control of the vision. The public is one less stakeholder involved to complicate things.
It's exactly why it's spiking
"What will happen to my shares when it goes private?  
  
Would tesla still release financial statements?"
Would one still be able to keep their current shares? What would determine the value of those shares after they go private?
I wonder if he did this to spike it and screw over the shorters on purpose hahaha
"Yeah you usually don't do this one the way up, you do it on the way down.  It would be the most expensive way to buy out Tesla he could possibly devise.  "
"It can't be that, he was giving away all that eth for free!"
Even if Tesla goes private you will still have oil companies and their PR firms bashing electric vehicles and Tesla by extension.
">The main thing that would be interesting to see is if Tesla went private, would most of the FUD dry up since they no longer have financial incentive to spread it?

Exactly what I was thinking. Someone needs to starting downloading all the comment timestamps for everyone negative and positive on Tesla and then compare the rates before and after the buyout. Then we will kinda know who had a financial motive to push one side or the other. "
FUD? 
"> would most of the FUD dry up since they no longer have financial incentive to spread it?

Yes.  Shorts will move on to the next target.  They have no incentive to trash tesla if they cannot make money off it.  They may hold a grudge, but at the end of the day, that shouldn't be enough for someone trying to make money in the market to waste time on a privitized tesla"
"> would most of the FUD dry up since they no longer have financial incentive to spread it?

Yes but not wholly for the FUD reason, the main reason would be because of a huge shortage of information. No earnings calls, no quarterly results etc. There would be far less to attack. "
">The main thing that would be interesting to see is if Tesla went private, would most of the FUD dry up since they no longer have financial incentive to spread it?

People who invest in fossil fuel are still going to have lots of incentive to throw around this FUD even if Tesla went private.

The main difference is that Musk will not be answerable to public shareholders who are too caught up in the rumor mill, and instead will be working with private investors who are perhaps better positioned to understand the nuance of the situation and will give Musk the longer term wiggle room to do what he wants instead of worrying about quarterly bullshit.

And that's what matters at the end of the day. I don't think Musk cares about the FUD itself. He cares about the effect FUD has on shareholders. Going private isn't going to dry up that well, but it will insulate him from it better."
"Outside fossil energy groups and certain others in similarly competing markets, very few individuals want Tesla the company to fail. However, a growing number of individuals aware of Musk's public comments (and historical statements) want him to fail personally. It's a very odd combination, and one no investor or futurist sits well with. 

As one of those futurists, having an EV company that forces the rest of the automotive competition to actually innovate is fantastic (ditto for Musk's other ventures). On the other hand, after working in the regulatory world, Musk's ego and recent news stories about his laissez faire operational attitude (including making striking allegations against individuals claiming to be whistleblowers) are incredibly problematic. 

Because of this, I believe it's better for Tesla to remain a public entity with Musk changing his role out for someone less publicly volatile and operationally more capable is probably better for both investors and the public at large than remaining in his current position and changing the company into a private entity."
"The UAW would still have plenty valid reasons to try to tear down the company, not to mention Elon himself will probably not delete his twitter, so he'll be throwing grenades on the fire on a regular basis, like every time one of their cars kills someone he'll be sure to blame the driver as quickly as possible.  "
"""The main thing that would be interesting to see is if Tesla went private, would most of the FUD dry up since they no longer have financial incentive to spread it?""

Yes, I think it would. People don't spend hours of their precious time trashing Tesla for no reason, they do it to help their short position. Otherwise, it's just hours of your day down the drain for nothing. Bear in mind that the high profile ones are proficient analysts with high earning potential, their time is valuable."
"Automotive industry experts became highly critical about Tesla. Tesla has become a brand similar to the beginning of Iphone Apple at the beginning. But the automotive industry is dominated by a lot of brands including mass brands, premium brands and sportscar brands. Now that Tesla had to take their time to build their infrastructure and production lines, the experienced automotive brands is catching up to the new brand. Tesla went into more production troubles than expected. The question wont be, do you want a hightech electric Tesla. The question will be, do you want an electric Tesla over an electric Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Porsche and so on. Tesla has also struggled with quality of material and assembly. Tesla car have various problems which are rather known by lower budget brands. Like rust, inaccurate compoments assembly, quality disparity in production lines. Things, customer would not accept from premium brands"
">if Tesla went private, would most of the FUD dry up since they no longer have financial incentive to spread it?

No.  Because most of it is ideological IMO.  ""Big Oil"" is ""Big Natural Gas"" these days. They want electric cars.  Big Coal is also electricity so they want electric cars.  Even auto companies like Chevy would probably be happy to sell electric vehicles.  The people who most want electric cars *to fail* are backwards inbreds who just want to stick their thumb in the eye of Libruls.  They've been doing it for free without any profit motive.  


EDIT: Fixed dropped ""to fail"". "
"The Tesla/Musk FUD is so bad now.  It's honestly competing for the 2016 election in terms of how badly it's polluting Reddit and other sites.
"
"No, that's not what it means.  It means they are no longer a publicly traded stock, and anyone who currently owns stock will get bought out at $420 per share."
"It also means the shorts are instantly defunded and the spammed media attacks get a lot less common.  Any trolls here that are funded by those shorts lose their job so this subreddit immediately improves.  The remaining self-motivated trolls can no longer complain about ""cash burn"" or whatever, Tesla can focus on the future and not on shareholder short term expectations (this is surprisingly less influential at Tesla than at many other companies that are burning the future for a dollar today but it's always a public company possibility) and again the company improves.  

The negative here is if you were holding Tesla hoping for Amazon-like gains in a decade  you aren't going to realize them.  "
"Not correct. Elon and friends, that own a combined total of 50%+1 of the shares, can decide on their own to buy out the other 50%-1 shares, and then take the company off of the stock market."
"Not necessarily.   SpaceX is a private company but they still hand out stock to their employees.   Then once every 6 months they have an outside auditor appraise the value of the company.   At that point if an employee wants to sell their stock the company buys it back from them.  So if an employee wants to hold their stock they can.  If the employee wants to sell they can.   It's a completely private market though and based on what the company is worth according to an appraisal not what the company is worth according to wild random swings of speculation or manipulation on the public market.     


Elon has referenced how much he likes this arrangement and how much he hates the public Tesla stock for some time.  [https://youtu.be/AHeZHyOnsm4?t=21m16s](https://youtu.be/AHeZHyOnsm4?t=21m16s)"
"Except that he'd still be answering to the private equity investors. As long as they are OK with that, he'd be ok."
">stock option compensation wont really be a thing like it is currently

SpaceX issues stock and buys back stock in liquidity events every 6 months.  So private doesn't mean you won't necessarily have employee stock incentives. "
Unless his account was hacked or he's super high lol.
Just set it and forget it. 
"I don’t know much about trading stocks (lot to learn before getting in as much as I would love to), but do you think the demand could fall as the price gets close to 420 thereby slowing down or plateauing just below that point?"
"So? I have to put that money somewhere. I'd rather have it in TSLA. 

I wouldn't sell a single share if it was $420 an hour from now. "
"But I was in it for the long-haul.

""Sooner"" is nice, but I think the company could be worth twice that (or more) in a few years."
"Is that their old price or am I missing something, their stock price right now is 207.11."
"Elon has said that you still could, and that he expects if it goes private it will return to publicly traded in the future"
We're going to find out if this is legal.
Totally legal as it's public info. It's just like announcing a product in terms of stock valuation.
"SEC issued a report in 2013 saying this is legal. It was after an investigation into Reed Hastings (Netflix CEO) posting on Facebook about monthly viewing numbers being over one billion.

https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2013-2013-51htm"
"I'm definitely not buying it now (considered it at like $295), but it just seems weird to publicly say ""i want to buy the shares at $420"" because that will affect the market."
That last part is so dumb. They don't need Tesla to do desert solar projects. No one in the industry uses Tesla's panel for large scale solar.
"Yeah, Apple or Google sounds quite likely. Apple obviously has a lot of cash and Musk is pretty friendly with the Google founders.

"
The easthetic of Tesla cars and the revolutionary component is so Apple. On that front they’re a perfect match
"In a sense he needs that much cash, but not really.   What he needs most is to have the existing large stakeholders agree to going private.   If they're on-board then you don't need to buy their stocks.
"
Why would he need to buy out investors that want to hold? He and a handful of institutional investors already make up ~45% of holdings.
[deleted]
"That's the thing about being a public company traded on an open exchange. The market doesn't care how you got your dollar- maybe you earned it fair and square, or maybe you stole it from a dying widow. The market only cares that you have the dollar.

It's why Elon is making this move, and threatening to take his company private. He doesn't want to risk people with a different vision from his gaining control of a company he sees as his baby."
"Okay, but it's kinda unrelated to the topic at hand ?"
War vs locking kids up in concentration camps and drugging them in the USA . Really who can judge. 
"> Is there any restriction other than how much the price would rise from pumping billions in?

No."
"They are trying to do it slowly and quietly. 
Per SEC regulations, they had to disclose their position - so now it's public information that they are building a large position which may be what Musk is responding to"

You're asking for an unlimited time stock option. Such a thing has a dollar value and it sure isn't $0.00
He has said that he will allow investors to remain invested after the buy-out.
you can request that your broker give you a paper certificate of your shares and hang it on the wall.  I have framed shares of the Panama Canal
"Yeah emotionally I'll be disappointed but when I bought stock back in the early years I bought it fully intending to ride it all the way into the ground on principle if that's what happened.  It would be a bit hypocritical of me to buy a stock fully intending to lose all of my investment on principle but be mad if I didn't make even more money.   


I just tell myself that I should be thrilled that my investment in its own small way achieved what I hoped it would: a viable electric car company that can make EVs mainstream. "

You don’t have to sell then.  You can still own stock in the private company.

Can you explain how that works?
"Might hold until the vote. If the buyout fails or is revealed to be manipulation, Tesla’s price could plummet"
35 million shares are shorted.
"https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)

>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

>To short an asset, means to bet that the asset will loose value. If the asset in question does indeed loose value, the person who shorted it will win the bet, and make a profit. For example, if you think that Tesla stocks will loose 10% of the value, you could short the stock, and make a 10% profit if it indeed goes down by 10%. However, if Tesla stock gains value, than you will loose the equivalent amount.

Love how Tesla is the example in the simple description/version"
"The problem is if any of his Twitter statements turn out to be false... this type of tweet could be a big problem for Tesla.   My guess is the right now his legal team are banging their heads on their desks.     Lol.   


...and trading Tesla stock has been suspended.   "
"Luckily in prior statements Telsa has disclosed that investor information can come from Elon’s twitter so I think they are covered from a legal perspective?  I hope Elon/Tesla really does have the financials lined up, otherwise there will be even more drama.   

I’m all for the shorts losing their shorts.  I wish Tesla all the best... heck.. one day I hope to join them.   


"
"I know I'm late to the party here, but presumably what they'd do is everyone who wants to stay in would technically sell their shares to someone like Fidelity. Fidelity is then the investor, and in exchange you get shares of the fund instead. This means that company would be the actual owner (and presumably be the one with voting rights) and you'd own some financial product, not actually Tesla."
I thought those restrictions were repealed within the last couple years?
In some alternate universe there is some kind of ICO happening. Thus allowing literally anyone to be able to invest. 
Sounds like that's the plan.
"No, that would be an SEC violation and Tesla would be exposed to massive liability on all the outstanding shares. "
Maybe this is what he meant by that short burn of the century comment? The plan to go private. 
I did - but I can't buy another one with my IRA for 20+ years...
Done. Now what? :/
It isn't Musk's money though.  The huge question here is who is putting up $50 billion of equity to do this at such a high valuation? And are they going to be happy starting a bidding war?
Only if they have 50%+1 shares worth of votes in favor of selling.
Just did!
Many of these posts were after the tweet but before the letter.
It’s very confusing to me because he says shareholders can keep their investment but also said it would only be able to be done similar to how SpaceX is structured where you have to buy a specific Fidelity Fund which only has 2-3% allocated to it. 
No.  Elon can buy as much stock as he wants. 
Not if he goes through with it to f with them. He warned them months ago.
[deleted]
"well, he said that ""he is considering it""... "
"why would he waste billions of dollars taking a failing company private? that doesn't make any sense and would lose him a significant amount of money, hurting his goals of funding settling mars."
Lol. He’s def spending billions to “cover it all up”... shut the fuck up
Excellent. I'll take option 3
"Or, invest in other companies investing in Tesla."
Not fair that the little guy can't grow his wealth too.
But how do I find SpaceX on Robinhood?
Elon just tweeted that if the company goes private investors can carry their shares over to the private company. This is a big relief. Not sure how stock valuation would work going forward though.
"""He can't be serious about starting a company to dig holes.""
""He can't be serious about selling flamethrowers.""
""He can't be serious about sending a Tesla to space.""

At this point, I'm not sure about anything anymore."
"It's still currently public. If there's a rush to cover by shorts plus increased demand by bulls who want in while it's still public, the price could easily be pushed to $420. If it's traded at over $420, then why would anybody sell at $420 when they try to go private? It won't be anything LESS than $420..."
Hahahahaha. Ha.
"\>they wouldn't have public investors breathing down their neck for profits.

""R U SURE U WANA INVEST IN A NEW BATTERY FACTERY ELIN? LETS KEEP THE MUNEY INSTEAD TO MAEK R QUARTERLY LOOK GUUD."""
"Yes but private companies typically have more difficulty with debt. A public $100b company is a safe debtor, because everybody and their mother can see what their financial situation is.

It’s part of the reason why public companies on average sell for like double the price of private ones."
"That's such a moronic statement. The vast majority of Tesla's investors have never thought that way. Tesla has never been profitable in its lifetime and those investors need massive growth because the stock is priced as if Tesla was already building millions of cars. They are all for all the growth investments Tesla can handle and have been more than willing to swallow incredibly losses and dilution of shares in the hope that years from now they will be rewarded for their patience. 

The people who do care about Tesla's profitability are the creditors that Tesla needs to fund their growth. Telsa burns through tons of cash every quarter so without a constant stream of cash infusions Tesla can't survive, nevermind grow. Tesla will continue to need those creditors, wether the company is public or private. "
"$420/share would put Tesla at \~70B, Uber is about the same."
"Gazprom is like 50 billion, it's cheaper than Uber. Also not sure you can call it private."
i kept one share.   I have a purchase order set if it drops below 330
I have a purchase order set if it drops below 330
Well mine are all under 420 strike. Would they get filled early? If they’re filled at expiry that would suck because of the time decay. Didn’t he do this with SpaceX too?
Tesla would have periodic events that would allow you to sell shares.  This is the same thing SpaceX does.  It allows employees for instance to cash out shares from time to time.
"I’m desperately hoping I’ll be able to turn some of my Calls back into shares to hold into privatization. Unfortunately I bought a lot of 2019/2020 350/360 calls. They didn’t move up much with the share price today because of the long time value. I’m really hoping there is a short squeeze to push the stock price past $420 so I can sell some of them and use the others to buy more shares back before the deal goes through. It would be worth it to me to own shares before privatization even at $450 since I’m planning on holding them for 10+ years, especially now with this news."
Mutual funds will have to sell which will mean there will be somes toxk to buy back for shorts.
"S3 Partners stated that short interest stood at nearly $13B on Tuesday.

Shorts lose everything, if $TSLA doesn't drop anymore and goes private, right?

If so, that makes up for years of FUD BS. I'm gonna have a very tight sleep tonight."
Oh missed that. 
How do you know that?
halt was triggered by the automated systems. 
"Elon has said that it was a mistake to take Tesla public, that is why he kept SpaceX private. He has new funding from the Saudis so has the chance to take Tesla private and has taken it."
"> extinguish their souls

What souls?  Parasitic sociopaths who relish the thought of sustainable technologies to fail in favor of fossil fuels have extinguished any minuscule soul they may (or may not) have had in the first place."
Same here also. Was hoping to hold for a good 10 years and being part of the journey. Nice to make a bit of cash but i prefer the ride. 
I'm voting no at $420 or anything close. 
Then why not take it private at the current price? Why try to get it to go up?
"Well if Elon owns around 22% and this is getting backed by Saudi money, and they own around 4% already, you’re looking at needing about 23% of the remaining shareholders to for for the buyout. Once you include the other majority holders that may become part of the buyout and hold shares after going private, it’s a pretty sure thing to go through. If the Saudi’s are going to pump serious money into Tesla, they could start a rapid expansion unlike anything we’ve seen and really go to Elon’s original goal of the expansion of EV and clean energy. "
"Likewise, yes being private meant that SpaceX does not have to worry about quarterly reporting etc. and invest for the long term."
"Yep, was down about 13% before they halted trading. As much as I am excited about this news, I'm also terrified about the long calls I'm holding"
"Thanks, good explanation."

"well actually, it puts a ceiling to their loss at 420. Many of us longs think they get off easy tbfh.  
edit: ofcourse all the interest they have been paying for years will be gone as well :D Man this week has been rough for Mr. Spiegel, Mr Chanos and Mr. Einhorn. Suddenly all lose unrealized losses will go in the books :P Atleast they get the tax deductible. "

"Not true, no one will be forced to give up their shares. "
thanks.
Because they can earn interest on them.
Ummm are you sure that running negative profits for years on end isn't a problem?
Why? They have what pundits say is a superior product. Why would they buy an inferior product?

Maybe Apple also comes into the mix with a stake in the company. They have a lot of cash sitting in the bank. 
Would that have any affect on how well his company is doing? 
"oh I have no plan of selling, I bought mine when it was in the early 100. I was just afraid going private means they will take my stock away."
"Based on his other public outbursts though, I have the feeling that it was still on purpose and a joke, under the blanket of using the word ""considering"".  I feel like there's definitely a gray area here, but leaning more to joke "
"It's crazy because you can argue both ways.  You can say that it's serious, which then is just a horrible business tactic on his end, or it's a joke and there's potential for illegalities.  Time will be interesting here "
"I don't think it's by any stretch to be far-fetched a weed joke.  Again, Elon isn't exactly the most PC twitter-user out there right now.

Nonetheless, https://www.tesla.com/blog/taking-tesla-private

Seems it was legit.  No need to be nasty about it.  These comments were all conversation (speculation) before complete information was available.  You don't appear smarter for only chiming in once it was all released. 

It's also not a me thing.  Any monitoring whatsoever of the original tweet has hundreds of sub-tweets with the same observation as mine.  

Kindly, "
"You have to disclose it. You dont have to disclose an all-time high price, $75 above today's opening price, on Twitter, before you are officially doing it.

Normally, people hold that info as long as they can because the rumour of something like that will instantly spike the price, like it did today, making any subsequent privatization more costly when it actually does happen."
Apple has already spent $250 billion in buybacks since 2012. They recently announced they're buying back another $100 billion too. It's not too out of the question to take Apple private I think. Just a matter of how long it would take.
Unless he whipped out as phone and sent that tweet the second the lawyers said the paperwork was signed
Does it have to be 51% or can it be 50.000001%?
"That does not sound like a free market to me .... where are we??? In fuckin‘ China!?!?

How can somebody force me to sell something I own??

That’s screwed up, man ... "
How is this not obvious
What if I want to buy more?
I do understand this but my basket is 50% TSLA 50% other things. Buy I do believe and understand TSLA and that is why I love buying it.
Do you seriously think he would intentionally break any serious laws in this case? I don’t think he is dumb enough to send out a tweet that would cause serious legal trouble to himself. 
Not if the deal is real. 
Report of unscheduled material events or corporate event
"""That Saudi guy"" would likely raise some hackles in Trump's lair, and would likely garner some unwanted attention from SEC/FTC/other governmental regulators."
I know right.  Guy is pretty clueless.  The stock could go to a trillion and Tesla the company would not get a dime of it.  You only get money when you sell or during an IPO.
"No he said he's ""considering"""
You're correct. The stock market is a secondary market.
Because it's a guaranteed payday.  You'd make $60 per share if you bought in right now and the buyout goes through at $420.
"It would seem 420 is a pretty low share price for a buyout if the company has such a promising future.

You following me now?"
"No, keep Elon as CEO. Timmy will fund Tesla privatley."
SEC has already responded to this?  Got a source?
"? Are you an idiot? 

He claimed that he has secured loans of 72 BILLION dollars. If he doesnt put up which he almost never does, shorts are going to sue him 9 ways to sunday.

Let alone the 16 SEC regulations he broke"
Funny I got down-voted for this and then it because an actual question whether it was an SEC violation. In my mind it amounts to a forward-looking statement by the only guy who matters and that kind of thing can really move the stock.
He himself also wants to stop worrying about stock price and can’t use it as a reward for employees if it fluctuates that much. He wants a break from Wall Street and be able to focus on actual problems at the factory.

Underrated comment of the year
"Markets do not care for the unknown. This was a completely out of nowhere (to basically everyone) tweet that had an obvious and severe implication on the stock price. I would imagine it was halted until the source was confirmed and everyone was assured that this wasn’t some jackass that broke into Musk’s twitter account and decided to have a little fun.

Anything other than to simply make sure everything was on the level would be a big no no.

Also, if you are curious, it was only 5 years ago that this sort of “announcement” was allowed to be made via social media. In 2013 the SEC issues a report stating it was ok after an investigation was done into a Facebook post by Netflix CEO Reed Hastings talking about Netflix’s streaming numbers breaking one BILLION hours monthly.

You don’t lose everything; if they get bought out at $420. You lose the difference between the price you shorted and what you have to buy it back for(and loss of the interest you had to oay as well). Unfortunately for a short that buy back price  could even be above $420 
"No they won't lose everything. They will lose the difference between the price they shorted at and $420. If they shorted the stock at $350 and it goes to $420 they will lose $70 per share they shorted. The key risk to shorting is there's no limit to what you can lose, unlike other types of investing where your losses are limited to what you invest. If Tesla stock goes to infinity...their losses will be infinity minus $350 (i.e. infinity)."
"Looking on Twitter, it seems Spiegel has upped his short position.

He's claiming preorder numbers are faked and that vast numbers of people has cancelled; nobody wants the cars and they are piling up, with tonnes of defects; retweeting fraud conspiracy theories from various pseudonymous troll accounts [but ofc a retweet isn't an endorsement, right, Mark :)].

Some of the stuff he claims and/or retweets seems contradictory. But, it's all negative, so that's good enough, I suppose. His followers are always bombarding people with crap on Twitter.

He's claiming Musk will be in trouble with the SEC now.

Either way, the narrative is going to be that he was right, whatever the outcome."

"The part that can get him in trouble is saying he has a buyout offer at $420. If that isn't 100% true, he can get in serious trouble for manipulation."
"Yeah, talk to bernies maddoffs first investors"
I'm pretty sure this is inside trading. 
"It looks interesting since apparently they won't need the full $80 billion.  Those investors who want to remain with the company (presumably even small shareholders of say just a dozen shares or even a single share) will be permitted to keep them after the ""buyout"".  What is being proposed is more of share rule change where you will be considerably more restricted in terms of how often you can buy or sell shares (day traders need not apply) and if you don't want to play by those new rules that there are enough other investors at that strike price to buy you out.

The main thing which is news is about the corporate investor rule change, although the strike price of $420 likely has several investor groups willing to buy in with that rule change.  He may not have the full $80 billion, but has enough to think that whatever other money he may need can be found in the nearish future with the proposed new rules.

If you want to buy & hold TSLA for several years, now would be a very good time to invest."

Market manipulation.
"The whole thing doesn’t make any sense whatsoever. There is no way that the company can take down the debt load for a traditional ‘going private’ transaction. And it’s not even close - this would be the largest LBO in history by a big margin. 

So they are going to have to use equity, and A LOT of equity financing. The thing is that they already have equity financing in place: their current shareholders. I’m going to guess that the total number of TSLA holders is somewhere between 10k and 20k. They would need to buy down to 250 holders to be ‘private’ - I don’t know how they can pull that off. What Musk is really saying is that he wants to swap out his investor base, but I’m not sure that his investor base is his real problem. If he wants an exchange for ‘private TSLA’ shares, there is almost certainly going the ability to short via either traditional or synthetic means. This transaction won’t stop people being negative on TSLA. 

I’d bet we get some sort of “we decided to stay public” tweet in a few months, which will then be followed by years of litigation. This is why regular companies never say anything until they are 100% ready/committed to the transaction. "
"I was thinking about that guidance when I wrote my original comment. I think that Musk’s extensive use of Twitter would ba his best defense. It’d be pretty easy to argue that any TSLA investor has to be following Musk on Twitter just for basic due diligence purposes. Honestly, if the SEC was going to go after Musk for his tweets, they would have done it a long time ago bc he’s been tweeting material info for a long time. 

"
"For anything else, raising the share price can help generate funds. I don't see how it can help generate funds.... to buy other shares."
"The problem with a company as large as Tesla means that even a casual mention of the deal can cause the investors to re-evaluate the stock price and more importantly will change the kind of investors in the public equity markets depending on how reliable that the information might be.  Coming from the CEO is sort of a gold standard of reliability here.

Investors trying to buy the shares in a buyout offer could get cold feet if the share price starts to skyrocket, and many times it turns into a sort of bidding war afterward.  Even if the offer was genuine, if the whole thing falls apart due to the subsequent fallout from the press it could also lead at least to an SEC investigation and possibly criminal charges being filed where it becomes a legal quagmire you simply don't want to get into.  Shareholder lawsuits and other legal actions start to take a toll.

It just helps everybody out that when you go public on something like this, that it is basically a done deal."
b e a utiful
you don't need to totally take over to cause a lot of trouble. 
"Wrong, Saudi Fund could put buy orders in for absurd prices to gain 25% or more of stocks and have controlling interest."
Unless you’re an oil rich country who stands to gain more from Tesla failing than you’ll spend causing them to fail. 
Why not both?
"He doesn't have to go through with this, but he couldn't make a false statement to this effect. Meaning he truly has the option. Presumably, if he's offering $420 for the stock, he (and whoever is investing alongside him) thinks it's worth much more."
I can only imagine the lawsuits if it doesn't happen.  And the lawsuits if it does ;)  
That’s not true. If he doesn’t actually have plans to take it private that’s stock manipulation. 
"Understood, I'm just making the point. Obviously anyone can offer whatever price they think is fair to buy shares. Doesn't mean someone is going to sell them. And he would need to buy quite a bit to follow through. "
Diabolical! I doubt that would be legal. Difficult to prove though. 
"That would fucking suck so hard. I love musk, I hope he isn't doing that because he would definitely end up in jail if that's the case."
"That would fucking suck so hard. I love musk, I hope he isn't doing that because he would definitely end up in jail if that's the case."

Why's 420 funny?
"There's no way in hell I'm voting for $420 personally, it's come within $50 as of today alone and has gone up more than that much in a single day already this week.  "
if i own a single stock how do I vote for shit like this?
How is this different than one media outlet posting negative (rumor) stories about a company without proper proof and then 12321312 other media sources copying it without even looking at it with stocks crashing after? Just because he is on the board? It would be hilarious to give those shorters/media outlets a taste of their own medicine.
"This news pushed the price up $30 in the last hour.  Presumably, I can't figure out what else would do it.  "
"The price difference is huge.  It's $380 in after hours right now, they may have hit an all time high since I last checked."
How on earth did you post 2 identical comments 36 minutes apart?  
"Not an expert, but I think the majority of shareholders have to approve a buyout, therefore you have to set a price high enough that most would sell over perceived future value of holding on to those shares."
He's proposing that Tesla would buy back shares at $420 per share. They have to offer a premium over the current price or else there'd be no incentive for current share holders to sell. Tesla has no control over outstanding shares they don't own themselves.
"He’s not saying he’d wait for it to trade there. They would tender an offer of $420/share and shareholders would have to agree to accept that price. Tender offers are always at a premium to today’s price to ensure that the shareholders would agree to sell. 
Imagine if you want to buy someone’s house really badly but it’s not for sale. If you were to knock on that persons door and ask him to sell, you’d need to offer a price that he won’t refuse or would at least have to consider."
"Usually buy-outs command more than market value because otherwise why go through the effort? I'm not going to sell you my share at current market value, I'd do it for a premium, however. 

He's saying he'd pay $420 per share for the remaining shares, not necessarily that once the stock hits $420 he'll buy the company at that price per share."
He has to make it interesting for the sellers. Otherwise they would hold on their stock and vote against make Tesla a private corporation. 
"$420 is the price they would conduct the buyout at. If they wait for the stock to reach that price, they would have to pay more."
"You're not dumb, you're just ignorant (my dad likes to say that the difference is that being dumb is permanent). And I am, too! I'm curious as to this answer, as well!"
"If you are an individual investor buying a few shares you just negotiate in the open market, so you get current price.

But the rules for large buyouts are a lot different. You can't just start buying shares all over the place until you surprise everyone by being a majority shareholder doing a takeover.

This may happen in the movies but in the real world large buyouts must go through specific disclosure requirements, discussions and approvals. This includes setting up a target price high enough that would still be relevant by the time the whole process is complete."
"Makes zero difference whether it's done now, tomorrow or in a month. The funding is there at $420 each.

Lets say you have 100 identical baseball card. The baseball cards are worth $50 each. You offer to pay $100 for each ($10,000 total) in 2 days. 

One day later, the baseball cards are now worth $80 a piece, you're still paying $100 for them regardless.

How much you pay won't change."
You have to offer a premium over market otherwise there’s no incentive to sell if you are a shareholder. 
">This might be me being dumb. But wouldn't it be way cheaper for him to do it now rather than waiting until the stock is at 420?

You can only buy up to a (relatively) small amount before you have to declare it publicly. From memory, it's around 10%."
Buying that many shares over the market even taking weeks to do it would rocket price past $420 easily
"They arent going to wait, he means that they will buy back shares at 420 to make it happen.if it comes to that."
"No. It won't make a difference to Elon at all.

Elon has around 20% of the shares, so if those shares are worth $1 0r $1000 he will have 20% of them. He will have to find shareholders willing to buy the other 80%. It will affect them and not Elon."
"""When this stock gets ~$70 more expensive, I will buy it""

Said no sane person ever."
"Thanks for this, I was wondering why he would favor private over public as I am a noob when it comes to these things. "
"The stock, in part I'm sure, is jumping because of this mindset. 

People thinking it's free money. Aka ""If the stock doesn't rise close to $420 by itself, then Elon's going to buy it for that price anyway""...

I'm not an expert by any means- but I personally wouldn't go sinking your life savings into TSLA because of this. He could turn around and say it was just a thought and the price could TUMBLE whatever it rose plus some. "
"It will rise to exactly $420 less the risk that the deal doesn’t happen. Right now there is no formal offer on the table so it might stay in the high 300s. If an offer is made it still won’t go to exactly the offer price because it might not happen for some reason, so the market prices out some risk. "
"No, if/when the vote goes through, and when the funds are 'approved' for the buy out, the stock will be bought out at that time at that price. 

So lets say the price is $395 at that time (unlikely, likely higher). You'll get $420 per share you own. Or a roughly ~6% payout."
It spiked +15 before the tweet on the saudi news
"No - that is because of a report of Saudi taking a 3-5% position in TSLA on the secondary markets, i.e. the stock market.

They could be one of the financial backers for the proposed plan above.  

Smart move, since they have the largest/cheapest oil reserves.  They understand exactly what is at stake in the long run.

"
"Brilliant IMO, this will make the stock climb to near $420, causing a massive short squeeze without Elon breaking any SEC laws.  People are trading based on a public statement that is no promise, only a pondering.  He won't have to actually do this (he never did back in 2013 when he considered doing it in partnership with Google), but it will still start a hard squeeze on short positions."
I could see oil companies being investors as well as other car companies.
"yeah,
... and auto dealerships
... and UAW
... and legacy car makers
... and ..."
One would generally expect more discussion of a public stock because the information is actionable.
"Fossil companies of all kinds have a lot to lose if Tesla's model succeeds in the long term.  This is regardless of who has ownership of the company.  To be sure, people affiliated with those companies surely hold some of those short positions that are incentivizing the sensational coverage of the company.  However, it's probably dwarfed by the money that some fossil fuel companies stand to lose as Tesla and their technologies mature."
"FUD wouldn't dry up because short sellers lose incentive, FUD would dry up as news outlets would lose incentive. Tesla is a very popular and controversial stock among the general public and every article about it gets a crazy amount of clicks because everyone either owns stock, has owned stock, or knows someone who owns stock. Furthermore, Tesla the company and Musk the person are controversial in and of themselves whichs generates interest in reading about them, especially when it's doomy and gloomy. You are over simplifying things in a conspiratory way. "
How are the experienced auto brands catching up to Tesla? Because I see just the opposite. The legacy brands are digging in and counting on Trump and this administration to save them

"Please bare with me about the understanding of the stocks and such.

When I own the stocks of a certain company, I sorta own a little part of it. Right? Now this man comes along saying I'll buy everyone's stock at $420, what if I don't want to sell? In an open market how can he decide a price? Will he need to own 51% or 100% to make Tesla pvt? 
"
"Potentially stupid question, but does this mean if I buy stock right now at $367 I will be bought out at $420?"
"What if I don't want to sell? Surely they won't have the right to force me into selling, right?"
"> The negative here is if you were holding Tesla hoping for Amazon-like gains in a decade  you aren't going to realize them.

This is the worst part.  Fuck"
"Also, just making this public instantly burns the shorts. If it becomes more serious, then you will start to see shorts jumping ship, driving up the stock price and hitting shorts even harder. Then, once the stock goes over $420, which it would in this scenario, you could see the buy out go up or taken off the table, or see the the stock slowly retract back to the $420 price until the sale goes through. But one thing would be for sure, you would see a major short burn..... hmm.... it’s almost like someone predicted this, maybe it just took a little longer than he planned to secure the financing. That $2B paper loss just became close to $4B today and could go up above $7B by the time this is all done. "
"And that's a big deal. I know myself and others are looking to support the company through to the future, and also hoping to be a part of that rise."
"So everyone who criticizes Tesla must be a troll huh? Because there is absolutely no real flaw with the company and they’ve never ever made any mistakes.

If anything, shills from Tesla PR will also be losing their jobs, and we can get back to discuss their tech and the product and the ownership experiences. 

I’m looking forward to that."
The negative here is this sub is essentially a ghost town because that's the end of public disclosures from Tesla.  
Thanks for the response and explanation! It looks like Elon just tweeted a similar response to someone on Twitter. 
"Right, but it will be different than how its handled currently.

"
What if I forget it and I die with millions?
"But you can leave it in Tesla.  He specifically said he'd have a fund allowing current investors to remain invested - that he hoped people would do so, as well.  Doubtless because he wants private but doesn't want to actually pay out that much."
"Yeah mine has been 50% at 500, 1000, etc. for a while "
Exactly my sentiment. Couldn't have said it better myself. 
But what if it belonged to the Saudi government... would you sell then?
[deleted]
">  could be worth twice that (or more) in a few years.


try , it could be worth 10 times that within the next 8 years. and we will get closer to why i invested.  Or as Elon likes to say, I could be an order of magnitude more in the the next 8 years.

"
"True, it could double... or it could be worth nothing. In the investing world there is nothing better than guaranteed money  "
"apple has more shares outstanding than telsa.

Apple has 4.83B shares at 211.88 a share giving them a market cap of 1.023T


Tesla has 170.59M shares at 379.57 a share giving them a market cap of 64.75B.


So since there are more apple shares than tesla shares , then when you own 1 tesla share you own a higher percentage of the company than if the percentage of apple you own with 1 share of apple.



So now return to 2 years ago approx when elon said that in 10 years Tesla would be worth as much as apple is.  At the time apple was worth 700B and Tesla was worth 45B.   


So.... For tesla to have the same market cap as apple at 700B.  Tesla stock would have to go to 4200/share approximately without splitting or diluting.


I bought stock approx around then because I do believe that is where telsa was going to be in 10 years.    I dont want to sell at 420,  I want the 10 year(tesla worth as much as apple) 4200 a share.


Hope I explain that effectivly. 


edit: $700B/170.59M tesla shares = 4103 per share."
"I think this, plus Donald Trump's tweets re. the collusion case, will be very interesting for Twitter's future. If a case of stock manipulation is brought against Musk it'll hinge on the idea that a tweet from him constitutes an 'official press release'. It'll be similar with Trump's tweets if a case is ever brought against him, how seriously should a tweet be taken"

"What are you coo coo birds talking about?  Disclosing information about your company has NEVER been illegal, unless there are NDA's involved with 3rd parties.  Get your heads examined.  Lying about your company or making trades on secret knowledge before that knowledge is made public is illegal."

How is it 'public info'? 
Buying anywhere under 300 is easy money. Recommend.
What do they use?
"And around $300B in cash just waiting to be spent.
"
"A big reason is that Apple likes its money. They do not have enough cash currently in the US. They would get favorable bank loans (~1%) for this purchase, which is cheaper and a better rate than how much would be taxed by bringing the money back home (I believe 15% currently). No US bank had any knowledge of this taking place. Apple knows how to do great accounting; better than any other company in the world pretty much. They also wouldn't really like how Elon tweeted this. Apple is the largest company in the world by market value, they control the shots. Not Elon and Tesla. 

TLDR: it’s not Apple "
He just needs someone to be willing to commit. But they won’t actually have to. But for SEC purposes someone needs to be willing to front the whole thing. Existing investors included but not you and me. 
"nah b, see he needs those internet points"
"Tesla, the new Nestle. "
We can judge them as both wrong. 
Given the timeframe i'm fairly confident he just reacted to the Saudis.
not sure if trolling or serious. i thought 2030 was referring to the year.

I think it would depend on if he actually secured the funding. Which seems to be the only meaningfully thing in all of this.
"From reading what's out there, he clearly wants to do it, it's just that it requires a shareholder vote.  

"
"Also said ""funding secured"". However, there is no way funding is secured if he was actually still in the consideration phase.

So ... did he lie? If yes then he has a *big* problem now. If he didn't lie he still has a big problem because then he isn't considering this anymore."
Yeah but that's quite hard unless the exposure is huge.
"That's a discussion that will lead nowhere. Tesla (or any other company) has no obligation to help the little guy make money. Their obligation is only towards the investors and depending on if, how and when they'll go private they may even accept little guys if they are willing to accept the huge risks. If not, then the little guy can invest in companies that have invested in Tesla or invest in other companies with a similar mission and plan."
Buy some of the Fidelity holding that includes a piece of SpaceX.  That or buying shares in some other company that has invested in SpaceX.

Oh yeah like he's so pressed. He made an apology and it got him an 11% boost a week ago.
Apparently Elon doesn't have trouble finding credit for a more than $70 billion stock buyout.
"koch industries is worth well over 100 billion dollars. Other companies like cargill are too. When you hear uber is worth the more they are typically talking about startups and unicorns, not every single private company. "
"Well, you may want to worry a bit because I made that comment before I was aware of Musk's plan.

The stock may never dip to $330 if proof about the investment is provided.

Right now you can either buy in at the current price or wait and see what happens (you may lose your chance to buy in forever or you may avoid losing a lot of money is something happens to Musk's plan)."

"Elon said, you can still invest in Tesla. You don't have to sell at $420. He even said, he wants all investors to stay.

More info on that should come soon(ish)."
There are plans to let existing investors keep their shares on the private side. So you can remain an investor if you want.
"You can still keep them by becoming a private investor, just like Elon pointed in his tweets. Look them up for more information."

For the car. Not necessarily the autonomous tech. Then they could combine and refine. Tesla had tons of real time data also. 
Alphabet would be able to integrate their technology at the time of manufacturing. They would need hundreds of thousands of vehicles to build out a national service.

Nothing relevant to paradigmatic thinking.
"Yeah we just don't have enough details to do anything but speculate at this point. I'm always skeptical of coincidences, but I know as much as you do."
"Probably not going to be a big deal in the grand scheme of things.  By the time they actually finish their enforcement action, Musk will have either done the buyout attempt, or, if it falls through, will have some lawsuits to deal with that will be far more damaging than a multi-million dollar fine."
"And if this is real, they're about to receive $420 on a cost basis that's presumably at least $50 below that. 

If this is not real, then it depends why.  If twitter got hacked, not sure what will happen.   If Musk actually doesn't have funding lined up to do this, then I assume this is actionable by the SEC as fraud.

In any case, there's no reason for an investor to sell right now unless they just want to free up the cash for something else."
[deleted]
"yes he wrote he has the funding and only thing remaining is shareholder vote. So its completely on par with your ""demands"". "
"A company can't spend its own money to take itself private - the money to buyout the company would have to come from external sources.    Buybacks have nothing to do with that - they don't change the market capitalization of a company.

As Ukleafowner said, doing a trillion dollar plus deal (since it would have to be done at a premium to today's valuation) makes it very very unlikely that this would ever happen to Apple."
"The bought-back shares effectively belong to the current shareholders.  If the company goes private, they're still going to want compensation for them."
Holy shit you were so right 
Should be able every 6 months or so
"Do you think stocks normally get halted when they are only up 7%?

Yea I think he fucked up somewhere. I don't know to what extent though. 

But you missed my point. The guy I replied to claimed Elon purposely made this announcement to fuck over the shorts and that he has no intent to actually do this. That would be 100% illegal. You can't debate that. 

"
"Depends on what ""change his mind"" meant.  I took it as he was never planning on taking it private just to squeeze out short sellers, he would have to prove the deal actually fell apart (SEC would definitely investigate this)"
"agree, but it deal is real he should have had it send via other channels instead of his personal one."
Yeah I was just reading on that. If I could remember names even a tiny bit I would have said it lol
Doesn’t matter. /u/TheYeags is saying Elon tweeted this to make the stock price rise and would cash out instead of actually follow through. That’s very illegal
"They can still accept investors but that's irrelevant.

The long thesis will hold true even if the company is private. The only thing that changes is that the average Joe will only make a lot of money instead of huge amounts of money."

Thinking you need to defend Warren fucking Buffett from someone obviously jokingly referring to him as a pussy is even weirder
"I like Uncle Warren as much as the next guy, but that's a *bold* statement for which you've offered no evidence.  Do you mean that *literally*?

Edit: I should clarify - I simply mean to ask what criteria we're using to define him as ""the most successful investor of all time"".  He's clearly one of the greatest examples of a successful investor in modern history, but to declare him *the greatest in all of history* seems like it should require some further explanation."
The future success of Tesla does not negate risk. 
"Generally, unless they buy the entire company they don't like passing a threshold of (I believe) 9% because once they own more it gets a lot more involved with filings or something.  I can't remember what that threshold triggers but Buffett has spoken publicly about it on more than one occasion.  I guess if he likes the company enough he will deal with the extra involvement or even welcome it. "

"Three people are now saying that there can't be insider trading, because the information was disclosed to the public in an appropriate manner. That's misleading. There could have been trades made with the tweet in mind. The whole idea behind illegal insider trading is that it's done *without* or *before* disclosing essential information to the public. So if an exec buys or dumps a major amount of shares because he knows the tweet is coming, that would be illegal insider trading.

I'm not saying there is insider trading happening, but it's not strictly ruled out like others suggest. I have no idea who they've been upvoted by."
Stop I can only get so erect.
Just a bit?
"You can't, which is where the burn part comes in.  If not enough people are selling when the shorts need to buy back, the stock price skyrockets until someone is willing to sell."
"btw shorting the company in the stock market is borrowing the shares and immediately selling them *because you expect the price to drop*. The once the prices drops you buy them back at that lower price and return the shares to the lender, keeping all the profit.  (That's how it's *supposed* to work)

Obviously these short sellers will have to repurchase shares at a much higher price because the price never plummeted as they expected.  So, buurrrrrnnnnn."
No problem. If you have money and want to lose it all join us in /r/wallstreetbets.
"simplified:

you borrow shares from someone and sell them. When you 'repay' the person you borrowed the shares from you pay them back the then current value for the same amount of shares you initially borrowed.

So if you borrowed 10 shares for 10 dollars, you'd sell em for 100 dollars. If these shares dropped to 2 dollars, you'd repay him 20 dollars and profit 80 dollars.

This means you can never profit more than your initial investment, as opposed to normal stock which can increase tons.

So if Elon buys up all shares at the all time high nobody that shorted the stock will earn a cent. On top of this, short positions come with all sorts of extra costs so everyone who bet that Tesla will drop will lose money
"
"To short a stock, you borrow it from someone and sell it. Ideally, when the stock drops, you buy it back and return it to the original owner. So your profit is the original sale price less the later buyback price. On the other hand, if it goes up, you eventually have to buy it back at a higher price and return it, resulting in a loss. 

The main issue with short sales is you are capped at 100% gain (i.e. stock falls to zero) but you have unlimited loss potential (e.g. stock can skyrocket to 1000% or more), the reverse of regular investing."
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp
"I guess, but Tesla has not once made a profit. Not ever. They are still losing money even today. If I started a business selling $100 bills for $20, I could have one of the most popular businesses in the world selling a fantastic product at a great price. Doesn't mean I have a sound business."
Good analogy.
">Spiegel, whose fund is short Tesla by holding puts that expire in January 2020, said it was “unfathomable to me” that anyone would finance a Tesla leveraged buyout."
"So he's giving a perfect example of why Tesla would be better off private, without all this constant examination of production minutae and focus on deflecting bullshit arguments and complaints. 

Musk has said many times that it would be a lot easier if Tesla were private.  Now they're on a good pathway, that opportunity can be investigated in detail."
"Well, announcing a buyout and price without details, without an 8K, without even a statement from the company drawn up sure looks a like a recipe for SEC trouble."
Mark Spiegel protected his twitter account so only CONFIRMED FOLLOWERS can tweet to him. He blocked Galileo Russell of Hyperchange TV.

"I don't see how it broke the law, he talked about it with board a week before that."
"Yes all the shorts will be forced to cover soon at prices way higher than what they paid.

Shareholders have to vote to allow their shares to be bought out at the proposed price. You have to offer an above market value price to entice them to vote yes. 

Personally I think that $420 is a generous price for $TSLA now, but I think that long term the stock could be worth much more so I will probably hold most of my stock(if that is an option)."
Got it. My bad. Thanks. 
That's what I thought also.

"It's not. It could be if he is provably benefiting on publishing the information now, like if he just bought a ton of stock, but just the information we currently know is not insider trading. "
Insider trading is making trades based on non-public information. His tweets today is making information public. Literally the opposite of insider trading.
No. Unless you have evidence of actual trading.
"> Those investors who want to remain with the company (presumably even small shareholders of say just a dozen shares or even a single share) will be permitted to keep them after the ""buyout"". 

This is one of the reasons we know this is bullshit. Who the fuck would purchase a risky asset, make it illiquid, and not even own it outright? "
I'm pretty ok with octupling my money. No need to get greedy.
Because I have doubts about their ability to hit their numbers. I'm perfectly happy with the amount of money I've made.
"""mass"""
Are you guys completely delusional? Saudis aren't gonna spend $70 billion freaking dollars to ... close Tesla.
">Unless you’re an oil rich country who stands to gain more from Tesla failing than you’ll spend causing them to fail.

I don't think the saudi plan is to crash it into the ground. At this point all the majors are going to push EV's in the next few years. They're doing what all the other oil companies are doing, diversifying. "
"I think it's way too late for that. All of the majors have jumped on the electrification train, plus all of the small new companies, dozens in China..."
Seems really iffy and a gray area there. 
Basically hoarding all the massive upside for the super wealthy to take advantage of?
"That's what his ""Funding secured"" was about. That shows that he has at least talked with other individuals about this and is showing that it is an ""option"" to him. "
"Well given he said ""am considering"" and ""funds secured"" I think it's reasonable to expect that either a) he's intentionally lying and misleading or b) he does have plans to take it private"
 He must have plans to at least attempt it. And somehow from somewhere he must have the money. 
"No, no crime as long as he considers it and there are entities that have expressed to him a willingness and ability to participate in the buy-out"
Prove it brut
"It's legal if he gets the deal together and pushes it to vote, even if it doesn't pass (which it won't based on today's market alone).  This burns shorts either way."
"Imho Tesla is simply more likely to succeed as a private company. I want Tesla to succeed in changing the world to electric transportation and have no real qualms missing out on some possible capital gains if this makes that more likely.  
  
But to each their own I guess."
TSLA could let shareholders vote the company go private while retaining their shares. It sounds like that will be an option on the table - one which I plan on taking.
"As I understand the plan. It’s not a compulsory buy out.  Elon’s going to provide an option to sell out at $420 but no requirement.  You can still own and trade shares privately.  The choice is simply a public / private market, if you’re a shareholder already."
"You can also vote yes and keep your shares, you just won‘t be able to trade them on the open market. Also, if the proposal was rejected by shareholders, the stock would plummet, so that alone is reason enough not to do that. "
I usually get a mailer from my brokerage about how to vote when share holder meetings happen.  But I do know what the threshold on how much you have to own.  My holding is not that big but definitely a lot more than one share.
Through your broker. Although us poor people don't have much influence 
"You probably can't, there's usually a share value that you must hold in order to have a voting share.   It's usually pretty low so maybe 1 share is enough but you'd have to check."
Yes
"I am shocked by this announcement, just recently he said ""Good Morning :)"".
Believe that this company will be saved if reached $420/ stock. Might be reached under this week..?"
"I can't find any info on the average cost basis of all short positions but  even if the difference is huge, the cost basis would have to be $0 (meaning they gave away their borrowed shares for free) if they covered at $380 to have a $13 billion loss."
">therefore you have to set a price high enough

Maybe he set the price number **because** he was high enough."
Makes sense. Thank you!
[deleted]
I feel $420 is not high enough. Not that much of a premium. I wouldn't mind $450.
"For buyouts, the board has that jurisdiction. Their duty is to the shareholders, who would want a premium. $420 is probably enough (~15% premium)."
What if I don't want to sell my Tesla stock? Am I forced to sell it?
"If a majority (but not all) of the shareholders agree on a buyout, are all the shareholders required to sell?"
"No, he's proposing a hostile takeover of his own company. Effectively, it's the same as Apple stepping in and offering 420 a share for the company.  
  
Hell, the funding MAY BE from Apple for all we know."
"That's not what he said though, if they are offering $420 for shares, then the share price is going to quickly rise to $420+  I can't understand what investor would sign on for this. You don't fix a price before hand like that."
For some reason i thought he would go private if the stock ever hit 420$. Thanks for the thorough answer.
He'd have about 25 minutes to get someone to sell to him at $420 before the trading price hit $425 by the looks of it.  
What will happen is the stock price will shoot to $400 and he's causing that massive short burn he promised.
"Elon Musk Replying to @Gfilche
""My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if we’re private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity’s SpaceX investment."""
"The saying is: **""Ignorance can be cured, but stupid is forever.""**"
Of course it does. If the stock price shoots above 420 then the buy out is meaningless.
Surely this isn't just a stunt to get his stock rallying... or is it?
"> He could turn around and say it was just a thought and the price could TUMBLE whatever it rose plus some.

I doubt that, as it'd be securities fraud."
"Saudi news?

Edit: Oh I missed that earlier"
"Yeah sorry, I totally missed that story"
They couldn’t be one of the backers — that would mean that they traded on insider information. 
He has some very rich friends like Sergey and Larry who could finance a takeover to fend off the saudis on their own.
"For sure it will squeeze shorts, however Musk's statement is not that far stretched. They might offer a found for current stock holders to stay invested in the company or take 420. Musk is a funny guy for sure. "
A significant partnership between tesla and toyota would be very beneficial for both companies.
Its just an experiment. Cool your jets. 
"Not talking about american brands. Don't know about them nor care much about them. Talking about the mass brands and premium brands in Germany, France, Italy and Japan. They are late at transitioning to electric cars for series building but let's be honest Tesla isn't exactly that advanced here with so many preorders not produced yet. The big manufacturers have research electric car for decades but didn't care to implement them since their traditional cars are way more profitable. But with the scandals and electric cars becoming more and more popular and supported, almost all brands have introduced small practical electric cars(small cars are much more popular than in the US) and announced regular c-class size electric cars for the next few years."
He meant don’t want. I’m almost positive. 
lol. Fixed.

"Yes, you own a tiny piece of the company and you also get a correspondingly tiny vote in how the company is run.  These votes can be for all sorts of things including change in management and changing the company's big priorities.  When the proposal to liquidate (sell) all of the shares is taken to a vote, you are welcome to vote against it.

However, the biggest shareholders are going to have far more votes than you do (literally millions of times more voting power) and they will likely agree to the buyout at $420."
"Then you and everyone else who owns stock votes on it. If a majority of the shares want to sell, then everyone has to sell. "
"Think of it like any corporate acquisition. If the majority of the shareholders agree by vote on a sale price (usually denominated in a total amount, but also often cited in amount per share), then said person can purchase the company at that price. Shareholders can reject the deal and wait for a higher bid as well. The thing to keep in mind, though, is that Elon owns 20% of the shares. So he needs 30% of remaining shareholders to agree. If just FMR (10%), Baillie Gifford (7.5%), T. Rowe Price (6.5%), Vanguard (4%) and Blackrock (3.3%) all agree with the proposal, he's pretty much already at 50%. Individual shareholders have too little of a vote to make a difference."
"you don't have a controlling share, so your vote essentially doesn't count if the majority vote to sell."
"Yes, but idk how serious he is about this. It also depends on when this would happen, what happens if the stock goes above $420 after Q3 earnings? Idk"
"Most likely, yes.  There is no guarantee that it will be at $420 though."
"Assuming this goes through, yes."
Yes
"Yes, IF he goes through with it and $420 is the price.  Don't buy the stock betting on this right now if that is your only reason to do so.  This could be a calculated move to drive the price up and squeeze out all but the more bearish shorts - stock already jumped over $20/share on the news, likely killing a few short positions already."
"**IF** they buy at $420, then yes. Could be less, could be more, could not happen at all."
"It means there's a chance that could happen, but it's not a certainty.  All we've got right now is a (mostly) non-binding tweet from the CEO.  There are many more steps that need to occur to make it really happen.

On a semi-related aside, he really shouldn't be tweeting this sort of thing.  I'm sure his corporate council is yelling at him about that right now."
"yes, but elon didn't make a promise to buy at $420 just yet.. but damn him for being cheeky about that figure."
It means you may be bought out at $420 if the sale goes through all the hoops.  The uncertainty of the follow through is the reason the price didn't jump straight to $420.
"It's not a stupid question, but remember that you're the one millionth person to have the same idea. That's not really the way to make money in the stock market.

At the time of me writing this, things are very cloudy as to the legality of his announcement. Tweeting information with major financial impact is not how it's usually done. The SEC has a lot of laws about this, and to be honest I think there's a small chance that this announcement  is not the result of rational thinking."
Do you have money to gamble?
they do. it's happened to me before with other stocks.
"They do. If more than 50% of shareholders decide to sell, they can force everyone to sell."
"You can vote against the delisting. But if the majority of voting shares vote to delist, you have to accept money for your now invalid shares."
"If the board (elected by stockholders) votes to sell at price X, then all stockholders receive X for every share they hold.  When the board approves a sale, stockholders don't have any rights to refuse to sell their shares.  This will include all stockholders, including board members and founders.  Musk's shares will be sold as well. 

  
He will certainly be a major stakeholder of the private investment firm."
"They're not forcing you into selling. The company is liquidating the security. The share is no longer representative of a stake in the company, and they offer you $420/share as compensation"
"You have no choice - it's compulsory. Think about past mergers between public companies (Solar City being bought by Tesla, for example) - those with shares in Solar City had no choice but to let Tesla purchase their shares because more than 50% of the shareholders agreed. "
"Of course they have the right. If the majority of shareholders approve of going private, everybody will be forced to sell their shares. "
"As long as you get at or above fair market value, yes they can force you to sell."
He just tweeted they could create a fund for people like you https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/07/tesla-stock-jumps-on-musks-tweet-that-he-is-considering-taking-compan.html
"They can force you to sell, but Elon won't do that.  He has a structure in place with SpaceX that allows investors to continue to invest without making the company public.  He'll do the same thing with Tesla.

And to clarify something a lot of people seem to be missing:  Elon has no interested in buying all the public shares.  He has investors who would go  in on the deal with him."
"Quote from Musk's letter

>First, I would like to structure this so that all shareholders have a choice. Either they can stay investors in a private Tesla or they can be bought out at $420 per share, which is a 20% premium over the stock price following our Q2 earnings call (which had already increased by 16%). My hope is for all shareholders to remain, but if they prefer to be bought out, then this would enable that to happen at a nice premium."
"If you hold more than 51% of the shares, they don't =) If you don't then whatever the majority decides happens."
"It's a mandatory corporate action that applies to everybody if it wins the shareholder vote.  You get one vote per share, and the cards fall as they fall.

Voluntary corporate actions exist where each shareholder can chose what happens to their shares, but that's usually just for things like ""do you want a cash dividend or just more shares?"""
"It's fantastic for Tesla, it's not great for longs.  It's an execution order for Chanos."
Same. I want to hold on to my shares for at least 10 years
At least the world gets saved.
He did say they would set up a private fund so current investors could stay in...see his other tweets.
"Not true, Elon said you can keep your stock, a fund will be set up for existing holders who want to retain their holding"
Elon said they will allow shareholders to keep their shares in the private entity.
"Vote against it then.  I mean, it's unlikely he'll succeed with a hostile takeover plan so your vote does matter in this instance. "
It only burns the shorts if his plan doesn't fall apart.  The stock is going to crash harder than it ever has if he loses the vote.  
"Yea, I don’t actually want this to happen"
"> Because there is absolutely no real flaw with the company and they’ve never ever made any mistakes.

They've made plenty of mistakes, but none of the financial ones will matter anymore (except to the handful of private shareholders). As such, you won't have a bunch of bored dudes hanging around online arguing about cash spend and margin. The only publicly relevant metrics will be related to their vehicles and treatment of employees."
"No, and you don't have to make that assumption.  Those are assumptions you make for yourself because it's what you want to believe."
"If the sub goes back to being a place for owners to hang out and talk, that's another win.  It's hardly a ghost town and wasn't even before all these new owners took delivery.  The financial arguments won't be missed."
"He had not tweeted that yet at the time I posted. 

It will make it harder to continually buy in. For instance, it's been pretty easy to use limits and catch the dips over the last few years. That will no longer be possible. "
What? You would make a ton of money? Tesla continues and you can still indirectly own the company.
Do you sell immediately upon any gain? If not you aren’t following this advice
Thanks for typing that all out and explaining it. It makes a lot of sense now.
Trumps tweets are already considered official. They get logged into that Congress Hall of records.
"They can be taken seriously enough to get people fired, that is for sure. It will be interesting to see how it plays out now."
"There is a press release on the Tesla website, so no need to pull Twitter in front of a court."
"> If a case of stock manipulation is brought against Musk it'll hinge on the idea that a tweet from him constitutes an 'official press release'.

I don't think so, I think it just coming from him is all that matters and it wouldn't need to be official. Imagine if instead of twitter he just spoke it while in a room of some of his rich friends who then bought at <$420 knowing it would spike and they could make bank. That's textbook insider trading. 

On second thought, maybe because twitter is public it's fine since technically he is telling literally everybody? Unless that's what you meant by official press release, in which case nevermind my bad."
I think you need to relax. Shelf the name calling at a minimum.
How is it *not* public info? It was posted on a public forum by the CEO.
"Canadian Solar, Trina Solar, Jinko Solar, Hanwha Q Cells, JA Solar, Risen, Longi, GCL Systems, Suntech, First Solar, SunPower.

Those are the panel manufacturers. You also need solar inverters, which Tesla doesn't make. Lastly, all these decisions come down to the decision of the financiers, engineers, and contractors, who develop, build, and own the project."
Think he plans to have a fund wich invests in tesla. So you own part of the fund wich owns the shares. You do not have any power in the company though.
You'd be surprised at how many large ports are actually owned by businesses. 
Never said I was the original owner of the certificate.. 
"No offense but, clearly don't know enough about trading if you don't understand how this is going to impact your position. Even if it's fuck you money, it's sincerely stupid to misshandle it. Do yourself a favor and start reading on share holder agreements, and what's its like to do a higher level of diligence during earnings calls. You're going to be holding the stock of a man who right now just ticked out the entire SEC. "
Very much /r/expectedthanos. 
"Just because it's a part of the financial system doesn't in any way mean it's not parasitic.  It totally is.

The financial collapse during the housing bubble was all part of the financial system, too.

EDIT: made my point more clearly."
"That sounds great in theory, but in practice, its rumors and FUD that create profit for them.  Not any real analysis. In this very specific case."
It is wikipedia - change it 
"It's not a thing and it won't happen. The post above talking about investing in a fidelity fund is the only way this could even kind of work (although, if it is like what exists for SpaceX, you'll own part of a fund that is comprised of 1% SpaceX stock and 99% other stuff). Literally 0 chance that all or even many current investors can remain as shareholders in the private company. "
:)
"Stock gets to 420 then Elon tweets ""oops, stock went up.  Talking to investors to see if we can buy at 500 instead"""
Agreed. Will be interesting to see how this plays out
It’s sometimes easier to find creditors for something like this than it is for a normal loan. And also Elon and Tesla are not synonymous. Either way the general rule is the general rule.

i sold all but 1 share.  so i still have it
I had solarcity shares but they converted to TSLA
thats what the representative on cnbc said. With and offical letter sent to employees on the tesla website this is now very much a legit thing. Question is will the shorts get achance to cover (because i have no idea)?
That's not how capitalism works..
"So does this private shareholder thing prevent shorts? No public shares to ""borrow."""
"Yeah but Amazon sells other people's products and Netflix does the same, but digitally. Tesla, meanwhile, is selling their own physical products. So, there are some major differences in the business models. And since they're not only building manufacturing buildings but also an infrastructure of superchargers, they've got costs that go way past what those other companies would.

Like I said, I'll be much more excited about them as a private company than I am currently with all of the stock market whim that impacts their value."
"I agree that the SEC investigation will probably not lead to anything (unless they uncover something else) but it is another entry in the negative ledger.

Musk wants to take Tesla private bc he doesn’t want to keep answering the same inconvenient questions from shareholders about the differences between his pronouncements and promises and the company’s products and performance. Also he wants to avoid government oversight and reporting requirements.  

This should be a warning to future investors including the Saudi’s who he says will take Tesla private. The company’s continued problems do not arise because the shareholders keep asking questions.  I don’t know why Musk thinks the Saudi’s won’t also be asking the same questions.



"
Ok thanks. You are right
So buying TSLA now would be the correct answer 😂 because he basically has to go through with it
I think I'm rooting for this 
"What are you talking about? He said he is still ""considering"" taking the action. This isn't an actual offer.

And what demands are you talking about? I didn't say anything about demands. He is certainly entitled to leak it, assuming it is legit, all I said is that it will cost him and his financiers a ton of money if he tweets about it in advance."
My understanding is Apple is buying back the shares from the current shareholders. Those shares belong to Apple now.
"This is real. 

https://www.tesla.com/blog/taking-tesla-private?redirect=no"
"Right, so at the end of the day, this is legitimate. Why would he announce this only to screw over shorts and not follow through, which would be illegal. Or he got hacked. But Tesla PR have not said anything thus far, that is really telling. In the past when there was something out there that maybe was not right, Tesla PR would almost immediately “shut it down” and back track on whatever happened. "
"Nope, not illegal "
">I didn't say anything about Elon cashing out. I just thought this was interesting that since Elon tweeted this there is certainly new interest in the stock. Say what you will, but investors read his tweets and buy and sell their stocks based on that. Elon's duty is to see that his investors make money and the stock price rises. This would only be illegal if Elon sold shares."
"> They can still accept investors but that's irrelevant.

Only if they are accredited.

> The long thesis will hold true even if the company is private. 

Didn't say it wouldn't.

> The only thing that changes is that the average Joe will only make a lot of money instead of huge amounts of money.

Not just the average Joe, but institutional investors as well since they would be selling their shares too."

"He said he was obtaining funding through local banks.  Sounds to me like this is going to be a Shanghai financed gigafactory.  Or maybe by ""local"" he meant Chinese in general."
Rather have China own part of Tesla than Tesla being shorted all the time by institutional investors.

I would guess that it’s the Chinese over the Saudis, though. "
Larry Page already told Musk he'll fund anything he wants to do for SpaceX because he wants to see space exploration succeed. The two are pretty good friends from what I've heard. So Page funding the buyout wouldn't be too surprising.

"> so everyone who bet that Tesla will drop will lose money.  
  
Sounds like something I'd read in /r/prorevenge  
Should we ask Elon to post his story in there?"
"
>So if Elon buys up all shares at the all time high nobody that shorted the stock will earn a cent. On top of this, short positions come with all sorts of extra costs so everyone who bet that Tesla will drop will lose money
>

What's confusing me is that you had to buy a stock back on a certain day, but now you can't. How does that affect your short?

Let's say you bought it at $100, sold, and Elon buys 100% of the stock back at $150. Do you then owe the person you bought it from $150? Doesn't it kind of invalidate the short because nobody knows what a fair price for that stock is anymore?"
Why does someone lend shares to someone to take an 80% loss in their initial investment? I'm lost. Please explain. I'm a dummy. 
"Uh no. Just think about it, if you immediately sold the shares for $100 how would you make money when the price drops?

 A short is borrowing shares from someone else. They lend it to you like a loan and then you pay them back at a later date at whatever price the shares are worth"
Why would a company want to turn a profit when they're expanding? They would be taxed on their profits. 
That isn't taking into account what happens when he sells the company in the far future and turns a profit.
"He keeps saying stuff like this, and has been wrong every time. Much of his rationale is based upon the conspiracy theory levels of nonsense, too.

Yet, he has the gift of the gab and is excellent at gish galloping his opponents -- so, he keeps getting invited to speak on various platforms to promote his thesis.

I guess he'll ride this one into the wall, and it'll be everyone else's fault."
"That's funny. 

After spending years trolling people, sending his psedonymous Twitter friends to hassle people, and generally being an aggressive and mean-spirited dick - he bails out when he heat is on him.

"Talking with the board, and informing the SEC isn't the same thing. If he bought any shares or anyone with this information did in the same period that is automatic insider trading."
"Indeed, I am sure there's plenty of money making, would not argue otherwise"
Musk bought about $50m of stock during the last what 3-4 months? It's insider trading 100%.
"> Who the fuck would purchase a risky asset, make it illiquid

How about many people who put shares of some companies into 401k/IRA accounts?  Sometimes people do buy & forget looking toward the long term rather than something which is on a day to day basis.  I can name all sorts of even small investments that are done that way... especially for something like starting up a restaurant or other small business such a practically any business on ""Main Street"" of a typical town.  If anything, these rules Tesla is suggesting are far more liquid than even those other kinds of franchise investments.

If you don't like this idea..... **SELL TSLA**.  Elon Musk is basically putting down a marker and letting you know ahead of time that times are changing.  I'm betting this is going to take from six months to a year to complete, so there will definitely be time to play the market in the meantime if that is what you want.  Day traders are not going to be welcome as investors in the company in the future though."

"The majors had jumped on a $7500/car federal subsidy train. It’s not clear how committed any of them are to electrification in the long run. Most of their efforts seem half-assed, at best.

"It is, but if he has gone through the steps to secure funding, he can show that as genuine intent, even if he doesn't go through with it.

It's really brilliant if it isn't true, or he decides not to, as it is causing a massive squeeze on the shorts right now as the stock briefly shot to 371, and is holding out around $365, about $22 more than opening.  As further evidence, Tesla usually trades about 1.73M shares a day, it is at 17.43M shares traded today..."
Most billionaires thrive because of iffy and gray areas.
"Yes: so either he is committing a crime or he is not.

What's your point?"
"Not even that - it's legal if he has a reasonable expectation that it can/will happen. He's within the bounds of legality if this is the case, even if TSLA *doesn't* wind up going private."
"But if it doesn't pass, then the stock price would drop to what they were before (or similar, depending on what other news/performance comes out) the news of a private move ever came about.  At that point, the shorts aren't any worse off than they are now.

The inflated price only happened because of the promise of $420. Once the vote happens and $420 is off the table, the stock price would retreat."
"It is, absolutely.  Personal finance and company growth are at odds often - this is why so many companies ruin their business following shareholder demands and lose focus on the future while chasing profits today."
"I mostly agree with this, but I do think it's kinda disheartening that, as a retail investor, I put my money on the line and have held on through risky periods only to be cut out from the lion's share of potential gains.

""Socialize the losses, privatize the gains"" seems to be what's happening here to some degree, or at least socialization of the risk and privatization of the rewards."
What’s yet to be seen is if the institutional investors share that same social conscience.
It doesn’t work that way. Most likely one of the investors that take the company private will open a public fund that had a piece of Tesla along with a bunch of other holdings and you’ll be able to buy units in the fund. 
"I would too, especially if it can be converted to Mars seats at some point.  When I go long, I go long."
If the stock reaches $420 this won't go through.  That price is the buyout and shareholders won't accept a buyout if the offer is a lowball.
"Looking at past short squeezes, they could lose much more than $13B.   Porsche was able to set almost $1000 share prices on shorts forced to cover VW making it the most expensive company ever at that time...  Shorts didn't get out fast enough then, and lost much more than they would have if they'd been fortunate enough to get out at a $0 cost basis.   Tesla can do the same, those forced to cover because they didn't get out soon enough pay whatever the unrealistic demanding price is because there is no other choice...    A cost basis of $0 could be overly optimistic."
420 dude!
That’s a new all time high
"Right? He is just throwing money away in order to hurt peoples' feelings? Feelings don't keep the lights on, yaknow?"
it's legal manipulation. it's a perk.
"As I understand it, no. The board *recommends** that the shareholders accept/reject a particular offer but ultimately it’s up to the shareholders. "
It says you can choose to remain a shareholder in private Tesla but you wouldn’t be able to sell on a stock exchange.
If the board agrees to sell it's not hostile. 
"That's not a hostile takeover, it's the normal way to take a company private. 

A hostile takeover is what IBM did to Lotus back in the day, they just started buying up controlling share at a premium price until they had control.

"
That wouldn’t solve Elon’s problem with public company shareholders - Apple would have to answer to Apple shareholders with regard to Tesla
"But that's how all mergers & acquisitions work. Buyer puts forth a price per share. Shareholders vote.

The trading price then quickly rises to the price per share which was agreed upon. As it's guaranteed profit for anyone who purchases for less than the agreed price."
"For the price to rise to 420$ (or any price for that matter), there has to be an investor willing to buy at that price. Who's going to buy a share at 420$ (let alone above 420$) on the hope of selling it later at the exact same (lower) price?"
You’re welcome. If this kind of thing interests you I’d recommend the movie Barbarians at the Gate with James Garner about the 80’s M&A boom and the takeover of RJR tobacco in particular. It’s a funny take and touches on these type of deals. 
Well you had a lot of people jump in today for an arbitrage opportunity. If Elon wakes up tomorrow and tweets “LOL JK” the stock will be back at $300 by lunchtime. 
"Got any money on that in options contracts, or are you just saying this to say it?"
"3 weeks maybe, 6 weeks definitely"
"BUY LIKE THE WIND, BULLSEYE"
"If this was the case. As an existing shareholder would i then be able to buy more shares in future, or would make current allocation be my lot forever?"
"But, pending some massive unforeseen news in the meantime, it won't do this. 

That's like bidding higher than the buy it now price on an Ebay item. 

I'm sure it will spike some more as news spreads. But people will get weary/greedy and sell for quick profit. Smart investors don't get absolutely burned over news like this... especially Elon tweets."
That's called market manipulation and could land him in jail... so probably not.
"You are most likely right - I believe the 'Private' price point is Elon's counter.

Bonus for possibly triggering a short squeeze. (of the Century)"
"Yes, but he also doesn't HAVE to sell the company, so there isn't any ""fending off the Saudi's"" currently.  If they wanted a hostile takeover, they would have to buy 50% plus one share to have a majority of the shares."
"Toyota doesn't want batteries, Tesla doesn't want fuel cells."
"Just went to a Tesla dealership to look at cars, and I gotta agree.  While the innovations and new gadgets make Teslas friggin awesome, it also lacks the preciseness of years of practice that traditional auto-makers have.

For example, on Model X, you can clearly see welding lines in the middle of the rear seat door frame, edges of window covers are folded inwards instead of being properly shaped, etc.  It doesn’t make the car any worse practically, but those small details also matter to a lot of people, and I think partnership with a traditional auto-maker would be very beneficial in increasing the overall quality of Teslas significantly."
They used to have one:  https://money.cnn.com/2017/06/05/investing/toyota-sells-tesla-stake/index.html
I doubt Toyota is going to be the one to buy back into Tesla again.
"So if he can just pick $420, what's to stop him from picking $250, less than the stock is going for now?"
Would that then mean he owns 100% of the shares after the fact?
"1.  He owns 20%.  He can't do this alone.
2.  $420 is a healthy premium, so the other stock holders are most likely going to approve.
3.  He's got a plan similar to what SpaceX has with Fidelity to convert people to indirect owners of the private company if they do not want to be bought out.  They'd still see their investment grow as Tesla does.

The only difference is the new structure won't allow short-selling or demand quarterly reports."
"Can't do that with only 51%, though."
If and only if the stock you own affords you voting rights. Not all stock holdings allow you to have a vote.
"That's the kicker, you win either way. There is really only 2 possible outcomes to this scenario if Elon is even SLIGHTLY serious. 

Outcome #1 (The one he's really hoping for) -- The price of his stock will sky rocket... it will completely DESTROY short sellers like we've never seen before. (You win because your personal stock just skyrockets)

Outcome #2 - (The price doesn't change because people don't think he's 100% serious). -- He buys out everyone's shares at X (420 or whatever) - Tesla goes private and he doesn't have to deal with FUD/Shorts. (You win because your guaranteed 420+ for your shares that you bought cheaper)

I mean... I hate to say it, but Elon usually follows through with what he attempts (or at least puts a really good effort into it). It looks like a MASSIVE buy signal for TSLA right now."
Elon said he would make a fund for people who don't sell.. wtf does that mean 
This isn't fair. I invested in them initially because I trusted in their vision and execution of that vision. And now they want me to just go away?
Who determines the amount? What stops them from setting the buyout price at $1?

"Musk’s shares will be sold too?

How does he then retain ownership of the company?  After sale is the board dissolved immediately and he would be the CEO with no way for anyone to kick him out?"
"That’s not the way it works at all. Private companies still have shareholders. Musk will still own his stake in Tesla directly. 

Private company’s just have limits on how many shareholders they can have and who those shareholders are. 

The advantage to Musk is that when you are under those thresholds you are not required to be listed on an exchange and your reporting requirements are dramatically simpler. 

So he gets rid of all the shenanigans with people trying to manipulate the share price and he can keep all his financial and production details out of the public eye.

How tf would that even work?  Would brokers even go for that?!
"~~Also, just because someone wants to buy the shares doesn’t mean you have to *sell* them. Not even if the board says “Yup, this buyout is all on the up and up”. ~~

Edit: My mistake: apparently if 50% of the votes agree to the sale, then they *do* have to sell. "
"If that’s the case, doesn’t that make it all the more likely that the vote won’t fail? Basically vote it down and tank your shares or vote for it and get $420 a share. To vote against it, you would have to be in the position that you want to hold Tesla long but prefer it to stay public. Any other position and it would be in your interest to vote to go private. "

Interesting. I own Tesla shares in a TFSA account (I'm in Canada). Hopefully this Tesla fund can be bought and sold in a TFSA as well.
Ooooohh the SEC.  You sound a little short.
"Shorts tried to warn politicians and the public about the bubble but nobody wanted to listen to them. Jim Chanos, this subreddit's favorite enemy, tried to convince the leaders of the world that a financial crisis was imminent and they had to act fast to soften the blow. He showed them the evidence and they ignored him. 

If anything, the housing crisis showed what happens when people are uncritically fed the bull theories until everybody buys into them. Short selling incentivises people to find out when something doesn't add up. Especially these days it's becoming more and more important as companies, especially in the tech sector, are increasingly dishonest and the idea of 'fake it until you make it' is becoming dangerously common. Basically short sellers are necessary for a market to exist and thrive most when everybody else is too blinded by their greed to take a step back and distance themselves from the narrative. "

This doesn't help at all. It still says he hasn't decided right there at the top. 
"I agree with you to an extent. Especially now that he seems to be doubling down with more tweets.

If I were to wager a guess, I would say that this is a legit takeover attempt but perhaps he jumped the gun and announced it before the paperwork was finalized (so to speak).

If the sec and nasdaq had already been made properly aware of this, I doubt we would be seeing this halt right now. I think it would have been halted sooner honestly.

Either way, the guy who claimed this was done just to screw the shorts and there is no real intent to do it, is completely wrong.

EDIT: Teslas new tweet about a decision not being made yet is not helping Elon out here. Makes him look in the wrong again. "
"Let’s look at this. Yeags said Musk is doing this •to increase the stock price and •to make money. Meaning he’d be selling his stocks at a higher price. Yeags also said Musk would not follow through, meaning that his tweet would have been a lie.

Pump and dump is an illegal practice in the stock market, where false or misleading statements are made to increase a stock’s value, and then the person pumping it sells a bunch of stock when it gets high enough, making a tidy profit. If Musk 

•Wanted the stock to go up and

•Wanted to sell stock when it goes up in order to make money and

•Was not planning on actually doing this

then he would fit the definition of a pump and dump scheme. Which is, like I said, illegal. "
">Quick way to raise a shit load of cash.

Sounds like you expected him to get money "
"What's your point exactly?

If Tesla goes private every single investor will make money. Some investors will still be able to invest in a private Tesla and the rest will move on or invest in companies that are invested in Tesla."
I’ll gladly hug Elon’s Nuts. I’ve always bet on him and now I’m laughing all the way to the bank. $420 a share! Suck it haters.

"[This video at 25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LlqOm7xVaU?t=25m25s) (beware: in German) from an owner in Germany shows it charging 37.8% slower than a Tesla X and using 25% more energy at ~~highway speeds~~ German Highway Speeds, so ~80mph.  

The I-pace is supposed to use PM motors all around without any induction motors (induction motors can ""torque sleep"" which might be the culprit of the efficiency hit).

The power usage and the charging rate would suggest that the I-Pace can only drive 1 hour on a 30 minute charge, which would be pretty horrendous.

To backtrack on my statements, Tesla has been able to achieve quite a bit of extra efficiency through OTA updates, so there's no reason we should assume Jaguar won't be able to do the same.  However, due to the dealership model, those updates will most require the car to go in for service.

Edit: The I-pace might be a great car for some people, for a high-end commuter.  But I don't see it being an option for a lot of Americans because it's absolutely crippled as a long range vehicle or a sales force vehicle.  That said, I do hope that the results get better, I'm a supporter of all BEVs, not just a Tesla fanboy.

"The lender will usually be someone that holds on to stock for a long time, so they have the stocks sitting around, a guarentee that they will get the same number of shares back, and if the price doesn't drop, they make money. For the lender its pretty much a win win if they weren't intending to sell even in the event the stock trends downward"
"The shortseller has to pay interest to the person that lends the shares, so there's a sort of time limit. So the lender wins if the share goes up  or stays the same, or even if it doesn't go down far enough.

'Hitting' 420?
"GM[1] says that their future is ""all electric"". You don't need to make an announcement like that to get federal electricity subsidies. These companies are global businesses that plan a decade ahead. U.S. subsidies only go so far.

> If you had to pick one company to target in an effort to stop electrification, taking into consideration both the impact that company is having and how easy it would be to disrupt their progress, which company would you pick? 

I wouldn't pick any one because taking out one company will make no difference at all. It would be a lot smarter to just invest in them and then you win no matter which direction the market goes.

"It's completely fair because you agreed to those terms when you invested in the first place. If you didn't know about this possibility, then you have your own finance education and self to blame. 

GOOG did this to me when they bought Motorola. It happens every day and is exactly how the markets are ""supposed"" to work. They don't care *why* you invested, and you shouldn't expect them to care about the individual stock holder's wishes, especially if the Board thinks that following those wishes would bankrupt the company (for example).

What you're saying is that you think the only fair way for this to operate is for you, the single, individual shareholder, to have total veto power over all company decisions. 

That isn't going to happen for a lot of reasons, the primary one being that chaos would abound if you got your ""fair"" way of handling your shares.

Deciding such a thing by majority the fairest way to do it. There are millions of shareholders and voting is the only way to achieve consensus."
"You get a vote proportional to your shares, and so does everyone else. So if you can convince people that its against their interests, it won't go through."
"> This isn't fair.

Yet you agreed to it when you purchased the shares?  It's not fair or unfair.  It just is - and you should have known what you were agreeing to in the first place, arguably."
investing isn't and has never been fair. Whoever has the most shares can decide to do whatever they want with the company. that is the nature of Capitalism... *shrug*
[deleted]
Shareholders vote.
No shareholder will vote for a buyout at $1
"A majority of the shareholders would never agree to sell their shares that low, so it wouldn't pass and wouldn't happen. "
The people voting.
"The group buying out the company.

Shareholders are unlikely to vote for a buyout that is less than the current share price (and if they do, I'm sure the SEC will have fun investigating). Usually the buyout share price is higher than the current market price, so theoretically, Musk could do the buyout tomorrow at $420 even though the stock is trading in the three-hundreds."
"Musk’s shares will be sold.  Every shareholder will receive cash for their stock, without exception.  To be a part of the new ownership group, Musk will borrow billions of dollars to fund the purchase of Tesla and then pay back those borrowed billions with the billions he makes from the sale of Tesla.  The net effect will be that Tesla will become a private company and Musk will retain about the same percentage ownership of the company.

The new owners will have the right to install their own CEO and set their own corporate structure.  Almost certainly, the new structure would be far friendlier to Elon’s interests."
">Private company’s just have limits on how many shareholders they can have

No such restriction exists.  That's a misconception as it's really a limit on the practicality on the number of shareholders in a privately held company.  After 2,000 shareholders, there are registration and disclosure requirements that are similar to those of publicly traded companies.

>he can keep all his financial and production details out of the public eye.

They'll have to find a way to get under the 2,000 shareholders for the reasons I mentioned above.  Musk may not care as much about this information being public as he does about the ability of speculators influencing the company.  I can see a scenario where Tesla is content to de-list with tens of thousands of shareholders.

>That’s not the way it works at all.

What I described is, in fact, exactly the way it works usually works.  This buyout will probably be structured a bit more creatively.  Musk also mentioned something where a fund is created to allow access to allow proxy investing in Tesla.  Even that case, the fund could not be just an SPE whose only holding is Tesla unless it was sold exclusively to accredited investors.  It will likely be a mutual fund with some portion of its holdings being private Tesla.

It'll be interesting to see what this plan is.  It's likely going to be different than most buyouts of public companies which are purchased by small investment groups or other corporations with some combination of cash, debt and equity."
"Not in the slightest. The world is going to need immense amounts of energy storage to move to renewables (something like 200 years worth of GF1 output), and Tesla got the ball rolling to get that battery production primed (with expensive luxury vehicles that need vast quantities of batteries)."
"I'm holding these shares on my own, as my broker wouldn't even touch Tesla without waivers when I started with them a couple of years back. At this point, I'm going to try and hold on to my shares with a ""propietary fund,"" as soon as that's available. I'm going as long as possible with Tesla."
"The problem is, you have no idea the agenda of the people holding shares.  An investment firm may very well want to tank the shares so they can buy another 10% of the company on the cheap.  "
"You're trying so hard to make yourself look like you don't attack people constantly that you hallucinate things that don't exist.  This week's news must be getting to you, I hope you'll be OK when it's all said and done! 

If you're disagreeing with me, is it because you assume everyone that every critic of Tesla is a troll?  "
"> everyone who criticizes Tesla must be a troll

That's your absolute assumption.  Don't assume everyone who criticizes Tesla must be a troll, and don't strawman your assumptions onto others when you want to create arguments.   And if you don't believe what you say, don't say them.  "
"I hear ya, it’s nice no one will be forced to sell either way, I think the company will be worth more than $70 billion personally, so I’m holding"
To be fair I'm pretty sure Obamas tweets are there too
Everyone can speak openly. Speaking openly doesn't mean there aren't consequences. 
"Stock manipulation is typically *false* information, think pump and dump schemes. If the stock is being driven higher by real good faith plans being announced then it's legal. If Musk has no intention of going private and that can be proven in court then it's stock manipulation and it's a big no-no."
"It's no more stock manipulation than announcing a new product is. You can publicly say things, there's nothing wrong with that. 

This definitely falls on the edge of that spectrum, but it is allowed. "
Are you being willfully obtuse or...?
"Yeah, I'm interested too, I'm in Poland and bought some shares here through a local investment office, but I'm not very optimistic about being able to invest in that new fund... I guess we'll have to wait and see."
same here.  tfsa
I don't buy options or shorts... 
"Shorting also incentivizes them to do everything they can to ensure their bet pays off.

An investor in a company will try to ensure it does well.

A short will try to ensure it does not."
"Thanks for adding. I think the ""*betting against*"" rhetoric, which some perpetuate, is an oversimplification and completely screwed up the public perception of how it works. Another way to see it is as a preservation of value; instead of value disappearing when a stock declines, you can collect the difference and reinvest it. "
Why would I be against a put?
"That's not true. I just changed it. It didn't need any ""approval"" and no ""bunch of other things""."
"""Shifts,"" i.e. after starting off with business models that were fairly different from Tesla's. I'm not saying Tesla won't succeed; Quite the opposite, I hope they succeed since I'm personally invested in them. I'm just saying I'll feel more comfortable when Elon is making decisions solely based on the long term future of the company, not what's going to keep stock prices strong for the next 3 months only. I have a lot of faith in him and in the mission of Tesla, and I hope to never need to buy a car from another brand. I'll be thrilled if he can get the company back private for a while. "
"My point is that those two companies still have very different models than Tesla. Yes, there is still more room for Tesla to create new revenue streams, but if your argument is ""but Netflix and Amazon started making their own products once they were insanely profitable"" only highlights how different they are."

"Current shareholders don't ""own"" the shares bought back by Apple. They sold the shares back to Apple.

Am I missing something here? If I own 10 stocks of AAPL, then AAPL bought those shares from me, I now have 0 shares. Why would I get compensation if Apple goes private after they bought those shares from me? Only those that still ""own"" AAPL shares will get compensation."

I had three separate things above.  To which one are you referring?

> If Tesla goes private every single investor will make money. Some investors will still be able to invest in a private Tesla and the rest will move on or invest in companies that are invested in Tesla.

"No, you're right.  There are a lot of people who get defensive for the German car manufacturers around here who think they can probably do electric cars better than Tesla because, well, they're established German car companies.  How can their product not be better?  They don't realize that Tesla's superior engineering, battery tech, motor tech, full-on commitment to EVs and the support networks they require, as well as their unique vision will keep them well ahead of the competition for decades.  They don't realize that massive sunk losses in ICE tech will keep all ICE company boards trying to delay the day of EV reckoning for as long as possible and thus prevent them from adequately committing to EVs until it's too late.  It's already too late, probably.  There are no Tesla killers right now, nor are there any coming in the foreseeable future."

Are you always this antagonistic?  Is it really that necessary to be a troll?  Calm down here please.  I would like a civil discussion rather than one which degenerates into name calling which this seems apt to become.  I am presuming that you want to continue a civil discussion so please don't prove me wrong.

I get what you are saying about liquidity, but it is very much an individual investing philosophy that is involved with here.  On the other hand, from a business perspective does it make sense to encourage people who are looking for a long term gains as opposed to people more interested in the short term.

As Elon Musk pointed out, the rules he is proposing here is already what is being done with SpaceX and The Boring Company.  It is possible that after this is all said and done with though that you will need to become an accredited investor before buying more shares of Tesla and other rules which will apply.  I literally don't know if small investors will be forced to sell if this deal goes through.

> it is literally damaging to my financial interests

Which is why you are likely so passionate about this topic.  Fortunately if you have dropped out of holding the stock you might be able to look more objectively at the company.  Buyout offers like this aren't something you should necessarily be thinking about what the price of the stock is going to be next week unless you are trying to get into the arbitrage following the announcement."

"Shareholders vote on the price.  If you're holding shares worth $430 and someone offers you less for it, you vote no.  If you're holding shares worth less than $420 but think the price will go higher, you vote no.

Going private is good for the company, bad for the individual shareholder (for a very vague definition of bad, if you're long on Tesla this price is very low and not going to sway your vote)."
"The world and power revolves around money. People frequently kill people for less than a million dollars. Instead of sneaking around and slowly stockpiling enough shares purchased at a low price, he is announcing very informally that he would like to buy shares at a MUCH higher price. Instantly any savings found in buying stocks at market value were washed down the drain and the other party that is partnering with him is losing A LOT of money. If he would have announced it properly, the stocks wouldn’t have jumped in value and the other party could have bought the shares much cheaper. So he shafted the other party that is going to help him take the company private in order to get his sweet revenge on ‘shorts’. It seems reckless but I may be totally misunderstanding this (most likely)."
"that's why he hates being a public co. i don't blame him. though he can be a bit of annoying, he's not stupid."
So what if 90% of shareholders decide to sell their stock to Elon Inc? The board has no power to stop the sale. 
And how do you know he has blindsided the board?

Toyota got free and clear of the albatross in 2016.  
"The Tesla drivetrain would increase the costs of a Lexus significantly. Batteries are super expensive. Considering that they have 6000-7000 cells per car, they don't make nearly as much as the traditional automaker on the base model 3.

If you take into account that both Tesla and Toyota will need to make a hefty profit on developing a new platform for the Tesla drivetrain, the car will likely be as expensive as the Model X, if not more.

Announcing a shared platform car would likely cannibalize car sales from both of their platforms as well.

It's more likely that Tesla and Toyota announce a partnership for Tesla to develop a hybrid drivetrain for Lexus and for Tesla to use Lexus parts for a reduced price, as well as provide assistance with manufacturing and interior design."

These are Elon fanboys we are talking about...

What happens then to all the shorts? Guessing they’d owe $420 per share?
Yea but like TD Ameritrade and many other major brokers allow you to buy the stock now.  How would I buy more once TSLA is private? Would TD Ameritrade even do that?
"Well the flip side is, Elon is obviously voting for, so of the remaining votes, under 78%, he only needs slightly more than 1 out of 3 to vote in his favor.

It could last another 3 days or another 15 years, I don't know, but eventually you have to make a profit or declare bankruptcy. Eventually the hype wears off and the stock price will start to correct. We don't know when, but we know it will... eventually.

Also, corporations have a legal obligation to shareholder value. I think it's not even legal to make a corporation with no intention of *ever* turning a profit. "

"Wait, you are suggesting that Musk bought a miniscule portion of his company 3-4 months ago on the basis of knowing that he and other investors would be paying an absurd premium for all of the company 3-4 months later? This might be the dumbest thing posted here today. Musk bought those shares to show confidence at a time of weakness.  

For that to be insider trading, agreements would have to be signed to do a buyout, and a price set, prior to his share purchases. As stated today, the buyout price is based on a premium over the share price post-Q2 earnings. Obviously these prospective investors weren't committed back when Musk was buying shares or they could have bought in at a lot less. If anything, he's doing things exactly right by setting the buyout price after all material info is known (i.e. right after earnings, which is when he last bought shares) "
You have no idea of what you speak.

On the other hand, from a business perspective does it make sense to encourage people who are looking for a long term gains as opposed to people more interested in the short term.

I understand this. Given the choice all businesses would prefer to be private, as there are much lower regulatory and compliance costs. This along with other advantages make it compelling to stay private. 

The issue isn't with TSLAs desire, however, it's with any buyers. Buyers often take businesses private as a buyout in order to turn them around and then resell them (private equity). Either that or absorb them. The issue is that it is almost inconceivable that someone would take a risky asset like TSLA private because of its operating concerns. 
> As Elon Musk pointed out, the rules he is proposing here is already what is being done with SpaceX and The Boring Company.

They are not really 'the rules' for those companies. They are just private companies and to buy stock in a private company you need to be an accredited investor. As for existing stockholders, I'll reiterate, you cannot do a buyout without selling all of the shares. Otherwise it is just a market transaction. 


>Which is why you are likely so passionate about this topic.

I'm only short 2 shares of TSLA, I don't think it's making a material impact on my assessment. My question for you is do you think that it is OK that Elon repeatedly makes false and misleading claims which drive the stock price. This is illegal and if the SEC had any balls they would be enforcing the law. "

But you said, It is BRILLIANT if it isn't true in your second paragraph.  You put that stupidity out there, stand behind it.

Claiming he has the funding secured is what would bring about the class action.  I don't think anyone had doubts Musk would like to take the company private before the tweet.  The news is that he has investors lined up willing to put that much equity in at such a high price.
Thanks for this info!
"Shareholders can sell to whomever they want. That's not the issue. The issue is taking the company private.

What a 90% shareholder would do is vote for a new board that would approve the move."
Otherwise I'm pretty sure we'd have a very carefully crafted press release instead of a dopey tweet.
Such as the Saudi Sovereign Wealth Fund?
"Yes. I put the buy order in this morning. Only 45 shares because I wasn't expecting to need liquidity, but whatever."
"I assume there would still be a secondary market for shares with this many floating around in the hands of private investors, Tesla just wouldn't have the obligations that a public company has. In terms of investing it might be almost exactly the same. "
"Exactly.  Like I said, others said hostile takeover. That'd be incredibly stupid of them to do and somehow think they can do better than musk."
I'm not an expert but I believe there are regulations against this.
The statement that he has secured funding for a buyout at $420 per share would be the actionable item.  That is also where the skepticism is coming from - he would need to have commitments for tens of billions of dollars from investors to purchase the stock at a huge premium on top of the stock's already lofty valuation.  That is a gigantic equity check.  I am super curious to know who his investors are.

"Ethically they would be buying back the shares at above current market value, not just disappearing your shares and making you go away. I understand people originally investing because they believe in the company and it's vision, but it's not like they would really be screwing you over here."
"A take-private offer from a controlling shareholder requires the approval of a majority of the minority shareholders. So Musk (who owns about 23 percent of Tesla stock and has dominion over others holding more stock, I believe) would not count toward the 51 percent of disinterested shareholders that would have to approve the deal.

Or something."
"In the UK, the board and the CEO have legal responsibilities to protect the interest of minority shareholders. I presume that’s the same in the US. 

It is obvious that interests of minority shareholders are not protected if they are forced to sell at anything lower than market price. 

It probably gets more tricky if they’re forced to sell at, say, $420. There will be people (already some in the comments) who’d say “I thought it would go to $1000 and so you forced me to sell cheap”"
That's how you end up in jail.  
So stay an investor when they go private
He would be sued for failing to maintain shareholder value which is a fiduciary responsibility of a public business and its management team.
There are rules that protect minority shareholders from inequitable decisions by the majority.  There would be a class action requesting the majority purchase the remaining shares at a court-decided price.
Yep.
"If Ameritrade allows you to buy Fidelity or the like, I assume you should be able to.

*See Elon's tweet about creating a private fund like they did with Fidelity and SpaceX.*"
"If it was a sure thing he would have done it already.  It's not a coincidence he started buying up shares right after that ""nothing-burger"" vote on whether he should be removed as chairman.  A lot of people that have been long on Tesla stand to lose a lot of money if it goes private.  "
"I forgive you, things will get better and I hope you pull through these hard times a better person because of it.

"Not so, it's normal for a market to halt trading on a stock on the release of material news. It doesn't mean the market determined the release to not be allowed.

In my defense buyouts usually don't allow stock holders to retain shares when the company goes private.  Will be interesting to see how this will work.

Again, I didn't say it did."
"> As I mentioned, they can still accept investors and Musk has pretty much confirmed it.

From Elon's blog post today:

Good good human bot bot.
Is Tesla now part Saudi Arabian? No... this is a stupid argument
"> Wait, you are suggesting that Musk bought a miniscule portion of his company 3-4 months ago on the basis of knowing that he and other investors would be paying an absurd premium for all of the company 3-4 months later? This might be the dumbest thing posted here today. Musk bought those shares to show confidence at a time of weakness.

**IF** he had knowledge of the impending ""going private"" when he bought that stock (and he must have, these things don't come out of thin air) then that was *insider trading*.

>As stated today, the buyout price is based on a premium over the share price post-Q2 earnings.

When was that stated? 

"
It would appear that i do.
"> They are not really 'the rules' for those companies.

Sure they are rules.  As in the articles of incorporation and what they say about how investors can interact with each other.  I'll grant that it is also SEC rules for investment as well.  Shareholders can make up other silly rules like being able to complete the Boston Marathon or some other standard... as long as it gets passed in a shareholder meeting.  For the most part though a company generally wants to keep such rules out since their goal is to cast as wide of a net of investors as possible.

This action is definitely going to require Elon Musk standing before shareholders at a major shareholder meeting and getting their express approval since it will be amending the corporate charter, in addition to the market transaction.  While 50%+1 of the shareholders is all that is strictly necessary, it would be better if a supermajority went along with the motion.

What I've since found is that apparently the small investors are going to be moving into a mutual fund that will be expressly for current small TSLA share holders that will be acting on their behalf as an accredited investor.  How much of that fund will be publicly traded is going to be interesting and more details will likely need to be disclosed.

> I'll reiterate, you cannot do a buyout without selling all of the shares.

But you can withdraw from the market, which is ultimately what Mr. Musk is proposing to do here.  It may be a ""buyout"" in the sense that perhaps a completely new corporate charter will be created that falls under the private company rules instead, but you don't need to sell 100% of the shares other than on paper.

He is letting those who want to get out early the ability to do so without them losing any skin in the game... excepting those shorting the stock.

> My question for you is do you think that it is OK that Elon repeatedly makes false and misleading claims which drive the stock price. This is illegal and if the SEC had any balls they would be enforcing the law.

Do I think that Elon Musk has far too many people who give him a pass and lets him get away with things that otherwise he would not be able to do?  Some aspects of his personal life are sort of out of whack compared to mere mortals and it is possible that he is getting out of touch with the way his employees have been impacted by some of his decisions.  There is certainly plenty of room to criticize the guy and I don't think he is any kind of saint.

One of the reasons I personally don't use Twitter is precisely because of the stuff both he and Donald Trump (who has been compared to Elon Musk today due to their mutual use of Twitter)  have been doing over stuff that should use a little more thought before pressing the send button.  I sure hope for his sake in this matter that something far more substantive is going to be released in the next couple of days and that this is an action which has been months in developing rather than an off the cuff remark due to something said at the gym last night by a close buddy.

This definitely has the potential to royally screw Elon Musk if he hasn't done his homework.  If this has just been pulled from his ass hoping that the angel investors are going to magically show up after making that kind of tweet, he is going to be serving time at a federal prison.  That will also take down just about all of his companies too."
It is true he is considering it.  He said he is considering it. Nothing more or less.  Not a lie either.  You can either risk your money on a consideration or wait for a concrete statement.

There are people who have long positions in TSLA because they believe it’s worth $1,000 or more right now. They wouldn’t sell if the market price reached $420 organically, so how are their interests protected if they’re forced to sell for $420 by other shareholders?"
"So if not $420, what amount would land Elon in jail? $410? $375? $350? $250?

Other folks have provided an answer that makes more sense to me: the folks doing the buying don’t get to vote; the majority of the minority holders who are being bought out have to agree. "

"The more I learn about stock and commodities trading (thank you early days of crypto) the more I realize that capitalism has more in common with ecology than it does with physics. 

Wherever there is an exploitable resource (in this case banking on a company failing) there will be organisms that flood in to consume the resource. 

In this case, parasitic shorts and those who place them. 

The thing is, parasites absolutely have a place in a healthy ecology, they force the organism species to adapt a defense or perish. 

Without predators, parasites included, prey species would breed out of control and take over an unhealthy degree of resources (Apple anyone?). 

The _real_ danger to prosperity is actually monocultures, just like it is in ecology. And capitalism in its current de facto form grinds upwards towards monocultures constantly. 

And monocultures are quite easy for parasites to wipe out. This is why we won't have any more bananas in about 20-30 years. 

Maybe the same can be said about unethical shorts. "
I don't agree i wanted tesla to do well in the long term future. But if you buy stock at 180 to 360 dollars it might be a good idea to short.  it went to 370 after and down to 300 meaning in the short term you can make money.  Just look at the guys that did the big short in 2008-2009 and made millions shorting the housing bubble because other people were ignorant.

"Stated here: 
https://www.tesla.com/blog/taking-Tesla-private 

The difference is that having a goal or plan or general idea is not material information. I mean, Tesla plans on making their cars self driving and they are undoubtedly way further along then the public knows, but that doesn't mean execs have to spill every company secret every time they want to buy stock. Now if they reach an agreement with investors to sell, or make a major breakthrough in finalizing something like full self driving, and then buy stock, it's an issue. But 3-4 months is an enternity for Tesla. I doubt this was more than just a pipe dream until recent weeks when Elon finally stepped away from the production line. "
"As far as I know, it is already for years that he says he would like to have Tesla private like SpaceX (I think it was also in the book by Ashley Vance).

Therefore it is more the moment which could be due to something changing now. For all we know, it could be that the deal for the money was only settled yesterday. "

"For what it's worth, he has indicated he's in favor of a provision for just that reason.  What that means, exactly, and what the terms are, remain to be seen.

My two cents - let the dust settle before worrying too much.  

To be fair, I entirely understand wanting to believe in the company's mission and support it financially.  However, as an investor, it shouldn't be a complete shock that he might be in favor of something like this.  First, his other large company is private and it's clear he prefers things that way.  Further, it's undeniable how frustrated he's become with shorts and bears.  So while this is big news no matter how you dice it, it's not a complete shock.  To that end, if you really believe in the mission, once you can get past your personal financial stake (which should be profitable for you at the buyout price we're talking about, or with the generous option to go private with them) you should probably also support this, as it's arguably in the best interests of the company.  It's going to be difficult enough for them to continue to compete against the entrenched and well-monied energy players, so to rid themselves of the existential threat posed by shorts and the threat to their own vision by ceding to short-term thinking to keep the market happy...seems like a wise decision if it can be done correctly."
"I agree with you there, but that's kind of just the way it works. He did say something about letting people keep their shares instead, but I have no idea how that would work out."
That’s why I’m saying it is tricky. I guess it is for a court to decide if 420 was fair?
"There are fiduciary duties of care, loyalty and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

For this reason, take-private offers from controlling shareholders require the approval not of a majority of all stock, but a majority of the disinterested stockholders, meaning Musk's holdings wouldn't count toward the vote."

No, it is not. In that ""email"" ""Elon"" aka his legal department wrote:

>Either they can stay investors in a private Tesla or they can be bought out at $420 per share, which is a 20% premium over the stock price following our Q2 earnings call (which had already increased by 16%).

That does not mean that the number ""420"" was decided upon in the way you claimed. It is *not* based ""on a premium over the share price post-Q2 earnings"". It just happened to be that way because Musk woke up saw ""SAUDIS!"" popped another lude and twittered 420 because he likes weed.

Let's say that Apple only had 3 million shares outstanding, and you're one of 3 owners who each have 1 million shares.

If Apple buys all your shares for $1, the other shareholders clearly come out ahead.  They just went from owning 1/3 of the company each, to 1/2 of the company each, and the value of the company was not significantly impacted by the loss of the $1.

Obviously, in a realistic buyback scenario they're going to have to offer you a much more generous deal for a company of Apple's value, but it's still possible for the existing shareholders to come out ahead if the stock seems undervalued."

They didn't go camping trips to Yosemite, living on bologna sandwiches like my friends and I did when we were in school. They went to Europe, the Islands (name one), the Old Country, etc. 

There I was, in my 40s, and I've never even been to stinkin' Hawaii. I wondered if these kids had any idea, really, of how exceptional their lives, and their parents' lives, were? 

It was great school, and the kids were sweethearts, but I have certainly lived and worked among a contrast in incomes in my lifetime. "

Of course he was. Since when is the absolute difference between ages important? There's a world of difference between 10 and 15. It's probably more significant than the change from 25 to 40.

"I agree, that was a stupid word."
"Definitely true.

>In 2011, only one Tesla had ever been stolen in the U.S. That was four years after Tesla produced its first model, the Tesla  Roadster, and one year after the company went public. The number of  these electric cars being stolen has steadily increased every year along  with production: 6 in 2013, 15 in 2014, 9 in 2015, 28 in 2016, 57 in  2017 and 23 from January to May 2018. And yet almost every stolen Tesla  over those years has been recovered — all except 3, including that sole  Tesla stolen in 2011. (Tesla did not respond to request for comment.)  
>  
>The recovery of stolen Teslas is notable in an industry where the  overall recovery rate for stolen vehicles was just 58.4% in 2016. Tesla  had a 100% recovery rate that year, thanks in part to its GPS tracking  technology.

Who would have thought that compulsory gps tracking and the ability to remotely kill your car could keep it from being stolen / help recover it.... I mean pretty much the only way to keep it hidden is to immediately disable the 12v electrical system and most people dumb enough to steal a car aren't smart enough to understand it.

Nearly 100%... that's like being kinda pregnant.
Why would you say “nearly” if it’s 100% ?? I’m confussssed
Nearly 100-less Nick.
"But seriously, couldn’t you just put a single 18650 next to the GPS/LTE and, if power is cut, send an SOS with location immediately to Tesla HQ? It could probably keep pinging location for days. You could even have it be a completely separate chip embedded in the battery pack that only comes alive if the other power is cut. 

"
Same thought I always have on this topic.  What's to stop a thief (once they gain access to the car) from turning off the data connection in the settings?  This whole concept of Teslas can easily be tracked assumes that the driver doesn't know how to turn off the data connection.
They can't steal a Tesla as it's so connected like a computer.
In Europe Tesla's are stolen because it can take several months waiting for spare parts to be shipped from the U.S.
"I agree that the GPS tech has helped a lot and I know this is a percentage, but there still is only a small sample size to work with. I think 3 years from now would be a much better time to see the numbers. I do believe they will be much higher than the AVG, but further from 100%. "
So 99%..?
Probably because they all had to visit that single station that allows them to recharge.

If you somehow drive until the battery is ""empty"" the car still has enough brick protection to broadcast its position over the mobile connection for several months.  "
"In most if not all of the competitions vehicles, gps tracking is on a seperate circuit board sourced from a 3rd party supplier while on a Tesla, all that tech is deeply embedded on the integrated circuits and probably a LOT harded to remove or disable.  

But that also raises questions about privacy and the safety of your personal driving data.  If Tesla can almost always track a thief they definitely always know where you are.

It's basically sayone how someone broke into a car to disable anti-theft so they could steal it later."
"Not much actually.

Even though there are some tracking devices that use other frequencies to communicate and guestimate their location it's really easy to buy a jammer for a couple hundreds of dollars/euros and jamm pretty much everything in and around the car.

Your best bet is to protect the car so they can't drive it away. If they can't drive it away the only way to steal it is to use a tow truck which won't happen unless they really want your car (it is rare, expensive, etc). This is also why I really want Tesla to add a simple PIN protection to the car so only the owner can put it into drive."
"> Edit: I don't really know what I'm expecting, tbh. If thieves are using GPS jammers, what can you do to find it?

Meh, if you can't find it and it's going to be written off as a total loss, I'd rather Tesla be able to issue a command for thermal management to melt down the vehicle."
A big part of it though is that garages are super uncommon in the UK compared to the rest of the world on account of our small houses. Even less common are garages sufficiently large to fit a Model S/X and still get in/out easily that aren't also full of random crap.
"Funny you mention South Africa, because someone who lives nearby in the UK had their Land Rover Defender stolen, and they found the engine of it six years later there! "
"I don't know about the UK, but here in Portugal the latest trend is to steal M-sport steering wheels from BMWs.

They don't even bother taking the cars anymore, just open it up using some keyless entry spoof technique and take the most pricey and easily sold parts. The wheels can go for more than 1500€ in the used market."
What's passive entry? I hate that anyone can walk in on me in the car and open the door. 
"Not quite, it's a rolling code so you can't just do a replay attack - what happens is they use a receiver and a transmitter to boost the signal strength in-situ. The car then thinks the key is inside and allows it to be started up.

Thankfully you can just disable passive entry which thwarts the entire thing since that requires a button press on the keyfob itself."
It’s an aftermarket body kit. I’ve seen it before.

"Antwerp isn’t part of the US… well there are probably a dozen Antwerp’s in the US, but they don’t have the “Port of Antwerp” 😀

"It can actually be quite easy. A few Tesla’s have recently been stolen in the Netherlands without a trace, except for one. One appeared in a van trying to cross the German border. Some European thieves seem to understand the technology and how to bypass it, by for example driving a car into a container to subdue GPS and 3G/LTE connectivity, and then disassembling the car. By opening up the dashboard and removing the SIM card, you can already disable the connectivity of the 3G/LTE system. The car is no good for anything else other than parts, but you can successfully steal a Tesla.

"No, your random thief will be caught.  But anyone out to purposely steal a tesla for parts will succeed no matter the country.

"No, see, that's really dangerous. "
"I guess so.. it's hard to know the reasons for sure. There does seem to be a fair mix though still of just general hooliganism (see just how many Fiesta ST's are stolen to be joyridden) but also more serious crime - like people getting attacked in their homes for Range Rovers, high end Audi's, etc. I'll never own a car like that as long as I live anywhere near big cities as they just seem to be desirable to the worst kind of crime. Not trying to be xenophobic here but I think a lot of that is down to more serious Eastern European criminals. 

I did own a MK7 Fiesta ST.. parked it on the street a fair amount until in January 2017 I had the windows put through and attempted theft via OBD override.. thankfully the OBD port fuse was removed (presumably by Ford at a previous service) so they left empty handed but left me with both front windows put through and various other bits of damage presumably out of spite. Fun times. "
"Passive entry means that if the key is in range, the car will be unlocked without you having to do anything. If you also have auto-present handles switched on, this means that the handles also pop out when you walk up to it.

It was really cool until someone figured out they could amplify the signal from the peoples' keys while they were inside their houses..."

"Unless people commute to work 100 miles away, they aren't at half charge.  Even if they were at half charge, you probably aren't taking it to a chop shop even 150 miles away.


> I pentest these as a living. Either way, I wouldn't expect it to get far anyways. They're wildly insecure.

Have any proof for those claims?  Other than a key fob relay, can you show that a Tesla has been hacked?


>If I can track it, I dont see why the owner couldn't. 

ofc owners can track it, that's why the recovery rates are so high.  You can pull it up on your phone and see exactly where it is.  But that wasn't your argument; you said the reason why they weren't going to get very far was because they ran on a battery (and you now ninja edited your post I see).

Solution: All Tesla models will be outfitted with anti theft flare guns that fire when main power is cut
The whole part of security is to make it slightly harder to steal a Tesla than the comparatively valuable car next to it. You'll never get to 100% security.
"This could make the Y and future Teslas even more secure. With no 12V, feeding directly from the pack, there could be redundant wiring and you could embed tracking into the pack itself. "
SIM card isn’t GPS
I can shoot people in my state who attempt to take my vehicle by force. That's dangerous too (for them).
">Passive entry means that if the key is in range, the car will be unlocked without you having to do anything.

Keyless entry is possibly my favorite feature :/"

"Haha ZING!


I did realize since that is US numbers and they just passed 200k vehicles in the US, that is something like 1 per 1500 vehicles - and many/most of those would've been in the more recent years with less time to be stolen.

No idea how it compares with theft rates for other cars.. "
"Probably due to the fact you need engineers to steal a Tesla, and us engineers like to overthink and miss the obvious. /s"
I mean. it is private if you leave your smartphone at home. Bring a prepaid flip phone if you’re doing some shit where it’s important that nobody can track you.
"The act of leaving your house is exposing your movements in a public space. Anyone can follow anyone around if they want, but once they become a nuisance (even an emotional one), it’s harassment and illegal. 

Your phone and your car aren’t harassing you."
....so?
You can always turn off GPS / location services on your phone.  No tracking.
"""Never, ever"" is laying it on a little thick."
Hopefully it makes sure it’s not in your garage first?
"> Solution: All Tesla models will be outfitted with anti theft flare guns that fire when main power is cut

*Now* we know what the *real* purpose of Elon's not-a-flamethrower project was!!!"
The problem is the cut off for first responders.  Cut one of those and the power is disabled to the car.
"But without a sim the Tesla can't connect and report it's location, so the fact that the GPS still works is irrelevant."
"Super. So the car knows where the car is, but has no way of telling Tesla where the car is. 

Unless the car connects to any open wifi, and happens to be in proximity of one that isn't locked down, it has no way to contact Tesla."
I hear it's a hit in Lithuania too...
And 100% reason to remember the name. 
"I don't feel attacked...I just called bullshit on an argument and you clearly agree that were wrong since you ninja edited your post (but not big enough to admit it I guess).  

I'm sure that people could use a cell jammer to prevent you from tracking it, but that isn't hacking the car or suggesting it's insecure.  I did google it and I have found nothing to suggest that the car is ""wildly insecure"" as you put it.  "
"Wow that's crazy, living in the Bay area you'd think it's more like 1 per 50"
"Not even that- depending on your threat model, they could conceivably track you via cell towers."
">Bring a prepaid flip phone if you’re doing some shit where it’s important that nobody can track you.

If you turn your burner on at home, you’ve been got. Cell towers locaton data even wo GPS. The more overlap of your clean and dirty phones, the more they’ll be able to correlate the two. Leave your burner at the trap house."
"Except that there are security cameras everywhere in an urban environment. There are cameras at traffic lights, there's satellite images with high enough resolution to recognize your car. It's hard to accept, but it's extremely difficult to stay completely hidden these days in any first world country."
That’s what the cameras are for. Smile!

"Well, he is from South Africa... where cars with flamethrowers as anti-theft devices is actually a real thing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaster_(flamethrower)"
"I’m sure this is something they’ll address with removing the 12V. Somewhere, they’ll have to step down for low-voltage devices and that output won’t pose a significant risk. It could be independent of the wires first responders need to cut."
I was not aware a SIM was required for GPS functionality 
"Do we know if they look for open WiFi? I’ve never seen mine try to connect. Too many open WiFis don’t have Internet access without filling out an interstitial page. 

Now, it might be possible for other large WiFi networks (think AT&T or broadband providers) to look for pings from the Tesla WiFi and map a rough route. If you had enough large networks cooperating, it could be pretty accurate. "
That's how my old Nokia had the maps on it
That's how they found the person who went on a murder spree in my hometown back in like 01-02. They triangulated the signal of his cell and tracked him down way before smartphones or Google location services were ever a thing. Remember hearing them talking about it on the radio and being amazed that we had that kind of tech. 
"If this were true, no criminal could ever escape capture for more than a few days. We’d have the evidence to put every criminal in prison already if we’re living in a society you’ve described. Traffic cameras are few and far between, and none of them have the resolution or capability to identify faces more than a few feet away.

Facial recognition technology is fooled by sunglasses, a fake stache, or a hat, even when it’s working well, which it doesn’t on random red light cameras.

Y’all watch too many spy movies."
"Another thing people fearing car GPS misses - one day, self-driving cars WILL be a thing. You might not be in your car while it's driving - it might be going in for routine maintenance, picking up the kids or spouse, picking you up. Driving empty, or maybe performing Uber-like service in the ""off hours."" Your car being tracked isn't nearly as much ""you"" as your phone is."
"With some exceptions (like Britain), security cameras are mostly privately owned and getting footage from them is often difficult or impossible. Yes, it's getting easier and easier to be tracked but the real world doesn't work like CSI or 24, not quite yet anyway."
The movie Eagle Eye shows that pretty well
"This might be true in ~50 years, but not now."
Yes
"No, you want that pack disabled if cut, period. No energy coming out anywhere.

You could have a small battery for the tracker, but at that point, get an aftermarket solution.  Tesla doesn't need to worry about some ancillary battery pack that is needed in a few hundred car thefts."
"GPS is a passive system, meaning the car can determine its location without an active internet connection. However; for Tesla to track the location, the car has to be able to report back to home the location based on GPS data.


Remove the SIM, GPS still works, but the car can’t tell anyone."
"The problem is not a lack of information; it is a lack of manpower to process the information.  This holds true for most law enforcement or intelligence activities.

As a former intelligence analyst the difficulty was in finding the information within the noise - it was almost always available if you looked hard enough/long enough for it."
"Nice try, FBI. "
"The reason no one gets caught is that cops don't givr a crap about solving crimes. At any given time they have a hundred robberies, a couple of homicides, a thousand petty thefts, etc. They don't have resources to solve the crime nor do they want to. It's easier to prevent it by telling people they are omnipresent and always watching. Most people will abide by the rules. See TSA that's just security theater and yet most people obligingly put their scary toothpaste into small containers. Same for street cops. They will write you a speeding ticket, a jaywalking ticket, haul your ass if they catch you sverwing and driving drunk in the process because that makes money. But go Rob some grandma's house and run off before cops get there and you're lucky if anyone comes to even take a statement. They will just tell you to file insurance. 

Source: had my business broken into a couple of times. Had people steal tens of thousands of dollars worth of stuff all over the country and cops barely could be bothered to pick up a phone. "
"Hmm this interesting. I don't think it will be every car and it will still be option. I definitely don't want my car to do Uber like service. But I also don't want my car to be electric, I'd like to have an electric car but just one the rest I'd like to be petrol"
[deleted]
Ah this is the explanation I needed 
"Many phones allow you to make emergency calls without a SIM, the SIM is only an identification module that holds a private key and some other metadata, it's not really integral to actual connectivity. I wonder if it's possible to report other emergency information without one such as emergency commands and location data?

Come to think of it, is that what Google and others do when your phone is stolen and they give you the option to send a wipe command as soon as the phone is spotted on the network again?"
Another way to put it is that the GPS is only a *receiver*. Pull the SIM and the car can no longer *transmit*...
What if an open hotspot is nearby? Couldn't the car not use that?
"Haha yeah FBI, those guys are always tracking ppl through their phones."
"I'm just painting a picture of options, not mandates. Some people will use their cars as a business.

Every car likely will be automated in the longer run, or human driver insurance will be prohibitively expensive. "
"Once self-driving cars become the majority thing, cars that aren't self driving will be tracked by the streets they drive on, because they will be perceived as a potential accident threat and/or traffic nuisance that the system needs to stay aware of."
"Great I'm waiting to hear it.
Cell tower data doesn't bother me, if that's what you're going to point out. It's not accurate enough to show exactly where the phone is.
"
"One extra clarification; colloquially we refer to map-based navigation as “GPS”, whereas GPS is just the system used to determine current Latitude/Longitude based on GPS satellite radio signals. All the other features of a vehicle’s navigation system may or may not work without an internet connection."
You cannot pass data when the SIM is missing. Only emergency voice calls will work. 
"I always assumed the wipe command was sent only if the sim was present or the phone connected to google's servers via wifi. I doubt that Google is able to use the emergency services portion of the system, IIRC, that goes straight to the local tower and from there, to the nearest emergency services center. "
"If it has wifi, it’s turned on, and if you’ve authenticated with the hotspot before, then yes. But I doubt it’ll randomly connect to unsecured hotspots, that’s a privacy / security risk."
"Yeah I mean I'll probably be dead by then but I actually changed my opinion on it I was a huge Tesla fan boy in 2012, was in the military and spent most of my salary buying Tesla stock. I drove a old beater it actually just died on my after 420k miles. Now that I am an engineer I realized Tesla really isn't that great I still have stock just because idk I'm a idiot. I loved the thought of having a self driving car and it being ""eco friendly"". I do think at some point I'll be a minority and insurance will be expensive but who knows "
[deleted]
"I agree that it is a security risk, but a VPN connection directly to Tesla would mitigate at least a lot of security issues. Furthermore, when logged into a unsecured hot spot the software could simply drop all incomming connections.  "
What about becoming an engineer changed your mind?
I own a Tesla. It's way better than my ICE cars to the point that all others stopped being driven at all. Come buy my 3yo 335xi. 
"I'm guessing you think Oswald was a pawn in a massive government conspiracy too?

This is probably futile if you truly believe your conspiracy theory, but I'll give it a shot:
If you turn off the GPS function of you phone, it can't know it's location precisely enough for Google to collect MEANINGFUL data about your location. 

Try it. Leave location services off for a few days. You will stop getting requests to rate every store or park you visit.

You can also view your location history in your account settings. During periods of time when GPS is off, that history is blank.

EDIT I'm well aware of Google data collection practices. Not denying that."
"Oh man this is tough, but it boils down to working harder not smarter, Tesla is doing great things for EV , but engineering wise mistakes are being made because of bad engineering. And it seems like the community as a whole is okay with the mistakes because they're a new company. Ethically I don't agree with this, I design jets and when you get into a car airplane you don't think about it but you're putting your life into the hand of the engineers that designed it. Tesla has a really good CG  and this helps alot but I've looked into some crashes and pictures of them just to see impact forces and how they are distributed. I really enjoy this and trying to see how the structures held, I am not by any means saying that my opinion is right but to me it looks like there were failed due to manufacturing errors that weren't caught or ignored and laughed at later. 
I also went to school with and engineer that works for space x, and he just kinda ecohoed thoughts about the environment their that seem to be the same for Tesla at least from what I can gather. None of this is fact and I wouldn't try to convince you that it is just my sense. 
There are some engineering this but they aren't big and I think Tesla is advancing so you could argue that they are doing it to ""advance"" society"
"That's good, it's okay I actually don't like BMW I own one and they are just crappy for maintenance wise.  I also have a f250 it's amazing. "
[deleted]
"Interesting. Thanks for the thoughts. I wonder if you could talk yourself into a job and fix those issues ;) 

It's fascinating in particular because it seems like safety is thing to be the number one public concern with regards to self driving vehicles. So if they are ignoring safety designs, is it because they are so confident there won't be accidents caused by them? Maybe I took away the wrong point from your insight. 

Let me try to clarify: is it the manufacturing process that is flawed, or the engineering design of the vehicle? Or both?"
Have you actually driven a Tesla at all?
"Why'd you delete your other comment?  There was nothing inflammatory in it...

Anyway, I've been waiting for you to post one of the hundreds of articles on that topic that popped up since our conversation.  If you read the details, Google doesn't track your location, it's 3rd party apps that do.  Again, what I'm suggesting is turning off GPS, not just ""location services"".  In some phones there isn't a clear way to turn off the GPS radio.  You can sometimes do this by going into airplane mode, then selectively turning on only the radios you want."
"I'm on mobiles so it's hard to bring my thought and trying edit the post. In the small window plus spell check, So bare with me.  Reading articles about their manufacturing process and the mistakes done during it and also the design. I don't design cars. I design aircraft airframes.  In my opinion they either don't know or aren't accounting for it because of some other reason. Could be a total change in design and that's a big process change. 

I'm not sure if they are ignoring it . They might not have enough data to warrant a design change. Maybe they know and are holding off for the next gen Tesla. Who knows. 

"
I have driven a Tesla and I actually adore them.i drove one in 2013 it's been a while though. Why do you ask? 
"Cool. Thanks for your time and perspective :) it'll give me something to look into, though I'm no engineer."
"It's interesting, failures are pretty cool to me. Usually they are always caused by engineers cutting cost or making a wrong decisions. There is a podcast called causality it talks about engineering mishaps. I'm trying not end up on it! Lol "
Hah. I'm gonna add this to my podcast listing :)

"I'm investing the little I can afford in Tesla because I genuinely believe that the company is doing good things for the electric car market. This is awesome news.

"Yeah, but the world won a clean car, and shareable technology. 

As Al Gore has tried to remind people, what are you going to do with all your big piles of money when the world burns up?

Elon plans to fly to Mars. OK, fine. But when half of Manhattan is submerged, where do the rich plan to relocate? Is that what all their big piles of money are for? Relocation? "
My long position and calls thank you
"The price has actually been amazingly stable after markets opened despite a lot of volume being traded.  Is this the new normal for Tesla?  Did the earnings call take most of the volatility out of the stock?  

If so, it's only a matter of time until the shorts lose their nerve.  The big swings up and down probably kept them in the game.  If they hover around 330 for a few days with no signs of dipping, big players may start to head for the exits.

"My copypasta which was removed because I'm new here:

People’s views on Tesla are a symptom of a massive shift in the way the world works. There are so many obvious concepts that are not understood by the majority of people on the planet. For example, consensus has no relation to accuracy. But most model their views based on the concensus of those they identify with. This is why people were so wrong on Trump ( I am not discussing him, just highlighting an example of how the world is changing). With more information freely available and distributable than ever before in history, how do people have such opposite views on right and wrong, good news and bad news, etc?

Musk has highlighted some of these obvious concepts that everyone could easily understand, but they do not (eg - he talks about reasoning from first principles). But people do not do this. They think they understand what he means by this and they think they reason by first principles but they do not. The world does not care how you view it, or what you think at all, whether you burn witches at the stake, cure migraines by drilling holes in peoples heads (perfectly acceptable modern medical practices a few hundred years ago), or eat three meals of carbohydrates spiking your blood sugar daily, shortening your telomeres and reducing telomerase production by several thousand percent).

People do not know how the world works, they do not know that they have been building a model of the world from the day they were born, and that their model of the world is not the world. They do not interact with their model, they interact with the world. Therefore, the most accurate information information will not be very useful to them, as they would not even know that it is useful information.

They do not know how to make decisions.

On the other hand, many people do appreciate all of the above, and it is built into their daily thought processing. They keep modifying their model of the world with every mistake they make, and new thing that they learn. They are becoming more and more advanced, at an accelerated rate, while the others are stagnant. An indicator of this is the wealth gap. Oxfam can do its annual wealth gap reports, and first world idiots can dance around (protest) about inequality more and more, louder and louder. But the wealth gap grows. It is an indication of the broadening gap in potential of different human beings based on their level of awareness and therefore, their ability to be effective in this rapidly changing information age. In nyc, johannesburg, rio, mumbai, etc, there are, on the same city block, i.) humans that have no awareness, bully, get bullied, steal, rape, party all night with drugs, alcohol and then beg/ sleep all day and ii.) 14 yr old kids that are running their machine learning algorithms built in TF or Keras, running on AWS, that are simulating the epigenetic process that build proteins to accelerate neural plasticity, or allow new stem cell development traversing Waddington’s landscape, changing the lifespan of humans by several centuries. In essence, the gap is too wide, and those in the laggard group (who don’t even know what personal awareness is) have been left behind. The gap is a chasm that will never be bridged again, in essence, there has been a divergence of species, that has nothing to do with wealth, health, geography or ethnicity.

The view of Tesla’s stock price is an indication of it. They own the battery factories, the raw material mining contracts from small graphite extraction operations in Botswana, to the elimination of 3rd party dealerships (parasites) that ford, bmw, vw, etc have to include in their value chain costs. They are on the bleeding edge of automation for autonomous driving to body shop, welding, ndt, etc. Their engineers are 7-30 times more effective than ‘engineers’ at other car companies. They own the best solar panels, the best smart grid design models, the biggest solar factory on the planet, the fastest accelerating, safest cars on the planet. I could go on, but the information is… freely available. No fanboy. Just logical. There is no argument. Missing deadlines, ‘safety concerns’, model x doors, model s crashes, executives leaving etc. These are all concerns, and well considered, and placed in context.

This company will be worth more than $5 trillion within 5 years. Musk will be many times wealthier that Bezos ($500bn) by 2020. This is not about Tesla or Musk, or Twitter or Fake News or Trump. It is about the divergence of the logical capitalizing on the real information age, and the laggards, who do not even know what is going on."

"I own tesla stock but I would be very skeptical at this point. This is a cult stock and the way things are going, I wont be surprised if a big correction comes soon. 

The catalyst will be the no of canceled orders for model 3. 
There are reports of mass cancellations and I don't blame people. They promised a 35000 car not a 65000 car. Fuel savings and rebates are not price (which they include when trying to convince you that the actual price is low). "
"Granted, in the grand scheme of things a fund manager of _only_ 25 million isn't all that much as I understand it.

"$25M is a small fund.  Einhorn was working with $5 Billion, now only worth $4 Billion.  I don't know how much he shorted in Tesla, but he sure spends a lot of time releasing PR against Tesla."

Who would invest in a firm that has their biggest position as a short? That investing philosophy is out of whack. 
Someone took a lot of angry phone calls this week.  Probably hiding out somewhere
"“We believe that due to the fact that Tesla has not made money on its high end, highly optioned and highly priced cars, the odds of them making money on the Model 3 are slim. The profit margins on high end cars are far higher than mass market cars. This is an indisputable fact.”

The entire report is quite entertaining to skim if you have the time.  It’s filled with endless confident pessimism on Tesla. "
Womp Womp has made it to this sub... Great times... 
Guess we need to know about Elon and his secret lust for magic and top hats?
Holy fuck I didn’t read the date at the top and got scared. That’s why you take reddit with a grain of salt.
Hope he bought calls lol
"What did Elon do with the rabbit? ...

***ELON REVEE MUSK***, *what did you do with the rabbit‽*"
"Do we know who has short positions, how much, and when due?"
"When will these fools learn...  Elon is the master of bet-the-company situations, he’s done quite a few.   Maybe this guy was right based on the numbers, but they hit 5k/wk so they’re in the clear!"
"I mean how many doomsdayers actually fess up now? It's glorious!

"
"Well... technically Tesla is insolvent if you add up all liabilities vs. assets.  So yes, he's right - it just hasn't been declared yet.  "
"To be fair to John, Musk and Tesla DID pull a rabbit out of their hat. The way they put together GA3 in such a short time was nothing short of miraculous."
And a Russian farce still perturbed the great American nation. We got another Big Short on going.
"I'm not a fan of Musk, but there is really no group stupider than fund managers."
"From 2016:

>Tesla Motors Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk on Wednesday promised investors that the electric luxury car maker will start making money this year, sending the company’s shares up sharply despite a wider fourth-quarter loss.

[Tesla expects to become profitable in 2016, shares surge](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-results-idUSKCN0VJ2J6)

"I think GS should really fire that guy.

He is so clueless and so wrong.

Him staying longer at his current position has to hurt the company’s reputation. 

Yes, he might be a FUD mouthpiece, but even a good FUD mouthpiece needs a better credibility."
"Errr.. Tesla produced 18,000 or so model 3's in the quarter, so... What? That prediction was completely accurate. "
"That's still not all that far off. 

>""We produced 53,330 vehicles in Q2 and delivered 22,319 Model S and Model X vehicles and 18,449 Model 3 vehicles.""

If I assume that they produce as many S & X as they delivered, which is not an unfair assumption since they were stashing mostly Model 3's, they produced only 31020 Model 3 in Q2, an average of 2386/week. Sure it's not 1400, but its closer to 1400 than it is to 5000...

Edit: actually, Tesla reported producing 28578 Model 3s in Q2 so that's an average of 2198/wk."
"What do you mean? That's almost spot on. Tesla delivered 18,000 model 3 in Q2. That's under 2,000 a week and a bit above 1,400 a week."
"Oh, they see it.  They're not stupid.  Their goal is to make money in the short term.  
  
They could care less about the share price a year from now, they want to make it drop next week so they can turn a profit.  Doesn't matter if it bounces back. "
Tesla doesn’t follow the same rules as others though.  It literally surged moments after Elon apologized for acting up on the last call.  Wut? The price is dependent on his behavior in a very unorthodox way.
"> who knew an investment in infrastructure nobody else has would actually pay off!?!

As an accountant the post about them spending a lot of cash had my eyes rolling through the depths of my skull. "
"I never understand how there can be fund administrators that can'don't understand that you can't count reinvestments as losses. I argued about this for five years with a guy that was betting against Amazon because it never turned a profit. I told him ""if Amazon dropped all their investment expenditure, how would their P&L look like?"". And they could not understand that if that looked positive, the same company that is reinvesting all their profits in a wise way has an even more positive outlook!
And these people GET PAID!"
"The issue is they have models, that generally work, and they require numbers.

Visions are lost in these entirely in these models, but the numbers are what they trust, so that's what they use.

It's not their fault, the public funding system just looks at numbers over vision. If you want vision, stay private and look for VCs.

Hell, watch Shark Tank, and they only look for numbers. Only occasionally does someone buy in to a vision.

Vision is hard, and risky. Numbers are solid, and when they don't work you can say ""we're a smart company reliant on numbers, I can't be blamed for getting this wrong. 

People don't get fired for using numbers. They get fired for not using numbers.

Shorting at this point feels irresponsible so I'm not backing that up, but the system is a bunch of individuals incentivized improperly towards numbers at the expense of vision."
"I think that what the shorters are gambling on is the fact that literally the only thing that is keeping Tesla from exploding into a fiery wreckage due to the type of debt Tesla has on the books is:

1) Production targets.  If Tesla misses even once in the next several years, Elon is going to have to sell his shares in the company or sell the company, which he said he would never do

2) Investors that are evangelists that buy and hold despite the tremendous amount of external downward pressure on the stock price 

These two things are why we see stuff like the very obvious brigading and anti Tesla FUD you see getting published everywhere and why we see Elon counter attacking by becoming a Steve Jobs level master hype person and simultaneously sleeping on the factory floor and pushing everyone to the brink of mental breakdowns to hit their production targets 

The biggest gamble the short sellers are making which I think is a mistake is that Musk is not capable of hitting the production targets because in their experience no one has been able to catch lightning in the bottle every single quarter for years straight except for Bezos and Jobs 

Elon is definitely at their level though and I think he will be able to pull magic out of his hat.

I do think the Solar City acquistion was a mistake though that may have put the company in a more precarious position debt wise than they needed to be "
"Reminders:

* Tesla stock is trailing the market by over 12% year over year. 

* No one ""loses"" money on an investment until they close their position in it.

* Amazon is a real company.  So far this year its stock is outperforming Tesla's by about 50%.  Over the past year it is ahead by ~80%.  Over the past two years it is beating Tesla by 88%.  Over the past 5 years it is beating Tesla by nearly 400%. "
"Not necessarily, shorters need a quick drop in price. The price being stable over time means they are losing money in interest paid to the original holders"
This must be highly upvoted. Real squeeze doesnt begin until it reaches 450 
Watch what happens tomorrow.
A $50 bump in one day is significant and probably signals a new floor in the $335-$370 range rather than the old $275-$325 range.

"just FYI, investing in the stock won't help Tesla, they don't get any money from you buying a share. Best way to support them is to buy products from them, and if you can't afford a car then buy other merchandise like shirts, hats, and whatever else they sell."

"I did at $35, and as you can imagine, it paid handsomely (hey, I was able to afford a Model X! :-)). Best luck to you!"
"Covered Short (as opposed to a naked short) works like this.

In oversimplified terms:

1. Lets say you have 1 Tesla stock, currently priced at 300 dollars.
2. I come and say, hey, i'll pay you 10 bucks to ""borrow"" that stock for 3 months, and you agree to it (that price is based on current market sentiment on where Tesla should be in 3 months).
3. I now sell the stock for 300 dollars.
4. Scenario 1: 3 months later, stock is now at 250. I go buy a Tesla stock at 250 and ""return"" it to you (covering my position). I made 40 bucks.
5. Scenario 2: 3 months later, stock is now at 330. I have to go buy a Tesla stock at 330 and return it to you. I lost 40 bucks.

In reality, those contracts themselves are traded as options on the futures market, and it's a bit more complicated than that."
"They are betting against the company. When Tesla's stock goes down, they make cash, when it goes up, they lose (a billion) dollars (in a day)."
"Most people bet on stocks rising in price. A ""short"" is someone who is betting on a stock dropping in price."
"Something I don't think anybody mentioned--when you buy a stock you're only risking as much money as you put in.  Buy $1,000 worth of Tesla, and the absolute worst that could happen is they go bankrupt and you lost that $1,000.  But there's no limit to how high it could go, so if they do well, you could earn a lot.

Short selling $1,000 worth of Tesla stock can never earn you more than $1,000.  But if the stock goes up, you have to pay more money in.  And every day you're waiting, hoping for the stock to drop, you're paying interest and fees.  There is no limit to how much you could wind up owing.  This is why short selling is so dangerous.

 "
"simply put, its a bet that the stock of a company will fall. So if you ""short"" a stock, and the price goes down, you make money.
But its risky, because if the price instead goes up, there is unlimited loss potential on your ""bet"""
"Essentially someone who is betting against a stock and thinking the price will go down. 
A short is someone who “borrows” a stock at market price from someone in the hope they can give it back to them at a lower market price after the stock falls and profiting from the difference. 
"
"Easiest explanation:

Shorting consists of 4 steps:

1. Borrow a stock from person

2. Sell the stock on the market

3. Buy the stock again on the market

4. Give back the stock to the person.

If you sell it for higher in step 2 than you later buy it in step 3, you turn a profit.

Key fact is that you borrow x number of stock from a person and have to give the same amount of stock back eventually. So you can sell the borrowed stock right now, with the hopes that you can buy it later for cheaper."

"> Shares available to short are only 144,337 Shares according to fidelity. 

I'm really hoping to see these guys burn.  I get that some short term day traders might legitimately want to short Tesla from time to time, but those kind of shorting numbers are to me pretty stupid.  I just don't see the fundamentals being a big deal with regards to Tesla and predictions of the company's imminent bankruptcy are greatly exaggerated.

Elon Musk and the Tesla engineers are learning some painful lessons about production lines running at the roughly 10k/week level... something they haven't really needed to deal with before to this point.  Still, the market is strong and Tesla makes an outstanding product with strong consumer demand.

To me, Tesla is the strongest automotive company I've seen since the era of the Dodge brothers and Henry Ford.  They've been able to get well past the problems faced by John DeLorean and Preston Tucker, and if you need reminding that it is inevitable that an electric car would do well.... just look as Fisker as an example.  It is a brutal business, but I think Tesla is doing very well and has mostly done the right moves needed to stay in business."

The puts I sold thanks you too.
"> it's only a matter of time until the shorts lose their nerve

It's not nerve, the shorts are forced to cover eventually, depending on term.  Most are probably a week or 2, some go as long as a year.  As their terms come up and they're forced to cover, they lose money but their buys push the price higher... it's a slow motion climb fueled by shorts forced to keep buying.  And with so many shorts, that could go on for months.  Earnings reports do this most effectively, so actual profit in Q3 is what you should be looking at, today is an appetiser and the next quarter is snacks."

They owe money to their broker.  May get friendly visit from guy wielding bat.
"The end of Trading Places.  

Margin call gentlemen.

You can't expect us to...

You know perfectly well we don't have 394mil in cash!

Put the Duke brother's seats on exchange up for auction, seize all assets of Duke & Duke Commodities Brokers, as well as all personal belongings of Randolph and Mortimer Duke.


Well...in real world if you can't pay, you better declare bankruptcy and sell all your belongings to settle in court.    "
"It usually wouldn't get to that point.  Once the loss gets high enough that margin account looks undercaptialized, their broker will liquidate their holdings to buy back the stock and prevent further losses.  If it shoots up fast enough that the loss outweighs their entire account, then their broker would demand that they provide the funds from elsewhere, and could potentially sue them and force a bankruptcy."
"As an example this is the [Edward Jones Margin Disclosure Statement](https://www.edwardjones.com/images/margin-disclosure-statement.pdf). Page 2 has the description of what happens when shorted stock prices go up.  

So, let's pretend that I shorted 1,000 shares of stock at $10/share using Ed Jones. I get $10,000 from the sale and at some point I'm expected to give 1,000 shares back. My plan is to buy the shares back when the price hits $6/share. I'd buy them back for $6,000, return the 1,000 shares, and still have $4,000 left over in profit. Awesome!  

However, the stock moves the other way... at $20/share Ed Jones tells me ""Hey, buddy you're really taking a bath on that stock you shorted. You going to be able to buy back those 1,000 shares?"" To which I reply ""Sure, I've got $20,000 in cash in my account. I'm sure that's going back down soon. I can cover my losses.""  

But it gets worse... at $50/share Ed tells me ""Uhhh.... Sport, don't have enough cash to cover those 1,000 shares that are now going to cost you $50,000."" I confidently reply again ""Well, I still have that $20,000 in cash plus $30,000 of Cheesecake Factory stock which I could sell to cover my losses.""  

Finally, long before the stock gets to $1,000/share valued at $1,000,000 Ed calls me up. ""Yeah, the stock you shorted hit $200/share today. You were on the hook for $200,000 which is what your total account was worth. The $20K of cash, the $30K of Cheesecake Factory and $150K of other assets are all gone to buy and return the 1,000 shares that you borrowed.""  

If I somehow had millions and millions of dollars in my account to backstop my short position the broker would let me get as upside down as I wanted to be (and charge me interest on the borrowed value) but would never get into a place where the broker might be on the hook for the borrowed shares. The instant my total account value went to $-0.01 it all goes poof."
"Not even close.  Not yet.  A real short squeeze would send the stock shooting well over 400 before pulling back.  
"
"Almost there, not until the losses are realized. They may try and sabotage Tesla somehow, hopefully they can't weasel out of this but never celebrate before the dust settles. Who knows how big their margins are and what else they are willing to do to manipulate markets."

"Quite true.

I prefer to point people toward trends.  Those open to a new worldview can learn a lot from trends.  

Very easy example.  No significant new nuclear energy generation will ever be built in the US.  The cost of building a new nuclear plant goes up every year, the cost of running one goes up every year.  The cost of solar/wind/storage goes down every year. Every year. And we've already reached the inflection point where renewable is cheaper than nuclear.  Extrapolating that out 5-10 years just makes the situation much worse for nuclear, it won't compete at all.  In 10 years, all of the US nuclear plants will be closing because it will be cheaper to build a new renewable+storage than it will be to maintain an existing nuker.  There is no opinion here, it's just looking at the facts and industry reports and trends over time.

Guess who sells PV and storage, btw?  Tesla."

">But the wealth gap grows. It is an indication of the braodening gap in potential of different human beings based on their level of awareness and therefore

"A little bit wordy, but yes."
You can't wait indefinitely because you pay interest and that has become too costly lately.
"Many possible reasons.  

For one, many bigger funds that had adopted a ""lets wait and see the financials"" approach after the big 5K push because they need to be able to explain their actions to their clients probably felt they now had enough solid info to jump in.  Smaller investors follow suit, and there isn't enough negative sentiment to counterbalance it.  Eventually the number of people willing to sell at 330 dried up and the price started rising.  

What we didn't see was some kind of profit-taking close to the end of the day, leading to a decline.  I am by NO MEANS an expert, but I interpret that that the prevailing sentiment is that the stock is going to keep rising tomorrow as shorts start to get margin calls, meaning they *HAVE* to buy stock to cover their positions.

"Elon didn’t go off the rails in the conference call. Thats it.

Q1 call rage and twitter was pretty much the only “thesis” that pushed the stock so low recently.

">What information do we have that says once we hit an ATH, shorts will cover? What makes ~$383 so important, instead of say... $400... $500?

Nothing. As long as they can fund their margins (if they short thru brokerage accounts) or if they are big whales who short with their own money, they can hold as long as they feel holding it.

"I really \*really\* don't see why. 

1) ""reports of mass cancellations"" is not a confirmation, so you're making investing decisions on hearsay 

2) If demand for the $65k price point is strong, it makes perfect business sense to prioritize that configuration, if you owned Tesla, why would you introduce a configuration that presents negative margins, until your production capacity was ready?  You wouldn't.  You'd wait until your 30% margin was stable, and then bring it out.  Just because it's late doesn't mean it isn't going to happen.  :eyeroll:

Sounds like just more shoddy short logic."
"I got a $48K (after tax incentive). More than I expected, but it likely is worth at least that if not more and I've never bought a car that was worth more than when I bought it..."

1. How many of those ""cancellations"" were converted to Model S and Model X orders when it became obvious the tax credit was going away.
2. How many were cancelled when the floodgates opened and it became obvious a reservation was no longer necessary (can still be useful, but you don't need one to place an order).

Of course many reservations were canceled, doesn't mean people are no longer buying a Tesla..."

"Production != Delivery

18000 Delivered + 11000 in Transit = 29000 for Q2"
"""Sustaining"" is not the same as ""averaging"". ""Sustaining"" implies a relatively stable rate over a long period of time. Obviously the analysts are aware that the production rate grew to get to that point, so they're saying production won't just average 1400/week, but it will level out there in Q2. Which it didn't.

The quote was about **production**, not deliveries. Tesla delivered 18,449 Model 3s but **produced** 28,578. That's 2198 a week on average, which is >50% higher than estimated, and higher than the peak at the end of Q1. So that's just not a good guess."
Lol this guy
They’ve been heavily ramping up... look at July numbers vs June. 
"To get that figure you are taking an average, whereas it's obvious Tesla has been increasing all quarter. They are now somewhere close to 5,000/week, and carefully working towards 6,000/week, and onwards from there. Every time Bloomberg's tracker indicates another1,000/week, the share price will climb again, probably about 10% gain per 1,000."
"They could not care less* 

Right now they care very little, that’s why they could not care less"
"I’m no expert but the way I see it is this:

Analysts are judging Tesla as if it is any normal company where investors only want profits. I think Tesla has a much higher percentage of investors that really really want the company to succeed and a higher percentage of boom or bust investors. I think that makes the stock way more resilient to both short term performance hits and to additional capital raises should that need to happen. "
So why maintain a short position for years?
Do you think they will be able to make it drop next week or is this rush the short squeeze?
It’s not just short term investors the same long term value guys dumped on amazon for years.

"This is a trait the short storytellers use to very powerful effect, they tend to spread stories about gossip and intrigue surrounding tesla personnel as often than they do  financially rooted stories  and that kind of pointless emotional tactic can cut both ways, especially when it's backed by financially sound good news  at the same time"
I also did not understand this. Now that you put it this way I don't understand it even more.
"When the first item in your list is so blatantly wrong, it’s really hard to find any motivation to continue reading. "
"This is completely wrong.  Tesla has significantly missed production targets in the past and has been completely fine.  There is no debt on Tesla's books that are spelling impending doom.  Tesla's boutique investors have insanely weak hands and run away at any sign of FUD, which is why shorts are spreading FUD in the first place.


The reason you have been seeing ""anti-FUD"" from people (like me) is because the FUD/short thesis is straight up retarded.  Tesla will not go BK because that's not how capital markets work.  


The only thing I even somewhat agree with you on is that the timing of the Solar City acquisition was not ideal for Tesla, however seeing Tesla's love for vertical integration, Tesla would probably have acquired a solar company eventually--just probably after Model 3 ramp was stabilized and they have access to cheaper funds."
"This is... completely wrong.  Like, 100% incorrect."
Amazon started with their investments way earlier than Tesla...
"> Amazon is a real company. So far this year its stock is outperforming Tesla's by about 50%. Over the past year it is ahead by ~80%. Over the past two years it is beating Tesla by 88%. Over the past 5 years it is beating Tesla by nearly 400%.

So Tesla's trailing behind a company with a decade-long head start after about a year of their first mass-market vehicle being in production? I guess we'll see how rough things look for Tesla in another decade."
"The appropriate comparison to Amazon would be when Amazon was at a similar point in its life-cycle as Tesla is now.  For many many years analysts beat up on Amazon, claiming that it would never make money.  Now it's taking over the world.

As for you quip that ""Amazon is a real company,"" suggesting that Tesla is not, is about as sad and desperate a thing as I've read on this board.  Tesla is not some esoteric financial holding company with intangible products, it's a manufacturing company.  They actually make shit.  It doesn't get any more real than that.

As for the shorts not losing money, there's this thing called a margin call..."
"Reminder: they also have a 9 year head start, and you're comparing apples and oranges.

Otherwise valid points"
"I am on mobile. But you can probably check these facts online.

AMZN went public at the ~$2 mark in 1997. 9 years into the game they were at ~$40 mark (20X return) in Nov 2006 before Wall St caught on to what Bezos was really up to and the stock really started rallying.

TSLA went public at the $20 mark in 2010 and is currently at $330 mark. So a 16X return in about 8 years.

I am not the conspiracy theory kind of person, however the amount of TSLA hate on WallSt is just fucking amazing and irrational and not grounded in any sort of understanding of the reality of the moat that Elon has built- product, distribution, service and refueling.

My investments in AMZN were driven by my experience as a customer, and now I am out. Similarly I  am happy with both my Model S and Model 3 and I continue to be long on my outlook for TSLA.

That said, let's wait another 10 years and let this play out. "
"Is Tesla not a ""real company"" in your opinion? "
"I’m not so sure it’s such a useful comparison tbh, totally different companies."
"*No one ""loses"" money on an investment until they close their position in it.*

But shorts commonly have to cover their position within a fixed time schedule, no?"
this is the most retarded post ever. comparing amazon and tesla lol. sounds like someone lost money.
"Remember how analysts focused on Amazon losing money? Sounds Familiar.

Also remember how an online grocer/seller selling computing over the internet is not going to go anywhere... I mean, someone like Microsoft or Google are far more qualified to do that type of service? Right. AWS is basically a license to print money. No other cloud is even close. Everyone else got there late, and Amazon enjoys a HUGE lead.  Jaguar, Porcshe, etc will eventually add competition, but also Tesla's massive lead on Software and the Supercharger network are not something to easily dismiss. Jag and Porsche getting into the game only legitimizes it. Just like when Google and Azure came to market, more and more people were willing to go cloud. "
Get out of here with your logic.  Everyone knows the best investment decision are made based off of emotion. 
"> Amazon is a real company.

Yeah, while Tesla is just a giant pyramid scheme, right? Go back to enoughmuskspam."
"Shorters pay interest to the original holders of the shares, so they actually are losing money even if the price is relatively stable "
It is also true that the biggest mistake people make is holding on to a losing position for too long.

Enough with your facts. This is a Tesla fantasy thread.
"Tesla has gone just about nowhere in the past year. The S&P 500 is up 15%. 

If you shorted Tesla and used the proceeds to go long S&P you made more money than if you were just long the S&P. The cost of borrow is trivial now, and has been. "

"Seeing the popularity of Tesla, I think companies will begin to switch.

What we really need though is a new battery technology. Li-ion is good, but not great. Once a safer, denser battery exists, cheaper battery hits the mass market, ICEs will be done for."
"That's all I ultimately care about, faster the world can transition to electric cars, the better. And Tesla will drag rest of the industry to EVs faster even if they kick and scream. If Tesla is making 120MPG car, they can't bitch and moan to european regulators how they can't possibly meet the standards.

The european heat waves are absolutely insane, I live in Prague and last time I was sweating as much was in Egypt 10 years ago. To think that this will be yearly occurrence in 20-30 years is insane. And the problem is not my sweating balls but the fucking droughts which will kill all the harvest and then you have food shortage crisis. And then we are all fucked. Bernie was right, Global Warming is the biggest problem since WW2 and everyone just sits on their ass. "
AND MY CAPEX!

"Stock values work on supply and demand. If more people invest, the price gets driven up which equals a higher market cap. It absolutely helps."
Wrong. The higher value the stock the more the can borrow and the more valuable it is to raise the amount of stock.
"It does.  The stock is how Tesla can raise cash if they need to.  High stock price means they can issue 10% more new shares and get a check from GoldmanSachs for $5B and turn that into a new Gigafactory.

Low stock price means 10% new shares only nets them $3B, so they either have to print more shares or get less capital."
"You're right in that it doesn't directly help Tesla. However, investing and holding a stock keeps the stock value up. Higher stock value = more credibility for Tesla for outside financing and loans. It helps in the sense that everyone sticking around for the long haul has effectively put their money where their beliefs are.

I know I'm not much, I barely account for anything. Just like when I vote."
"No No No.....Yes, you can do more for their bottom line in buying a car (hats, really?), but Tesla's stock going up absolutely will help. 

They need their stock to be north of $359 come March or they're going to have to come up with a shit ton of cash ($920 Million to be exact). Stock over $359 and all that debt converts to stock and everyone walks away happy.

Which is why shorts see blood in the water. Keep the stock down and Tesla has to cough up almost a billion dollars which could cause problems depending on their cash position. Stock goes up, cash problem goes away....In really general terms as I understand it.

Now will you or I make a dent in a company with a 59B market cap. Not really, but a lot of you and Is buying (sometimes blindly) has helped make Tesla damn near bullet proof at times."
"damn, this sounds total blind worshiping."
They sell flamethrowers.
"I should have.

Tho I'm pretty garbage with investments right now, I'm just starting out, so I keep my shares low :P"
"This is one of the clearer explanations so far, thank you :)"
"Thanks for the explanation, it's the best one I've read so far. Would you mind explaining naked shorts too?"
Isn't this a naked short? A covered short you would have an option to purchase a share of stock to cover what happens if the price surges.
"very nice explanation, i have a stupid question: why does this exist? is it just people coming up with ""new ways"" to make money? isn't it basically gambling? (unless you have inside information)"
"I had no idea people borrowed stocks from each other like this. Shorts make a lot more sense to me now, thanks."
Wow. Thank you. I caught the basic meaning of it from The Big Short but they didn't really explain the exact way it worked. 
"The opposite, going ""long"" on stocks, means that you are simply buying shares and holding them."
Yeah your second paragraph is very important. Selling short takes place in a margin account. So it's not exactly just the opposite of buying long. Borrowing a stock comes with it's own hefty baggage
">there is unlimited loss potential

Only if they are selling calls.  Puts have limited risk."
For the layperson they are better off with doing a put instead of a short. 
This seems insane? Why would people 'short' a company that is very clearly leading in its category?
This just seems like straight up gambling... 
"You can also be short via puts, although I am not sure if that considered a ""short"", but it is a less risky way to bet against a company."
Finkle and einhorn finkle and einhorn. Name that movie...
"And yet he keeps digging in... If his TSLA short gets worse, hell get hit with margin reqs and redemptions at the same time. Greenlight capital's run is over. "
"Wow, haven't heard from him today"
The real burn will be when Tesla is profitable.  That will fuel another +100 points rally.
"I think the shorts and the pain of the Model 3 ramp will be good for Tesla in the long run.

They are now heavily focused on profitability, cutting costs and spending capital efficiently."
"I know. ""To the inland home Geeves!"""
">When half of Manhatten is submerged, the rich will relocate a few miles inland.

"Yes, that's a given. I wonder why NASA and others don't want to start with a test case, like the moon? See if atmosphere can be created around the moon first before they start to try to make Mars habitable? "
"Exactly. It's just like refusing to create Medicare for All. The wealthy somehow think they are saving money by not expanding health coverage or by making health care non-profit instead of a for-profit, but look at how the birth rates have shrunk in the most expensive states like California.

That birth rate shrank because the cost of medical care, and living in CA is so outrageous people aren't having as many kids anymore.

No kids = no new, young, vibrant customers for health care. That leaves us with nothing but old folks to care for. 

The wealthy push up the cost of living in CA because they are so very self-involved, but they can't see it's going to bite them in the rear eventually.

Same with new customers. As people around the world stop having so many babies because the cost of living rises globally, where are these companies new customers going to come from? Who will buy all their hot, new tech globally when people stop having babies either because they don't want to raise kids anymore just so those kids can see the extinction of humanity, or because they can't afford them.

I don't expect the uber capitalists to see this. They live from quarter to quarter and can't see a thing beyond that. But I do expect global policymakers to see this and make laws to reign in and regulate these nutjobs.

Instead, what's happened in the U.S., is that the uber capitalists get voted into office. Then they influence other members of Congress. The nuts overrun the squirrels. 

"
">It's not nerve, the shorts are forced to cover eventually, depending on term. Most are probably a week or 2, some go as long as a year.

Could you please explain? Seriously asking, I'm a short and have no clue what you're referring to, it's like you're describing an alien world. That's not how any of this works."
"
> Earnings reports do this most effectively, so actual profit in Q3 is what you should be looking at, today is an appetiser and the next quarter is snacks.

So long as they are sure to serve, I'll be willing to wait for the entree. I know it's a risky bet to be long on them, but the cars are so fun! They're thought to just cater to a niche market, but the potential market size is actually so much bigger, once more people see the Model 3 on the road."
"> thats why the media( the biz world) hates tesla.

Please, if Mary Barra had 1/20th the number of magazine covers that Elon has had she'd be thrilled.

The classic margin call. Broker sells it before it hits the at risk level. 
"If the price spiked and the broker couldn't buy the shares back in time before the price went well out of range, AND assuming everyone else is doing the same thing with this broker. Does the broker keep any specific amount of reserves on hand to guarantee that THEY are able to buy the shares on behalf of their shorting customers who are way over margin? If not, do the people who originally owned the stock get screwed if a broker goes under?"

"You are mistaken. The wealth that Bezos has is hundreds of times larger than that of most corrupt presidents/ officials in corrupt, 3rd world administrations. You have no appreciation for the potential of a human mind. The smart, who understand the world they live in and keep innovating are creating unfathomable wealth. Bezos is a precursor to Musk - he will be the first trillionaire, unless one of the other innovators beats him. Jobs, whose company's success is mainly attributable to the insights generated in his mind, is, although dead, responsible for what is imminently the first trillion dollar company. You can scoff, but this is not a proposal on how I would like things to be. It is an observation of how things are, and how they are unfolding. "
Sorry typing one handed and autocorrect on my phone while eating a sandwich.
"So you are telling me, when the stock goes from $330 to $285, the longs didn't lose $1billion, yet the short lose a billion when the stock goes from $285 to $330.  I sure don't know how stock market works then."
"Neither are people who are short. 

Frankly, shorts should feel pretty confident that, apparently, Tesla bulls seem to have no idea how the stock market works. "

It's a 7 year account with 900 karma. The person is concern trolling. 
"I hope you did not buy any more or took some profits from tsla. I was talking about this correction and got downvoted. As I said, its a cult stock and current valuation does not match even the future earning. I think it will stabilize around 230-240. I was just trying to help. "
"The stock value has priced in people who ordered teslas as buying them. I am not saying anything about the car quality or how amazing it is. My point is that most of the enthusiasm goes away when people realize that they have to pay almost 55 to 60 k to get a small car compared to lets say an accord hybrid which costs arnd 32k and gets you 600 miles per fill up. Plus us oil production will never let the oil price go very high so the trend of big cars is back and here to stay for a while. Tesla has to sell a lot of model 3s to justify the stock price and they cant do it at the current price point. They really need to get the cost down by either getting prod cost down or sale at less margin. Both will be net negative for the stock. The only other option is to do a big cap raise which will hurt the stock as well. So purely speaking regarding stock, it has a lot morr down potential compared to up. That said, i love the car. Just too expensive.

Edit - sorry replied to wrong person but i am leaving it here.  Also those are very optimistic assumptions.  I know what i said is an assumption as well because we dont have any cancellation numbers but we had somewhat credible leaks. "

"> For many many years analysts beat up on Amazon, claiming that it would never make money.

Those analysts were idiots.  Amazon has been making money forever.  They just reinvest everything back into new ventures.  People like to claim Tesla is doing the same thing and compare the two companies, but Tesla has never had an operating profit.  They don't reinvest profits back into new ventures, they have to tap the capital markets to fund themselves."

Yes. You pay to play. His statement is flat wrong.
I was the one pointing out that a comparison to Amazon is silly.
"One of Tesla's biggest strengths is it's willingness to vertically integrate parts of the business no other car manufacture would touch. On the earnings call we more about the custom silicon Tesla has produced to improve their autopilot performance. Not only do they get a more efficient chip, they won't need to pay a supplier (Nvidia) going forward which is more money in their pockets. They do this surprisingly often."
"No, it is just a venture that is using funding from the capital markets to produce and sell a product below cost.  That is not sustainable.  "
"Yes, going rate is something like 2%.  But on the other side of the trade, they get cash from the investor they sell the shares to up front.  They can then invest that cash in something like a US government bond fund that yields 3%. "
"Amazon has had operating profits every year for well over a decade.  Compare that to Tesla.  It is ridiculous to compare the companies.  Jeff Bezos may be a sociopath, but his company makes real profits."
If you just invested the money in the S&P you would have done better.  Shorting Tesla is not a win if it trades sideways.  You need a drop.

As a skeptical person I am very hesitant believing any conspiracies, but it was very telling when the moment TSLA hit 5k, they started circlejerking how there is no actual demand for model 3. I am not saying all media or anything, but there are certain guilty parties which are always spinning this shit no matter what. They we posting pictures of a parking lot with cars as if Tesla has some hidden conspiracy how those cars were never finished or something, this is Alex Jones level of bullshit. 

We had many posts here with people being hesitant to buy model 3 because Tesla is facing imminent bankruptcy. **These lies actively hurt the company, that's why they are doing them, not because they think stock is overvalued.** 

Tesla rightfully deserves criticism for many things they have done, but not the way they are doing. Bunch of idiots trying to get rich on bankrupting a company and 40k people losing jobs. Like with Bitcoin, when money is involved they lose any sense of decency when money is involved, to the point they attack acclaimed journalist for praising model 3.

A battery breakthrough would blow open the market.
"You forget reduced maintenance cost, increased performance, convenience(refuel @ home), OTA updates, AP(FSD soon), and much stabler and cheaper fuel price(electric v. Petrol) , which none of the ICE cars can do now.

And those are just the practical benefits. Not to mention carbon footprint and positive feedback on climate change.

IMO this is already the year ICE cars are done for. Just look at the July sales numbers. Even with conventional Li-x batteries.

"
"Li-ion battery tech is not holding back the market, only production volume of batteries and vehicles, at least from Tesla's level of tech.  All tech has safety concerns, and what evidence is there that Tesla hasn't adequately mitigated any Li-ion risks (they've set their storage products and car batteries on fire to demonstrate they don't become an uncontrollable hazard).  Once Tesla reaches the $35K price target for the Model 3, there will be little reason to go ICE; but that will be less relevant as autonomous driving will accelerate the move away from the concept of personal car ownership (and commercial fleets are more concerned with maintenance and fuel costs, so they can handle higher initial purchase prices).  That's before considering all the form factors current EVs now make possible.

The current looming issue for Automotive Li-ion is that the recycling infrastructure isn't fully built or fully cost justifiable, but some companies have sprung up to rebuild/repurpose old battery packs.  (Well that an there just aren't enough batteries being made to supply all car companies today, but considering the need to build out the charging infrastructure as well, there's probably a limit to how quickly things can change)."
They are already switching. 
some one should bring super capcitor energy density closer to Li-Ion. It will be game over. 
"What’s scary about that is that it could affect Tesla the most. Say company Y comes out with a new great battery technology and other manufacturers start using it in volumes while Tesla is stuck with its huge production lines for li-ion. If Tesla is pushing the technology on the other hand it would be great for them. Buy a Tesla or a competitor with half the range, what would you choose if the price was equal?"
"> What we really need though is a new battery technology. Li-ion is good, but not great.

No you fucking don't. Next refresh of X/S will likely offer 500mil range and next major refresh of M3LR will have the same. At 500mile range you don't have issues, almost anywhere on the planet.

Stop with the pipe dream battery. In the future carbon nanotubes will change the world more than plastic, but we can't be waiting for it. At 50$ per cell, ICE are absolutely toasted. We have the technology, we just need to build bigger factories and let economies of scale do rest of the work.

The fact that ICE cars have 100 years of economies of scale, millions of cars a year, yet small volume company like Tesla is able to compete with them tells you how fucked that industry is. When EV makers start making cars by millions, ICE cars will look like expensive piece of junk."

"> Yes, you can do more for their bottom line in buying a car (hats, really?)

I said if you can't afford the car then the next best thing is stuff like shirts and hats.

> They need their stock to be north of $359 come March or they're going to have to come up with a shit ton of cash ($920 Million to be exact). Stock over $359 and all that debt converts to stock and everyone walks away happy.

Do you think buying a few stock months ago would have any effect on the stock price at all? At least buying merch is cash in hand, which is better than the 0 effect it would have on their stock price.

> Which is why shorts see blood in the water. Keep the stock down and Tesla has to cough up almost a billion dollars which could cause problems depending on their cash position.

That's one of the issues, the other is can the company even be profitable. It's a bit of a stretch to think they can go from record loss to record profits in such a short time. 

> Now will you or I make a dent in a company with a 59B market cap. Not really, but a lot of you and Is buying (sometimes blindly) has helped make Tesla damn near bullet proof at times.

Tesla is far from bullet proof. Probably the biggest help they have right now is from reservation holders that have given up $1k up to $250k (or whatever the roadster deposit was). That makes up a large chunk of their cash on hand. Without those people giving Tesla interest free loans, Tesla wouldn't have much cash left at all."

"Sure!

In oversimplified terms:

Market price is again 300 dollars. 

1. I have no Tesla stock, and I don't go borrow one
2. I sell you a Tesla stock at 300 the current market price, and I promise to deliver it to you in 1 week
3. Depend on market price in 1 week, I will then have to go out in the market, and buy a Tesla stock at market value and deliver it to you. My profit or loss is the difference. 

You can see how you could abuse a naked short sell like this (i.e. I can go short more stocks than the trading volume since I don't have to actually own, or even have borrowed that stock). Failure to deliver on those contracts in significant numbers (when the naked short sellers fails to actually acquire the stock they promised to deliver) can have some serious market distorting effects. "
"> unless you have inside information

Or if you fabricate negative news about the company to cause other people to sell their stock so you can buy it at a lower price.

"Shorts and futures contracts exists because people want to be able to adjust their risk.

"They were talking about short selling, not options trading. "
"They're shorting the stock, not selling calls (or) buying puts."
"It's not really a commentary on the company directly, but they are betting that the current stock price is too high. This doesn't mean. The company is bad, just overvalued. They wouldn't just make money if Tesla failed, but for any drop in value. Leading their category and correctly valued are not the same..."
"Shorting stocks is totally normal. It’s a loan, basically. If I own one share currently at $10, and you say you want to borrow it, I say fine. Then I start charging you a fee to borrow it. Meanwhile, you sell the borrowed stock for $10. Later on, the stock goes to $8. Then you buy it back at $8 so you can give it back to me, the person who let you borrow it. You made $2, minus the fees I charged you.

The short thesis on Tesla was legit in the early days. Elon has made some “bet the whole company” moves during Tesla’s short history. Their ability to execute on these occasions have always been make or break. That’s something worth betting on, if you play the markets like a casino game. (Hint: they are.) 

Now that they’ve achieved an economy of scale and vertical integration, generated significant demand and manufacturing output to match, the number of legit short theses are slim to none. Therefore, misinformation and sabotage are the new short strategy. Somehow, amazingly, none of which is technically illegal. "
"You believe that the stock is overvalued - a successful company can still be overvalued, and when the market correction occurs you would be able to profit by having the short. I am not saying I think TSLA is overvalued, but a short doesn't necessarily have to be a bet on total failure."
"Shorts perform an important mechanism in the market. Rather than cheerlead like the majority usually is, which only runs up the market to a bubble if left unchecked in a fit of ""irrational exuberance,: shorts are sniffing around reading report footnotes, looking for cooked books like Enron and Tyco and a host of chinese scam companies that picked up NYSE ticker symbols (for example). Shorts can be early warning of trouble in companies and helps keep them honest. 

What people don't like is that they tend to like to promote the bad information they've found as a way of swaying the market. But it's just a counter to the companies' promoting of their own rosy pictures, so it's not exactly an imbalance. Market bubbles are bad. Someone needs to be the sober party. And any reputable analyst or investor will disclose their positions before reporting, whether long or short. So it's not like you don't know they are selling their book."
"It's gambling.  They short the stock, go on air/social media/etc to create FUD/fake news/etc/anything to make Tesla look bad hoping to drive the share price down or go bankrupt so they can cash in and score.  That's the most extreme case.  Some just believe the price is going to go down based on fundamentals (i.e. losing money every quarter so share price should go down).  But stock markets are irrational."
"Because the current stock price is absurdly high; Tesla's market cap is higher than *every* other automaker besides Volkswagen [EDIT: and Toyota] while their production is still barely significant in comparison.

It'll only be justified if they truly become one of the world's most dominant companies, which is still far from a safe bet. There's a lot of money and experience behind the competition.

In the short term: the early months of Model 3 ""production"" were hardly worthy of the word - 2600 from July to December 2017, or about a dozen per day. Tesla have been promising a real ramp-up every quarter for an entire year, and many investors were skeptical that the latest promises would be any different.

The last quarter (as with the previous few) was massively loss-making, they've not got much spare cash, and can't borrow any more than they already have at sane interest rates. A capital raise (selling more shares) would naturally dilute the value of the existing ones, so the shorts would make money. If they went bankrupt, the shorts would make a *lot* of money.

If the long-promised surge in production *hadn't* finally been achieved last quarter, they'd have little chance of turning a profit before the current funding runs out. Even now, they need to both increase production and cut costs dramatically to meet that target, and it's still not obvious why Elon sounds so confident about it."
"It is possible for Tesla to be leading and it's stock price to be too high. I don't follow the stock but it moved around alot in the past. More than other stocks. This attracts people to bet on the movement. For someone without a bet, it doesn't really matter if it trades for 250, 300, or 400 a share. People on this subreddit tend to give Short s a bad rap. People with a bet have a financial incentive to comment a certain way. So shorts can come off as negative in what would normally be a fan subreddit."
"It is very insane, even if you believe the company will do terribly. When you buy a stock, you cannot lose more money than you put in. When you short a company, there is no cap on how much money you can lose."
"I used to be a financial markets broker. Trading in generally is basically gambling, for every winner there is a loser. The whole market is 50/50 and the house still almost always wins. The house is giant financial institutions in this case instead of casinos. "

"I think Tesla would be very profitable right now if it wasn't for massive and aggressive growth and capital outlays into new products and services. Then again, that is sort of what the investors ought to be accustomed to the company doing and in the long run is going to help.

Where the company is currently suffering is in scales of operation where nobody in the company to any large degree is used to those production scales.  Sure, Telsa could in theory get some VP or engineering manager from another auto company to help out (and a few are at Tesla), but Tesla is also trying to do a few things different from other automakers to get a competitive edge."

"When you short a stock, you sell something you don't own (you borrow shares) to someone who wants to buy a share at the market price today. You're betting the price will do down in the future (whatever term) and you can buy the shares you borrowed (for a fee) and already sold for less money. This is a profitable strategy if the stock goes down. 

At the end of your contract, you need to provide an equivalent number of shares to the brokerage you borrowed them from. That's why shorts are fueling the price increase. They have to buy TSLA at a loss to make good on their shorts contracts. "
"They are highly motivated to not get into that position. That’s what the margin disclosure is telling you. They’re not going to take a bullet for you. In reality the margin call will probably come long before you hit zero. I believe that line is actually $25,000 at minimum by law. "
"Nah you are conflating intelligence with wealth. Also politicians do not have to be rich. They will corrupt the system for pennies.

Also some very dumb people are filthy rich.

I think he didn’t get his point across . What he was trying to say is do you see the American government restricting the sale of artificial intelligence to China in the same way that Elon/Spacex can’t sell a Physical Space rocket to China for national security reasons . As in can the car AI be used for other things if s outside entity got their hands in it . So the government would limit it . It’s a valid question but one only the government could answer . Elon himself is big on placing limitations or regulations on AI

So this analyst has a history of pushing towards outlandish ideas, and getting feedback that the question is right but not quite ready for light-of-day discussion.

I think he tried to do the same here, trying to get some color on potential future business plans outside of the current knowledge of the atmosphere. But this time he didn't get anywhere, Musk seems to be focused on execution right now and expansion beyond the spoken plan isn't really a major thought of his right now."

">Well ""they"" don't work together. ""They"" are a bunch of disparate investors, all looking out for their own investments.

I dislike the notion that just because people don't group up and secretly meet that it means they aren't working together. 

If 100 people all have the same goal then they don't need to group up or meet. For instance over an entire year 100 people each decide they want to live in a cleaner town and do their part. They pick up trash on their block without ever grouping up or planning anything. Suddenly the entire town is clean. 

It seems clear they worked together to accomplish that even though there wasn't a meeting or a plan or secret conspiracy. 

It sounds to me that these desperate investors all have the same goal and that they're all moving towards that goal individually. I would say that counts as working together.

"They bought it because it was Elon's brothers, he vouched for it, it was over-committed and vulnerable and had attracted shorts and lots of bad press, that then translated to Tesla. It's base business model was sound however, as the last 9 months have shown, once they trimmed costs and optimized it's focus."
"Hey, I'm all for anyone with a contrary opinion; those people can have some of the strongest turn-arounds if things change dramatically, and if they do, you know they'll cover the bad news *straight*.

Even Elon mentioned that they should be moving along better 15 years in. He's expecting profitability moving forward, so by the time Model Y production starts, Tesla should be on a *roll*. I'm excited to see if and/or how that pans out.

Yeah, there's some people who will dig around for any dirt no matter how good or bad things are, but there are plenty of people who will outright change their tune over time. It's easy to lose sight of that sometimes given how echo-chamber-like subs 'n sites can be.

The only way to give them back is to buy some, I.e. to cover the position. And covering the position implies taking the losses should the stocks price be higher than when you borrowed it — as that’s when the lender of the stock may become concerned or even have a contractual stop-loss where you must cover. But you know all that. You’re just a troll that got cornered a bit. And of course shorts only lose money when the stock goes **up**, not down. And yes, given the short position and the time it’s held on average, people do owe a lot of money to the market just to give the stocks back to the lenders of TSLA stock that were kind enough to lend to shorts.

Tesla doesn’t sell their product below cost. Do you know anything about how businesses account for costs?
"There are parallels between the companies. Amazon spent years of cap ex on building it's warehouses, improving supply chain and distribution to get them to the scale they are at now.

Tesla is in a similar position for a different industry. They have battery factory and manufacturing lines for the current models they produce, and should be able to scale volume production. Tesla also has really good margins are very expensive cars which will help their financials.

It will be interesting to see how they plan to produce enough batteries for the new products they announced (model y, Tesla truck, semi truck, and new roadster), as well a their manufacturing plans for those lines."

"Trust me, I'm going to throw a party when ICE cars die. However, I think you may be jumping the gun just a bit.

Yes, longevity, performance, convenience, OTA updates, Level 3 Autonomy, and stable fuel price are definitely arguments for Tesla. However those features currently exist.

I honestly believe that the biggest issue with electric is range, and that has improved considerably since they first hit the market, but it's still an issue. While 45 mins at a supercharging station is a lot compared to a gas station, it's a small price to pay for literally free fuel.

Ultimately, the market will have to decide, and that was the biggest hurdle for electric in the beginning. Tesla sweetened the deal with those features and, arguably most importantly, they made electric cars sexy. And holy shit they can't make them fast enough now.

But price and range still are the Achillies heel of electric cars. Those both come from the significant limitations of Li-ion batteries such as price, energy density, charging rate, environmental impact, and the dangers from being punctured. Useful energy storage has always been the limiting factor for any kind of device as far back as humans using teams of oxen to plow fields.

TLDR: Lithium ion is the weakest link on any electric car when compared to an ICE. When a better battery comes out, say goodbye to ICEs for the average consumer within 5-10 years."

The only way for another company to suddenly reveal a new battery tech that they and other manufacturers can already produce in volume, while Tesla gets stuck, is if they develop it from earliest concept totally in-house, all the way through getting a gigafactory up and running, with Tesla being completely oblivious to it.

* the experience other car makers have is in a different market, a Tesla is a very different beast to everything else out there.

* there is a huge moral support behind Musk and what he is trying to do.

* the huge investments Tesla has been making have given them at least a 2 year lead in battery manufacturing capacity, and in manufacturing techniques, (some learned very painfully from their mistakes) some of the others have learned from that, most have had their prejudices reinforced, which will mean they don't take the chances the need to catch up.

* from here on, many of those expensively bought advantages will start multiplying Tesla's lead, it will cost more money to get the Y rolling, but it will be a fraction of what they have spent so far, and the returns will be even better than for the 3. I suspect the semi will be even more of a gold mine."
"I don't think people dislike shorts as such, just the false FUD in the media.

Short the stock all you want but don't spread misinformation in the media to bolster your position.

I agree Tesla is hard to accurately value my my impression as a spectator is that there are a few simple differences between shorts and longs that explain the different opinions. 

1. Shorts are looking at short term Financials, longs are looking at the long term picture and revenue growth.

2. Shorts are negative about EVs in general and IMO wildly underestimate the real demand.

3. Longs have a better understanding of the Tesla business, I view the business as the fundamentals.

I am much more inclined to be long than short at present.

Even if you think Tesla is over valued there is a very good chance revenues will catch up and exceed the current valuation."

"I would disagree so far as gambling, as done in Atlantic City and Las Vegas, is designed explicitly to ensure that most people will walk away with far less money than they started with.

Yes, there are con artists and other scams which exist that you need to be aware of, and people who cook the books claiming numbers that don't match reality along with unsavory business practices that have a short term gain but long term pain with regards to the value of a company, but most people (fortunately) involved in corporate governance and are involved in the major stock exchanges simply wish to increase the value of their companies and at least attempt to be profitable.

You aren't placing a ""bet"" against the house when investing in companies through a stock exchange.  It also isn't like blackjack where doing something to improve your odds of success, like counting cards, is likely to get you kicked out of the game.  The more information you have and the more knowledge you can get about the products the company sells, the logistical problems they are facing about getting those products made, and what information you can know about the CEO and the top management of the company.... the more likely you will be making good investment decisions and not merely be throwing money to the wind.  Anybody who invests in stocks without doing that kind of research is simply being an idiot and fool."
"There are no contract terms though. You can hold shorted shares indefinitely, unless the pool of share lenders stops lending them out en masse.

No, I am not conflating them. I am calling the one an indicator of the other..

The wealthiest people on the planet are increasingly self made, dwarfing the oligarchs and oil barons and extractors of raw materials. There is no clear rule correlating the two, but it is definitely an indicator. You are conflating the term indicator with rule.

The main point I was making though, is in the broadening range of performance of individuals.  I can do 20 times as much as some of the dumb, lazy people I worked with in a day. Musk's engineers are probably 20 times more effective than me.  The gap in understanding and therefore performance between humans is broadening.... and the rate of this broadening is accelerating."

"> Why would a conservative dislike Tesla or Elon?

As someone who works in Solar PV, the conservative hate for Solar PV has always confounded me. Solar PV is the most independent, self-sufficient, fiscally responsible, free-market energy there is.

I mean I'm aware that it's most likely due to the decades-long fossil-fuel propaganda campaign against any alternative energy. It just always surprises me how effective it is."
"You sound like a “real” conservative, or perhaps a libertarian. Unfortunately the term “conservative” has taken on a different meaning in the past couple of decades, to the point it now just means “against anything liberals like.” And (un)fortunately liberals like some fairly common-sense things. "
"Conservatives like Tesla. Republicans hate Tesla. :(

(The GOP has become the party of Trump, but Americans still associate Republicans with conservatism)"
"> Why would a conservative dislike Tesla or Elon? 

As I said, I was talking specifically about, 

>>conservatives who a) want to troll liberals, who they perceive to be starry-eyed environmentalist weenies, and b) they get all their info from conservative media sites, which are unrelentingly negative on Tesla, EVs in general, solar, wind, etc.

So there are two reasons right there.    I am aware that some conservatives support EVs.   I didn't say or imply all conservatives were alike, rather I was clearly talking about a subset of conservatives.   

>Dont be so quick to judge.

I didn't judge anyone.  I noted a real-world trend I and others have seen.    

> Let's try and stop hating and judging each other

I didn't hate or judge you.  Please do not attribute to me positions or sentiments I did not express, or even hint at.   I was clearly talking about a subset of conservatives who are anti-Tesla, like to troll liberals, and get their information from consistently anti-Tesla conservative media sites.    It is a caricature to pretend that I was talking about *all* conservatives, or trying to put you in a box.   "

Not one single elected official who calls themselves ""a conservative"" shares your point of view.  It bothers me when smart people like you continue to hang on to this idea that you are a ""conservative,"" and you keep voting these people in who are 100% owned by oil.

"I've noticed more liberals around me hate on Elon Musk. Usually something about ""yea but all the electricity comes from fossil fuels"" or ""all the energy needed to make the cars are fossil fuels"". As if that is reason enough to continue to just building oil based cars, even if that were true. "

"Except that's not what he asked.  If one actually knows what the potentially relevant laws/regulations are it's a simple question to ask in such a way that is perfectly understandable and not sounding like insane hysteria:  ""Elon, are there any concerns about future government restrictions on sales/export over potential dual use applications?""  Or ""Elon, is there any danger of the AI technologies Tesla is developing falling under various export control regulations like EAR or ITAR?""  "
"Though Elon still answered that pretty well — the car’s AI is going to be heavily oriented towards safety, so for example all an enemy has to do is e.g. walk in front of it and it’ll stop and be pinned down.   Undoing that means retraining all those neural nets practically from scratch, so a potential military user really wouldn’t get much out of using the car as a starting point.

Of course I guess all that says is that Elon sees no *technical* reason for such a ban; doesn’t mean politicians won’t get scared and do it anyways. "
"Sure.  But they just went on length about replacing the Nvidia chip with an ASIC for self-driving.  A ""weapons grade AI"" that's mighty fine at driving is probably not #1 on the list of things not to sell to China."
"But that is not how neural nets work.

The code and processing power on the car side can't be really used for anything except running the self driving code. The really interesting stuff is done at Tesla HQ during the NN training. It is that code that a third party would need to make a terminator out of a Model3."
"You know what, maybe that's the a new short rhetoric: US will ban Tesla sales to China b/c they are too good!"

In that sense, Elon's best and most underrated skill is his ability to attract and find absolutely amazing talent."
Not an operating profit.  
As of now they are in the same category as a company like SNAP to me - interesting business model with potential but no actual results.  Anyone can sell a product for below cost.

The gigafactory is not the breakthrough. Building a giant factory to utilize economies of scale is not new. What would be new is developing new battery tech other than lithium ion and building the first factory for that
"This is all very good points and I agree 100%. The day a cheap battery with high energy density emerges, not only will ICE cars die, human technology as we know it will be radically revolutionized. We are on the same page.

What I'm saying is, with Model 3, 2018 is the year where BEVs begin to out perform ICEs on a dollar to dollar value, economically and practically for the general people. This is the tipping point, this is the beginning of the end for ICEs.

Just like you don't need AMOLED invented to say for sure that LCDs are replacing CRTs in the early 2000s, or digital cameras replacing film SLRs, you can now predict with 99%+ confidence that ICEs are slowly but surely dying, even if they still hold the bigger market share. That's what I meant.

Better batteries or not, it doesn't matter. Even if batteries stay exactly the same for the next 50 years, I guarantee you in 10 years you'll see at least 50%+ BEVs on the street and highways of US. That's what I meant."
"300 miles of real range at 75mph (which really means the 340+ that actual RWD Model 3 drivers are getting) makes road trips very similar to ICE.  It means any destination you would normally iron-butt it to without a stop are viable without charging, and it means you really do need a good break when it is time to charge.

My P85 w/ (degraded) 245 mile range is really more like 150 miles at 75mph because you don't get full range at 75mph, you can't supercharge it to 100% quickly, and you have to leave a little breathing room and recharge early.  That's not enough to road trip.  

The Model 3 LR will change everyone's perspective."
"Not so much range as prevalence of charging stations and charging time... If there were a bit more charging stations and charging time was 10 minutes for 300km, 350km range is no problem."
"The value of ICE cars as trade-ins will diminish faster now that EVs are making market inroads. 

That choice has never been part of the decision making process before, now its exists.

Everyone buying an ICE car today is going to feel it when they go to trade it in.  So it is a forcing function. "
"Slight nitpick, level 3 self-driving does not exist yet."
"Price and range hopefully it’s overcome in 2019. Model 3 standard range plus all these other companies and their 2020/21 models will be huge for the industry in getting thousands of people behind the wheel of an EV. 

It’s like Coca Cola in the early days. No one wanted it, but they started by giving free samples and people came back for more. 

Go drive any EV. It will change your perspective. 

You may “need” 300+ miles, but the reality is that the vast majority drive less than 60 miles a day. 
Thats 2/3 left on your 200 mi range. 

Of course it varies from person to person, but I bet most don’t spent 14 FULL days driving in a  year. (For me, anything further than 6 hours, I’d rather fly)

That’s 14/365 or 4% of the time. 

96% of the time, the range is not an issue at all, and this is what most people need to understand and the paradigm shift should come as more and more people get to know someone who owns a Model 3 (or any other EV). 

Exciting times ahead.

Long term investors in cash equities absolutely can make money via dividends. I’m not overly familiar as the products I used to broke were fixed income and interest rate derivative futures. 
"You are correct assuming investment funds are unlimited and stock prices rise indefinitely which is not the case. If you buy at $100 and then sell at $200 that $100 profit came from somewhere, so someone had invested that $100 and no longer has access to it because it is in the market."
"Yeah, everyone should do their own research. It's always a gamble if you are not well informed. If you think Tesla is gonna be bankrupt soon you shouldn't trade it and only because you like your new Model 3 also doesn't mean you should buy Tesla stock. "
"Its still gambling, the odds may be different, but Vegas gambling and stock market gambling are both still a form of gambling. 

In both stocks and Vegas gambling you are gambling money with the hope of getting more money, the only difference between the two is the odds. With Vegas gambling your odds of winning a particular bet is less than 50%, with stocks that number could be anywhere, and that percentage is really hard to estimate.

If we looked at any particular Vegas game, you could look up the odds, the math is well known when it comes to Vegas gambling. With stock you honestly have no idea what the win percentage is, its based mostly on opinions. If we looked at what people thought of TSLA you would get odds from 0% all the way to 100%. If we looked at the odds of betting on black at roulette, its always 47.4% chance of winning. 

At lest in Vegas you know the odds, with the stock market you really don't, all you can do is make an educated guess."
"*edit* Your edit makes it clear you do understand what a margin call is, never mind!

If indefinite and permanent shorted funds were possible, everyone one planet would be  trillionaires instantly, only fools  would avoid free money without risk or responsibility.  "
"Sure, there's a cool product for almost any use case on the market. But I think it's a lot more clear to explain how to short something the classic way. It all works the same at the end of the day. When you execute a short, you're becoming liable for a stake in something you don't own and can't cover without buying shares or some product that has that effect. If the shorted thing crashes in price you did well. If it increases you do not. 

Tesla is overpriced in terms of what they currently make vs other car manufacturers. The shorts are not wrong there. But the market can remain irrational longer than anyone can remain solvent. And then you can fundamentally misunderstand what drives the valuation. They compare Tesla to other car companies. But Tesla isn't really a car company. It's a lifestyle company and a technology company merged with a manufacturing group. They work more like Apple than GM. They sell you a product that works differently than the others and looks cooler, at a premium price. Apple almost went bankrupt 20 years ago. Michael Dell famously said ""What would I do? I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders.""

Apple is now the world's most valuable company. "

The broker has the right to decide which positions to close, including any short positions

In what world is a broker not needing consent to close a position the same as being able to hold for as long as you want?

If you're down for traditionally 'safe' investments, someone mucking up the situation for conventional automakers, petroleum companies, etc really complicates the situation.    

No one really knows when oil demand will plateau, how successfully Tesla and other EV makers can expand production, how cheap batteries can get, whether EVs will reach sticker-cost parity any time soon, and so on.   Way too many unknowns for someone to stand at the front of the room and give a good Powerpoint presentation on market projections for even 5 years out.   

Lots of people make their living looking like they know what's going on.    You wouldn't be much of an analyst if you couldn't convey confidence in your model.    But analysts like Tony Seba are dismissed as fanboys and starry-eyed dreamers, even if their predictions so far on battery cost decreases have bee too modest.

I couldn't agree more.  There's isn't much more obviously independent than breaking off of the power grid.  It's simply fossil fuel money that is pushing an anti PR campaign that has been exceptionally effective.  The fossil fuel money is pushed through the GOP so public sentiment is that Republicans and conservatives are pro-fossil fuels.

"That's the problem with identifying to an ideology or religion.  These outline a framework, and it is assumed that those who aspire to follow that framework, do so from a place of pure objectivity.  People bring their own bias and self interest to everything that they touch. When their interest is biased towards or against something, their ideology/religion is typically distorted to match that personal viewpoint.  That's how you can have a conservative ideology, and yet vilify something that would actually jive well with conservatism (as in your example of Solar PV). It's confounding when people are so corrupted in their objectivity, and yet argue and espouse the tenets of a religion/ideology."
"True.  It's sad that being liberal or conservative is viewed as a cuss word or an insult.  People are too quick to load preconceived opinions based on a label, for getting the no label can encapsulate the entirety of a person's experiences.  We are all different and all the same.  The vocal minorities have done a good job of shouting down the more common sentiments that the vast majority of us share.  Almost all of the extreme positions from both sides are untenable when objectively examined in the light of day (and a dash of sense).  We are more alike than unalike, but instead of commonalities bringing people together we have somehow been swayed to use our minor differences as judgement against character as a whole.  It is modern bigotry."

I think that he (Elon) is upsetting many old money industries and it's really just big money that's trying to turn public sentiment against him.

George Washington was against a party system and I would have to agree.  It's too easily corrupted.  When I say conservative I am not relating it to a specific party.  

I don't know the way out. I am optimistic and understanding with all things with the exception of politics and politicians specifically.

A reason that people hate on Elon is because he is not polished and is not easy to put in a box.  He is not a Democrat, nor is he a Republican. He is an American.  He scares everyone that is in any type of power.  He is independent, not beholden to anyone. He isn't scared of anyone either and has earned a very large following because of his deeds.  How many other people in power get there from deeds?  Almost no big business CEOs, no politicians, no one from Hollywood or media fame.  If those people dont fear him, then they are likely jealous.  He isn't succumbing to pressure and hatred.  He is what America is about and, from what I have observed, the hatred seems to be coming from both parties while he appears to represent the best aspects from each.

"Yeah, Volkswagen would have the capital to throw stuff against the wall to see what sticks.

I guess it’s possible that a startup like that could get a patent on a method that can’t be competed with very well without infringing, but this space seems to have a lot of variables to play with, so I don’t know how likely that is.  Also of course it depends on how well Tesla picks technologies to pursue.

Anyways, sure it’s possible. But again that would represent Tesla dropping the ball (like Kodak did)."

"One of the ways they can weigh the company down is by suppressing the share price therefore making the cost of new capital raises more dillutive (need to sell more shares to raise the same amount of money.)

Another is by reducing the access to debt markets by pushing the market to believe that Tesla's debt is more likely to default, thereby increasing the interest rates Tesla needs to borrow at and reducing the available creditors.  

Tesla needs to keep growing right now, and to do that they need a lot of cash to keep building factories, charging, maintenance and sales infrastructure, and of course R & D.  Reducing or making more expensive the access to capital will have a significant effect on the company."
"We arent talking about anybody in specific.  Somebody wanted to know what it meant to short a stock, somebody else said there is unlimited risk when shorting a stock.  I was clarifying that puts are a way to short a stock with limited risk."
"People should tone it down a bit, and have some respect.

Tesla fans probably got annoyed that shorts were trying to destroy the company, but that isn't happening.

I can respect sensible debate and logical argument around price.

If a short makes well reasoned logical arguments, they should be respected.

Also some poor people are investing their money with fund managers, who may be taking big risks, and may destroy their clients wealth. 

Regardless of what I think if the manager, I feel sorry for any clients if that happens."
"Right, it’s still not the same as a transaction in a casino or a betting shop where someone wins and someone else loses.

If the value of a share goes up, everyone who owns shares gets richer on paper.  No-one is losing the equivalent money anywhere (unless they have sold short of course).  Historically, this does happen indefinitely (on average)."
"Tesla also has a whole bunch of fanbois and other folks who have sort of bought into the cult of Elon Musk.  That has driven up the price of TSLA shares considerably beyond what might normally be happening with a much more conservative investor base.

The trick is to know if the current valuation is genuinely overinflated by those fans or if there is some genuine merit in the numbers that are happening.  It may even be reasonable to be thinking that in spite of the fact that Tesla is doing well, that the stock price is still far too high to be justified by the revenue and capital costs involved.

On the other hand, all of those Elon Musk fans are also a massive source of capital for Tesla to draw from if the need arises.   A major public offering of additional shares is likely to get gobbled up if necessary for the company."
"I guess in the sense that any entrepreneurial endeavor in which you risk some capital that has the potential of losing.  For example, a farmer who plants corn or wheat has no idea if he will ever get anything at all out of the field he is planting, or somebody who opens a gasoline station or a bakery that anybody may even buy their products.

The major exchanges though involve companies who have already proven themselves to a large degree and have shown for the most part they are rather conservative with their money and generally are making fairly sound investing decisions that have a proven track record.   Sure, there are differences between companies, but the ""odds"" of getting a positive return is pretty good.  Somebody simply taking a list of every company on an exchange and throwing darts to decide what companies to invest into will on the whole tend to make a profit.  The longer you keep the money in a company, the more likely you will earn a profit and it will typically outpace inflation from an historical perspective too.

The longer you stick with placing a bet on that black roulette space keep holding it, the more likely you will lose.  At least with the stock market, making an educated guess actually gets you somewhere."
"Professional investors spread the risk, they don't put all their money into one stock.

And they don't put money into stocks they don't understand.

It is a series of low risk bets that on aggregate is fairly safe.

The rest of us use fund managers that often do the same job sometimes better but usually worse and charge us fees. But they have such a spead that on average performance follows the market.

The big risk with financial markets is timing, don't invest money you may need short term."

I know there is some ""gender issues"", but to me those seem barely relevant to the average citizen and mostly hyped up by the right to have something to rage against. No talk about redistribution of wealth, except what acceptable progressive tax rates are. No nationalization of industries, except maybe some form of single payer health care. But that seems to work OK in e.g my country, thus can hardly be called untenable. On gun control, the discussion seems to be if students and teachers should be armed or not. Ok, I exaggerate on that one. But I'm asking what are some of the extreme left policies serious democrats are actually fighting for?
I know those more extreme female won a somewhat recent election, but that seems kinda necessary to keep public discourse balanced in the middle after the republican party shifted that far right since Bush senior.

> What is a 'Stock Loan Fee'
> A stock loan fee, or borrow fee, is a fee charged by a brokerage firm to a client for borrowing shares. A stock loan fee is charged pursuant to a Securities Lending Agreement that must be completed before the stock is borrowed by a client (such as a hedge fund or retail investor).
>         
> BREAKING DOWN 'Stock Loan Fee'
> The stock loan fee amount depends on the difficulty of borrowing a stock – the more difficult it is to borrow, the higher the fee. Since short sellers immediately sell the borrowed stock, the borrower must reassure the lender by putting up collateral such as cash, Treasuries, or a letter of credit from a U.S. bank.     "
That's why I said 10 years. By 2028 you'll have plenty of under 20k or under 15k used Model 3s. ALONE. Not counting new mass market BEVs or Leafs (Leaves?)

They will say anything that gets them air time and special interest money.  These two things have driven a wedge between the average American, who is mostly center leaning.  We want to identify with a party, however the parties do not adequately portray logical positions.  The American people are not as bad as is portrayed, however the American political apparatus may be worse than is commonly thought.  Overall, I find it to be a frustrating and scary situation.  Politicians from both parties espouse ideals that they dont believe and use divisive hyperbole in order to reinforce beliefs in the bogeyman that is the racist uneducated redneck or yuppy out of touch snowflake of the other party.  The system is sickening, and is heavily pushed on us.  It's hard for most of us to pull back and realize that someone with a differing opinion is a real person worthy of consideration.

1. That's exactly how [gross/net exposure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gross-exposure.asp) works, which you can learn if you did a little Googling. Net exposure equals long minus short, or $200 minus $100 in this case, which is net 100%. The Investopedia article I linked explains it in more detail. 
2. This has nothing to do with naked shorting...like, at all.

I'm very aware of what a stock loan fee is. Right now, the borrow fee on TSLA is right around 2%/yr, which is where it has been for awhile. That's actually offset almost entirely by what you can earn on cash invested in U.S. T-bills, which is called a [rebate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-loan-rebate.asp).

"I think you have a valid point here. And it's something I have never thought about before. I think there might be a way to define a fleets value. For example: what is the value of all prius's from now to 2008(10 years). How could one compare 10 years of model 3s would be the next step. This would be a great way to determine the relative cost of BEVs vs ICEs. I'm guessing if Musk is right about maintenence costs, depritiation may lead to a longevity of value in model3s that leads to a lower relative cost for buying one new. That being said, to me it makes sense that the top 5 cars traded in are value cars besides the BMW. "

>BREAKING DOWN 'Net Exposure '
A low net exposure does not necessarily indicate a low level of risk, since the fund may have a significant deal of leverage. For this reason, gross exposure (long exposure + short exposure) should also be considered, as the two measures together provide a better indication of a fund’s overall exposure.

So your example is bullcrap.

Why would you need to short TSLA with margin in order to buy an additional $100 of SPY, especially if it's going sideways? Why not just use the margin directly and save the borrow fee and additional risk?

> Right now, the borrow fee on TSLA is right around 2%/yr, which is where it has been for awhile.

"Fraud is a strong word. Anyone who lost money on those bonds is free to file a complaint with the SEC, I suppose."
There is absolutely no fraud.  Tesla will repay PAR value plus their 5.3% interest rate in 2025 when they mature.  Bond holders don't lose anything unless they sell them for less than they paid for them.  All of this action is trading the bonds that Tesla already sold.  So if I go out now and buy a $1K bond at 88% of the par value I will only pay $880 for a bond that Tesla will be paying back at $1000 plus 5.3% interest.  Makes sense?

I completely understand how bonds work. Making outlandish claims you can't deliver on to raise money is the issue.
It is if it’s $25 billion a year. Have you actually looked into Tesla’s financial situation?
"Yes.  Tesla has an accumulated deficit (essentially total losses) of $5.77 billion.  It will take them something like a decade to earn that money back, if not longer.  Taking 20+ years to break even is not great, and that is assuming things go great for the company going forward."
"You think it will take Tesla a decade to earn around $6 billion? I would be interested to hear your assumptions. They had revenue of $4 billion last quarter, and they are producing cars a lot faster this quarter. If they achieve a margin of around 25% on the model 3 like they plan, they’ll probably be earning at least $6 billion a year on vehicle sales for their current lineup."
"> They had revenue of $4 billion last quarter,

They also lost over $700 million last quarter.

> and they are producing cars a lot faster this quarter.

And they may still lose money this quarter.

> If they achieve a margin of around 25% on the model 3 like they plan

I don't really see that happening.  First of all, you mean ""gross margins"" - the company will never, ever achieve 25% actual margins.  Don't worry, everyone on this sub seems to make that mistake.  Anyway, the company keeps pushing out the date they are going to be able to achieve those gross margins.  Originally they said it would be when they are producing 5k cars a week.  Now they are saying maybe by the end of the second quarter of 2019.  By that time they will have to be selling a ton of sub $40k variants of the car to keep the production numbers up (particularly as the federal subsidies go away), and that will crush their gross margins. 

> they’ll probably be earning at least $6 billion a year on vehicle sales for their current lineup.

And if their gross margins only hit 20% their gross profit will only be $4.8 billion, which will be almost completely wiped out by their SG&A and R&D costs.  Those costs in the last quarter were $1.14 billion.  If you assume that goes up 3% in 2019, the annual cost is $4.7 billion.  Tesla eeking out a profit of $100 million or so in 2019 isn't going to do much to recover the $5.7 billion of losses they've accumulated to date."
"We are talking about whether or not Tesla is selling cars at a loss. You are confusing the difference between the company being profitable as a whole and a particular product line being profitable over its lifetime.

That is not correct. Only the costs related to the specific vehicle line should be considered when you are determining whether the vehicle is making a profit or a loss. 

A company can be working on many products, which can all be in various stages of development. Just because they are spending a bunch of money developing new products doesn’t mean their existing products are unprofitable.

> Agreed, but Tesla is not selling their cars at nearly high enough of a margin to make their investment back and make a profit.  That is my entire point....

I would really like to know how you’ve figured that, because by all appearances, they are definitely making money on S/X, and probably on 3 as well by this point.

> Sure dude, you just won't say what any of them are because???

"> A company can be working on many products, which can all be in various stages of development. Just because they are spending a bunch of money developing new products doesn’t mean their existing products are unprofitable.

Sure, but if they spent a bunch of money developing one product, and they can't recoup the development costs, that product is by definition unprofitable even if they sell it for more than the production cost.  

> I would really like to know how you’ve figured that, because by all appearances, they are definitely making money on S/X, and probably on 3 as well by this point.

Yeah, that $1.4 billion loss last half must have just been a weird fluke, right?

Again, lost $1.4 billion so far this year.  Lost $5.7 billion since they formed.  Operating losses every single year of their existence.  Never once turned a profit in even consecutive quarters.  But oh yeah, absurd to think they are selling cars at a loss.  "
"> they can't recoup the development costs

Why are you assuming this is the case?

> Yeah, that $1.4 billion loss last half must have just been a weird fluke, right?

Yes. They've been working on getting production on Model 3 up to speed. In the meantime, they've been paying for employees and equipment to make far fewer cars than they'd planned. But things were very different through July, and their financial picture will probably look really different in Q3 as a result.

> Again, lost $1.4 billion so far this year.

Again, that doesn't tell you whether the cars are being sold at a loss. This isn't rocket science. Just think about it for two damn seconds."
