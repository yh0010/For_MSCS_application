"I would love a Model 3 coupe option.  This looks gorgeous.
"
"Look how far back the driver is positioned in the vehicle. That's a weight distribution to balance a front engine... like in nascar.

But pushing the front seats into the back seats to make a huge frunk would actually be pretty cool. 
"
"Looks neat. I wonder why they didn't go with the new nose though, I feel like it fits the overall design better, since this concept a bit more angular than vanilla Model S."
Is that a UFO in the background? I want to believe.
Looks like an electric Maserati. 
This...this is what Tesla needs to do next. 
"I follow this guy on Instagram.  He posts some pretty cool car stuff!

[source](https://www.instagram.com/rainprisk/)"
Give it a facelift
"I think it looks good, but I also *don't* think a regular Model S looks worse. Assuming this coup√© seats less than half the people of a regular Model S, I feel this concept only takes away, but adds nothing.

Nicely done graphics though!"
I'm impressed. This is a great design!
"Model S for sedan, Model C for coupe?"
Would like tk see it with an updated front 
"If they made a model S wagon, they would never be able to produce enough of them for customers.

Although, I *guess* the Model X is in the small ""crossover"" range, which might fit the same bill."
My dick is confirmed erect.
"be still my heart.

It's like best parts of tesla, aston martin, and maserati all put together."
"Looks brilliant, but I can't see Tesla making the back window that angular."
Congratulations on doing what no one thought possible: Making the Model S even sexier.
"Wouldn't be surprised to see the Roadster 2 look something like this, though smaller and with the Model 3 front end. That would be pretty awesome, the R P75D MP (maximum plaid). 0-60 in 2.2 seconds. 300 mile range.

75 kWh battery to reduce weight. Also a lighter car than the S by a significant amount, so can go farther with less battery."
Beautiful. 
Pretty sure that's a re-skinned Aston Martin.
I would buy this Tesla
"This is concept art, not a concept vehicle, right? It is beautiful. "
Holy shit that is sexy.
"Where did Tesla's designers come from? Any particular company? Or are these home-grown (self-seeked) designers?

Because this is the nicest fucking car I've seen."
"It's funny that there are performance breaks, as Tesla's don't really use it much."

"New here and curious, does anyone make ""racing"" parts for these cars? Seems like that are already are maxed from the factory. "
Fisker Karma meets Model S.
"Would 100% buy this. 

Would also buy something similar as a body kit for a current gen Model-S"
Ohh... do want.
Shut up and take my money! 
YOU KNOW WHAT. I was just wondering the other day what a two door version of the Model S would look like. I think I needs an update to the new nose but this is actually really awesome.
Looks like it has enough room for a nice Small-block V8 to go in it. 
I like that alot.
I'd buy it in a heartbeat
"Lol, ya typo Brakes"
"Hell yeah, [S Coupe](http://www.uneedapart.com/images/hyundai-scoupe-parts.jpg)!"
"If Musk did that, the world could fuck off. It is effing gorgeous!"
what's up with the fanged grill?
Shut up and take my money.
"Well, shit. I've been working on a similar project but I'd been delayed because of school. Mine's still different though, should I post it here when I finish?"
Kinda hot. But kill that grill!
"Oh lordy, that's magnificent. "
I NEED THAT. RIGHT GODDAMN NOW. WHY IS IT NOT IN MY DRIVEWAY YET
"This is great. It would seem electric drivetrains are perfect to make whatever kind of car you want. A low slung coupe may need to get creative with where the battery packs are but since it doesn't need to be practical it can still be low and evenly weighted. It doesn't even need to drive the front wheels to compete with its segment. I, for one, welcome our electric sports cars future. "
Preorder now ship estimate 2099
"Cut off the roof call it the roadster, coming in 2023"
Hhhnnnngghh....
Can someone tell me why the calipers positioned the way the are? 
Looks like the Road concept 1 imo
[I photoshopped it with the new front.] (http://imgur.com/a/09N6t)
that is a good looking car 
Look nice but sadly is too expensive. Still nice.
"Looks great, but the notion that you need all that bulk forward of the front axle is a bit... legacy.  I'd shorten the nose by about 8"""
Reminds me of a Panamera.
Oh man.. I need to make more money 
This is why its crazy to even consider an Austin Martin. With everything shifting electric / autonomous there is no reason to buy a high end 2 seater
"I love the coupe what about a Cameron type!
Sports car market at a decent price and lots more HP. I would bet this car and other tesla sport models will be very very popular!"
That nosecone tho....
"Beautiful, the design is finally catching up. "
Damn that looks fresh af
I really want a Tesla supercar... or hypercar.
OH MY.
"looks very good. but it will never happen, not like this. this is the design language derived form the huge front engine GT cars of past. there is no reason to still use a huge bonnet like this on modern evs. the model s got it because its a steppingstone from old to new. thats why it had the faux grille it now got rid of. expect the successor of model s to have a way shorter front."
"This would be ground breaking, efficient, fast and beautiful. Too bad EV needs to be hihly practical like diesels."
"Wow. I don't like teslas one bit, but your rendering/design is really top notch. 
I drive a CL55 AMG, and the looks of your prototype got me pretty jelly haha. 
You would do well at a design firm, you clearly have the skill to make what you visualize into actual illustrations, and a good eye for proportion and lines. Nice work man, keep it up!"

I don't want my Model 3 anymore. I want this.

Probably wasn't out yet when they started the project.
"Well, were you able to identify it? If not, and it's flying, then yes!"
It's a falcon 9 taking off
That's just schmutz on the camera.
If it is a UFO behind the background firmware 8 would be able to see it.
"Must have been what Elon was talking about during the press meeting yesterday about the new Autopilot being able to see a UFO. ;)

~~I personally wish it were a TARDIS, though.~~"
I was thinking it looked a lot like an Aston Martin
"Personally, I think it looks very similar to the F-Type coupe "
"http://imgur.com/XC3RWRe
Here is the Model III and an Aston Martin. "
I think it looks like a 6 series coupe. Very sexy. 
"How is such a insult voted this high? Let's put this on its own pedestal, this is a Tesla and if anything the Maserati looks like a tesla."
This is what the next Roadster should be based on.
What? Add more drag? 
"That hatchback mustang is glorious!

Thanks! I'm thinking of making a convertible version of the coupe soon too

"A Tesla wagon would be my next car if they made it, but I think you severely overestimate the popularity of wagons, at least in the States. Hopefully the Euro demand is enough to make it happen. "
Damn I'd love a wagon. Daaaaaaaaaaaamn
[Concept](http://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/tesla-model-s-wagon-looks-brilliant-too-bad-it-wont-happen-102925_1.jpg)
"I'd love a Model S wagon but I don't think its going to happen. There won't be that much more space because the S is already more or less a Shooting Brake. The S coupe is more likely than a wagon.

But I bet that the 3 platform will get a wagon and a coupe."
Wagons aren't as popular with the general crowd as you'd think... It's mostly car enthusiasts who love them so much.
If they make a Tesla Hot Hatch like the Honda Fit with great performance then I'd see that being successful.
Hard agree. Pretty sure they will stick to their brand image from now on.
"The lead designer's been around: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_von_Holzhausen?wprov=sfla1

This image is not a Tesla product though, not sure who made it"
"> It's funny that there are performance breaks, as Tesla's don't really use it much.

Well, breaking performance would really hurt Tesla's image, don't you think?

If on the other paw, you meant to say ""brakes"", that makes more sense."
"I would sincerely doubt it, these cars do not fare well on anything resembling a track for very long."
"People are making a mistake by shortening the wheelbase. You can't do that due to the battery. The wheelbase must stay the same. Instead, lengthen the hood like the AMG GT. That would be something. "
"Well, I mean, the Model S is already all of those things..."
Diesels are only practical in North America. Europe has everything in diesels. I'd love it if Tesla released a coupe
"I'm the guy behind this, and thank you! Doing those pictures just as a hobby though"
I'd love to see this mock-up with the new nose...
I wasn't a huge fan of the grill on the original Model S - I prefer the new one - but man it would look perfect on a car this size.
It reminds me how much I hated the grill.
chill with the grill

And a tiny crumple zone in the back.
"I started with it last week, it's just a photoshopped picture based on the Model S. Why I kept the old nose is because I personally just like the old one a little better (although I haven't actually seen the new one on the streets yet, just on the photos)"
"Yeah, that seems likely"
I identified it as an unidentified flying object.
I been saying this for some time now.  If Tesla has the means they should buy Aston Martin.  That interior craftsmanship with the Tesla drive train.  Have you used the Aston Martin configurator?
"IDK about the F type so much as maybe an XK, it's a bit too bulbous for an F Type."
"Xk perhaps, not f type "
"I respectfully disagree.  The next Roadster should be a sports car -- small and nimble.  At least 18"" shorter wheelbase and other 
dimensions to match.

A coup√© would be a welcome addition to Tesla's range, but less welcome than a real sports car.

Where's the additional drag coming from?
"Lets also not forget that the best performance cars don't necessarily aim for the least drag possible. . Hypermiling eco cars do, but drag as a result of appropriate downforce yields a more stable and faster vehicle. "
Eww.
That would not sell in the US. Truck owners would never buy that.
Shit quality but you get the idea: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZOVRMa9VpQ
"Yeah, that is sort of what I meant above. I think wagons have been declining somewhat in the US in the past 5 years, ever since the ""crossover"" concept came about. Automakers finally moved away from making SUV's on truck chassis, and scaled up a standard passenger unibody to something that was not quite a sedan, not quite a van, not quite an SUV. At least out here in CA, they have become fairly popular. 

And the Model X really isn't very big, it is more of a ""crossover"" class than a full SUV."
"I dunno, man. In the northwest, like 40% of cars are Wagons, mostly Subaru."
The Mercedes estate is fucking loved 
"Oh, I've seen plenty of concepts. I think they were floating around *shortly* after the S launch and before any Model X talk, since so many people wanted them.

also ... those tires are ridiculous."

I seem to see some kind of protruding fin under the headlight. Or am I seeing it wrong? 
Not too happy with how it looks either but it strikes me as a style that probably grows on you
I'm not sure if any north american owner would buy that...
Aussies would though.
"It'd definitely sell in Australia though, a lot of our utes already look the very similar (see Ford Falcon Ute). "
i would
"Considering Subaru's overall market share, I suspect your intuitive estimate is a bit off. Plus the Outback and Forester have migrated toward the CUV side (not that it isn't appropriate for their intended use).

I recently bought a wagon living in the Southeast. It is very difficult to find a true wagon without the extra inches of ground clearance (and AWD) I don't need in my neck of the woods. 

A single motor Model 3 wagon would be just about perfect for my needs. "
"But if you look at the number of cars that are sold in the US each year, and how many of them are wagons, it doesn't paint a great picture."
"Honest question, what makes the X not a wagon? "
Left photoshop open for 2 hours and absolutely nothing happened. Please advise.
"That's a fair point, but it's fast enough for ordinary use, wouldn't you say? Iirc the top speed is capped at 155mph, and that's pretty damn fast unless you're planning on taking it to the track every weekend."
What? It's an incredibly fast car. 0-60 in 2.8 seconds with a top speed ~ 160mph
"That's an eye of the beholder thing, I guess. I think the facelifted Model S sedan is sexy as hell as is. A coupe would be just as beautiful, but with less space."
"fuck, that's gorgeous. 
"
"It doesn't look so bad!
Awesome job btw!"
I'd buy this 
"Incredible! Thanks for doing that. To my taste, that is 1000x sexier"
"Do want. 

I mean, this beauty isn't even *blue* and I'm fawning over it. <3"
"No no no, this is a super car. Fill it with more battery. 

P180D anyone?

Also comes with a new launch mode called 'Who needs attached retinas anyway'. "
"Nah, gotta be filled with bubble wrap."
That's a nascar
Confetti and balloons!

Snap oversteer would like a word with you.
"If I'm going to do a convertible, I'll put the new nose on it "
The Vantage starts at $100k.   Not a cheap car but it is in Tesla price territory.
The BRZ/FRS and Miata/Fiata would be an interesting base for the Tesla Roadster 2.0
"Probably not in the short term. They now have the capital to aim at the midrange market, and i think they want to start focusing on the midrange market more and more to avoid the (started by tesla) ""electric cars are for rich people"" stigma"
"If they had the same batteries it would weigh a lot, probably too much for a sports car tbh. As far as I am aware the actual engines weigh almost nothing compared to the batteries. "
"The roadster was reasonably popular, but I think now it's even more popular since you can't buy one new but the company still exists.

I figure they will eventually get a Roadster 2, but currently their plan is clearly mass market manufacture and lower price.

In all seriousness, I fucking love that their first roadster was just a lotus with their own drivetrain and a few other things. If they did that for a second roadster, it'd be kind of a distraction - they'd basically be saying that they're doing it as a side project - but on the other hand, it might not take too much resources.

I'd lay even odds on their next roadster being either a fairly cheap model (kind of on the miata price scale of electric vehicles) or a six-figure luxury model. Hard to guess. Both would have its adherents. Cheap would be mass-market, whereas expensive would be halo."
You don't know how cars work do you?
That's to redirect airflow so it is possible that it even reduces drag.
North American.  No. Only people who like a the el Camino have a chance at liking this concept. 
It's clearly targetted at an Australian/UK audience.  Like the Maloo.
it's an aussie thing. and yes still hideous.
"Well. Yeah. My off the cusp statement is definitely not even remotely scientific. I know that. 

I would definitely love a Tesla wagon. Would be beautiful and functional. Would be great."
It's too tall?
"Can't put anything on the roof, perhaps?"
Wagons should have a squared off rear roof section to maximize storage (and passenger space if applicable). The S's rear end has made functional sacrifices in the name of aero and aesthetics.

"Fast: Top Speed

Quick: How long it takes to get there

It's not a particularly fast car, almost all of the German sports sedans are electronically limited (Just like all versions of the Model S, although earlier models could only reach 130mph) to 155mph. A Charger Hellcat, on the other hand, tops out at over 200mph.

The Model S is fucking quick, but fast it's not."
You also have to remember that batteries weigh a lot which severely compromises handling.

"ELON, can you hear us?

"As I'm only a casual Tesla fanboy since ownership is a mere pipe dream right now, is that what the different numbers mean; battery capacity?"
I'm curious what sort of tire they are going to need to match further acceleration improvements.
We have had conversations.
Fiata?
"And for the love of all things holy, it needs to be able to complete one full lap at Nurburgring under full power. Right now, Tesla is nothing more than a company which makes family sedans that have one cool trick: a quick 0-60.  If the Roadster 2.0 can post a respectable Nurburgring time, *then* Tesla will be considered a true sports car. "
"As I have this strange fascination with the BRZ, I would love to see this.

I dunno, when I see one, I just think, ""Damn, I'll bet that's a fun little fucker to drive."""
"> In all seriousness, I fucking love that their first roadster was just a lotus with their own drivetrain and a few other things.

Don't tell Elon this. It started as a Lotus, but the ended up gutting it almost entirely after the original design just wouldn't work.

Small wonder it still looks like a Lotus. And they're very proud about this."
"> I think now it's even more popular since you can't buy one new but the company still exists.

McLaren has made quite a fortune based on that. "
"This was made by a graphic artist in photoshop, not an engineer in the real world. Everything is purely cosmetic."
"Correct, probably directs airflow over that mirror. "
My guess is that it's supposed to be an intake for cooling the front brakes. 
"Australia, however..."
Oh oh oh! That's me! :D
"as somebody who owns an el camino, i've always said i'm not buying a new truck until i can get a ute again. i hate monolithic trucks. i was so hype for the pontiac G8 ute.

"When is anyone going close to 160? Why do people care about top speed when it is so far from legal speed limits?
It's just a gratuitous claim with no real effect on your use of the car. Acceleration is much more useful (albeit also gratuitous given how ridiculously quick it is)."
"It's fast for a sedan. Not for a sports car. Unless your on the Audubon, your limited way below 100 mph anyways, so it really doesn't matter. Unless I suppose you like illegal street racing, or schedule driving on a private track. "
"CC?

Speaking of, have you seen the Model S convertible?"
With extra cooling for track days!  I'll take the hit of 0.3 sec 0-60 for the cooling weight.
"Yes, but with increased capacity *generally* comes with more cells in parallel, meaning more power available as well. So most of the larger capacity packs are also capable of higher current and therefore faster acceleration"
Yes
New Fiat 124 is based on the 2017 (ND)  Miata. 
"The Fiat 124 Spider is based off the ND Miata but uses a Fiat engine and NC Miata manual transmission.  

Just calling it the Fiata "
"Yeah, Mazda and Fiat partnered to use the Miata ND base to build the Fiat 124. Infact, this is starting to become a thing with manufacturers at least for sports cars. Toyota and Subaru partnered for the BRZ and FRS. Toyota and BMW are partnered and in the process of making a new Supra/Z4 or Z5. "
"Not every sports car should be tuned on the same track. The Miata isn't tuned on the 'Ring, and people seem to like it. The BRZ wasn't tuned to go faster, it was tuned to be fun at real-world speeds."
"I don't care if it can't lap The Ring, just give me something that I can quickly charge, have good 0-60 & quarter mile times, and can handle well.  

I don't want any gimmicky falcon doors or proximity sensing door handles. "
"They are fun to whip around on their Prius tires. Chris Harris did a video of a C63 AMG drifting around a track on 125 spare tires all around.  

The ToyBaru just feels good like that. It's not nearly as bad as people say. The torque dip is pretty horrible, but it's basically Toyota's attempt at a 240sx/Hard too Miata.  
Once these have swap kits out, they're going to be VERY fun."
"www.lefthandutes.com

If you're gonna buy one, do it now, the last Falcon ute has already rolled off the line and the Commodore Ute's run is ending next year."
Lol. Toping 160 is easy on highway.
">It's fast for a sedan. 

Except it's not, almost all of BMW, Audi's, and Mercedes US Lineup is electrically limited to the same speed. 

When you're talking about a Camry or something maybe, but the cheapest Model S is about $50k off of being in the same price bracket and really aren't comparable in any fashion.

155mph is only 75% of the way to the Charger's top speed, so I don't exactly see how the two are competing."
Nope. Where are images? 
"Just looked it up, wild car."
"Wow, never seen that before. That looks great. "
"I noticed that the Scion and Subaru are basically the same car.  Seems strange that competitors would work together, but I just read that the Next Corvette is going to have a 10-speed transmission developed jointly by GM and Ford.  Strange bedfellows indeed."
"i am aware of them, [i've actually linked their website in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/4zbtym/on_chevrolets_own_page_an_illustration_of_how_big/d6v2lwc)

they operate right near me, something like 20 minutes. i've watched their website for awhile, i've had my eyes on one of the 4 door crewman models for a long time. "
"> Lol. Toping 160 is easy on highway.

We're not talking of KM/H here.

On what US highway do you reach 160 MPH?"
"http://autoweek.com/article/drive-reviews/tesla-model-s-convertible-first-drive

Personally, I'm not a fan. It's a cool concept and all but the execution leaves something to be desired, I think."
"Well it makes sense in a few ways. The BRZ has a nicer interior, but the GT86/FRS can be had for cheaper.  

As for the Corvette, the GT500 & ZL1 will be sharing a transmission so I assume it'll be the same one in the Corvette."
"Huh. How much do those imported Crewman go for?

They're pretty far from desirable down here so I'm curious what that translates too."
"First of all i'm not in USA, also I don't how I would live there when state troopers will kill me for that. 

Here (in Croatia) i can step on it and get out without any serious problem. 

155 mph is like A6 3.0TDi speed... With 700hp or more I expect Lamborghini speeds at least."
"Butt ugly.

Still waiting for good CC render and by CC i mean comfort coupe (like Passat CC, Audi A5, BMW 6 GC)..."
"it seems to vary a lot, i've yet to find one i want to jump on. i already have a sporty 2 door ute ('82 el camino SS, 5.0L V8) so i want one i can also carry people in. only other choice for that is a subaru baha and the beds on those are kinda lame. plus i live right up the hill from boulder, which is subaru mecca, so i kinda want something less bland. 

them not being desirable down there kinda works in my favor but i guess we'll see. "
"First, no, you wouldn't be killed for speeding here.

Second, according to the data I found regarding speed limits in Croatia, you can't just ""step on it"" ""without any serious problem"". I'd say that law enforcement anywhere would have serious issues with you trying to break the speed limit by almost a factor of 2. (81 MPH x 2), jut short of the Model S top speed.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_limits_in_Croatia

Third, where did you get 700 HP? A Model S maxes out at 532 HP.

"
"Ofc we have laws, but they are easy to stretch and believe me it's easier to get a way. Until about 100mph they won't interfere at all, after that bit of luck and you are good to go. That's part of me loves 3rd world countries...

Isn't P85/90/100D 700hp?"
"Model S values keep going up year by year.  Assuming the following are pack current values (crank hp & wheel hp will be lower due to system losses; IIRC, industry standard for electric motors is kW at motor input):

P85 ~(375kW=500hp) @ ""max""-mode 95%SoC

P85D ~(415kW=555cell-hp; ""463""(CHP?)) @ ""max""-mode 90%SoC.

P85DL (450-460kW=600-615hp ""max""-mode; ""532""(CHP?))@90-100% SoC.

'15 P90D was hitting 450+kW(600+ hp) & 460+kW(615+ ""max""-mode hp) @""90%"" charge, up to ~470kw(630hp)[>90% charge + ""max"" mode].

'16 hitting up to ~480kW(645hp) & ~510kW(""max""-mode 685hp) at >=90%SOC from cell. 

See P85, P85D, P85DL, P90D('15), P90DL('15), P90D('16) ""Max Batt""|""Max Batt Power"" [kW:SOC] graphs.

(https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/max-power-vs-state-of-charge-and-temp.59444/page-6)

P85DL was advertised at 532hp, so that's 532hp(CHP?)/600-615(pack output non-thermal kwh=HP) which would be ostensible 17%(463chp/550packHP) to 11%(532chp/600packHP) loss from cell->crank + 10% loss from crank to WHP (415whp/463chp)(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RESgO9zuTDk)*Note this possibly over-rating drivetrain loss as the linked chart might be prior to ""max""-battery feature rollout.  

If that assumption is correct and scaling holds, the '16 P90DL would maybe would have been advertised as  570-600hp CHP (@17-12% packHP-to-chp loss & 510-540WHP w/ 10% CHP-WHP drivetrain loss).  But would have acceleration performance (after initial traction limited point) comparable to an AWD ICE of ~700(510 Tesla WHP low approx. ICE drivetrain losses) to ~900(540 Tesla WHP high approx. ICE drivetrain losses) CHP (hypothetical 10-13% loss from peak for gearing constrained average accelerating CHP - 20-30% loss from AWD drivetrain) or RWD ICE of 666CHP to 750CHP (10%-13% peak drop avg HP + 15%-17% drivetrain loss using same estimation as AWD example above).

Direct hp #s comparison is also heavily skewed against EV because peak CHP is avg. HP, whereas avg. HP for ICE in gear (what really determines perf.) of an ICE car is down significant percentage (the advertised crank-hp is only momentary) under accel., and a Tesla AWD drivetrain loss is *way* less than that of an AWD ICE car.  ICE vendors (esp. germans and particularly in case of turbo vehicles will massively lowball their CHP numbers as well which makes performance comparisons suspect/confounded.)  This is likely the reason for Tesla not bothering to advertise HP any longer and focuson on specific perf. e.g. (0-60mph, 35-65mph)"
"> Isn't P85/90/100D 700hp?

Not according to Google, or [the 'Specifications' section of the Model S Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S#Specifications).

As far as whether or not you'd be prosecuted for speeding in Croatia, that's on you, but I wouldn't want to speed like that on a public road and endanger others (that's what tracks are for), nor would I want to risk damaging or destroying my vehicle.

**EDIT**: /u/Esperiel linked a TMC post that suggests that 700+ horsepower is possible, though it is *not* the default, it is *not* available at all times (the battery must heat up first), and it also trades off range."
"I see. Thanks, post edited."
"Dunno but max power for D is rated near or over 700hp depending on model 85/90/100

"As FiatChysler and Ford move their production to Mexico... GM builds many of their vehicles in Canada (no, I'm sorry. Please stop!) The most exciting thing to happen to American manufacturing gets bullied, by ""free market"" republicans. 

"
"Michigan's corruption in the auto industry is embarrassing... With protectionist actions like this happening all over the wealthiest country in the world, it's readily apparent that civilized humans are not nearly as intelligent as we like to give ourselves credit for. Not in action, anyway. We are capable of amazing thoughts, but given the asinine nature of most of our *actions*...

I truly hope Elon Musk's type of person becomes more commonplace. People who put those useful thoughts regarding how things could be done into action, rather than falling back upon whatever is best for the bottom line, and what is best for stifling or killing competition."
Follow the money my friends. Follow the money.
"Snyder really is a top notch human being isn't he? From the whole lead crisis, to the banning of straight forward free market products he's really helping the people of Michigan live their lives without interference. "
"They must have drafted this back in August.

> For example, unlike traditional car dealerships, Tesla sells its cars at uniform and transparent  prices based on the configuration and options that a customer selects for the vehicle. Thus, at Tesla, customers will never be rushed into a purchase, haggle over the price of the car, wonder if they could get a better deal...
"
"As a citizen of Michigan I must say, good for Tesla. We're supposed to be the motor capital of the world, and here we are - unable to allow one of the most innovative automobile companies to participate in our state because of legacy bureaucracy. Despite this I still see a fair amount of Tesla cars on our roads, people want them! Our engineers want to work on them too!

We can be frank, the dealership law only exists because they've been flexing on our leadership for so long. There's no sensible reason a company shouldn't be allowed to sell its own products. Apple does it, Burger king does it, the local farmer down the street does it... 

Our state might lose it's place in the automotive arena if we don't shape up and get with the program. These new business models are coming whether we like it or not, and fighting back is only going to cause us to be left behind.

I've seen this pop up a few times over the last few years and each time the state has dug its heels in and resisted change. Truly despicable."

"I'm not a lawyer, so here goes.

If the feds are in charge of inter-state trade, couldn't Tesla sue the feds?  Suing all the states that don't allow direct sales seems prohibitively expensive and could yield very inconsistent rulings.  By going direct to the fed, Tesla could lay the groundwork for all makers to have a direct sale model."
"Good, hopefully it teaches these assholes that it will catch up with them and sets precedent."
Why isn't Snyder in prison?
"Just as FYI as a MI Telsa owner, whenever I have needed service, Tesla sends someone up to me to fix whatever needs it. It would be nice to have a service center though for any big repairs. I can't wait to see how this goes."
"Next, potential customers should open a similar class action suite. "
This is the way to go. Corruption is so thick in the air you can cut it with a knife. Shameless governor
"Isn't that unconstitutional?? States can't interfere with interstate commerce or something , right?"
"Hell yes, sue his pants off!"
Honestly I don't understand why the auto-makers are against direct sales themselves? Wouldn't they also benefit from it by cutting out the mark-up added by their dealers?
This is so infuriating. I got a Model 3 reserved and I don't want to drive 8 hours to Cleveland or Chicago every time I want to get my car serviced! This is complete BS.
"It's about time.  The dealer laws blocking Tesla are anti-trust, anti-competitive, and probably violate other federal laws.   Until now, no one has ever challenged them.  It's time to move into the future of automobile sales.

Just like the first patent for the automobile used against Ford was found to apply only to diesel-engined cars, I believe the Michigan laws only apply to motors that burn a fuel, and not EVs.  Why?  Because that's my argument."
Please New Mexico next.. I want my tesla
"It sounds like they've picked their case to escalate up towards the Supreme Court. Have talked for awhile how they want to challenge the rights of states to restrict interstate commerce but you want to find the right situation to fight.

Considering they are restricting the ability to even service their products, this may be a good one.

From my understanding, if they can win a case federally saying these laws are unconstitutional and get it upheld through appeals it will negate all state laws."
"Maybe I missed something or have a lack of knowledge about the American legal system but, where is the legal justification for this ban? Under what law can they issue this ban?"
I had plans to buy both a Tesla and a Chevy bolt .... I didn't know GM did that. As a Canadian I can't do much to help but I'll vote with my wallet up here and cancel my planned GM purchase and award it to Tesla instead.

" What I don't get is that, being able to sell directly to the public is a much bigger benefit to the big 3 than the benefits they get out of holding up Tesla. Tesla is selling cars either way.  Preventing a few Tesla sales is small potatoes.

"I'm against the ban, but... the lawsuit reads more like a P.R. document than a legal document. Lots of ""we make lots of cars in America! Accelerate the advent of sustainable energy!

I kinda get the equal protection argument (dealers are allowed to sell GM cars, but Tesla isn't allowed to sell Tesla cars) but what does the due process clause have to do with this?

Any lawyers around who can make sense of this suit and how far it is likely to go?"
Can someone ELI5 the reason for selling vehicles through 3rd party dealerships? 
The whole dealership business model does not apply to this day and age. Its too bad it is now a crutch to reduce competition.

including memorable 'baker' analogy by r/lazychef (https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/4h9wpi/eli5_why_are_states_banning_direct_sales/d2oqghs)

Earlier Connecticut brouhaha (lots of interesting discussion points): https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/4h5zjz/followup_tesla_direct_sales_bill_fails_in/

I also tried to parse the contract legalese (WRT rationale/impact/pressures) (https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/4h5zjz/followup_tesla_direct_sales_bill_fails_in/d2nzvzt) including a brief [restraining-order / child-support] analogy WRT to existing car manufacturer franchise laws.

Aside: in a way the, the franchise laws were put in place to protect from repeated franchisor abuses of its own franchisees (including franchisor workarounds); Tesla having no franchisees would be logically exempt.  The contentious issue was akin to a last minute word change that turned the law from protecting franchisees to a blanket banning of non-franchise sales with alleged (hardly coincidental) targeting of Tesla and any perhaps upcoming non-franchise car vendors."

> There are over 400 Tesla owners in Michigan and they have to travel to neighboring states to have their vehicle serviced. GM, who Tesla said lobbied for the ban in Michigan, even boasted about the fact that Tesla owners have difficulty getting service.

That's one thing I see a lot of people get wrong, obviously even GM. In my case, service has been extremely convenient. When I had a hardware issue or wanted to schedule annual service, I called my service center in Cleveland or they called me, a ranger came to my work or home to swap my car with a loaner, then 2-11 days later I got my car back. My car has had service six times in the two years I've had it, mostly for minor issues they insisted on fixing then rather than waiting for the annual, and one of them was done by a ranger in the parking lot at work. I haven't paid a single penny for service apart from the $1900 for four years annual service.

I've also had a couple software issues and all that took was a call or email to Tesla Support and those issues were resolved remotely. Though, admittedly, it took about three emails to get them to find and fix one of them which was on their end: My car was somehow marked as not delivered in their system, preventing me from receiving OTA updates starting about 7 months after delivery.

So, given the situation in Michigan, Tesla has handled it spectacularly. I imagine far better than any dealer would dare."

"The federal government isn't preventing Tesla from doing anything. This is a state that is preventing Tesla from selling products within the state, so it is out of the jurisdiction of the federal government. "
they would have a hell of an existing fight on their hands. It's different for tesla who has never had dealers or dealers to rely on them. Every little extra thing would be scrutinized like how dealers do.
"That's the whole reason this debate is even a thing. Originally they didn't want to deal with direct sales as they didn't have the money to setup a store in every town so they made deals with Dealers to sell the cars for them. If the manufactures, after making tons of money from the dealers work, then went to direct sales they would kill the dealers business. That's why they have provisions in their contracts about this and its been lobbied into law everywhere.

The automakers would probably love to use their now massive wallets to sell directly and undercut their competition (the dealers). Tesla never had these contracts with dealers in the first place so their claim is the laws don't apply to them. Snyder apparently disagrees."
"They're not against direct sales, plenty of manufacturers would love to sell directly.

GM has consistently been against the laws Tesla pushes which allow Tesla *and only Tesla* to sell directly, while upholding/reinforcing the direct sales bans on the other automakers."
[deleted]
"I have a feeling that Tesla will find a way to prevent it from getting *that* bad. It'll certainly get worse than it is now once Model 3 hits in full force, likely in the form of longer wait times (which I doubt would be eliminated by driving to the service center), but Tesla could theoretically just increase their service center capacity at the border and add a bunch of car carriers, flatbeds, and rangers to handle increased demand. It's hard to say how far Tesla would go to work around the backwards legislation to support their customers and I hope we don't have to find out."
"Actually the laws are more pro-trust, which is the problem.  It can marginally be argued that the dealer network runs afoul of antitrust laws."
"The only indications GM has had any influence besides a public statement of support are statement from Tesla.  I'm personally skeptical, for obvious reasons."
"No idea why this is being downvoted.  One of my relatives worked for GM until just very recently and is thinking about buying a Bolt as soon as possible, then turn around and sell it after 90 days (condition of voucher) with under 1000 miles, probably for about the same he will pay for it, in order to monetize a $35000 new car voucher that was part of a retirement package.  He then wants to put that money toward a Tesla."
"I dropped this in another thread. It's controversial, but it deserves to be mentioned. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy"
"I think it is a legitimate case and will be long and drawn out, but that if Tesla can take down Michigan, then smaller states will follow suit and get rid of their dealership protectionist laws. There will be precedence set with this case, which will make following lawsuits trivial to decide for the courts."
"Why do you believe that?

I believe this is a very serious effort and Tesla will eventually prevail.
"
"If Tesla is successful in getting people to buy more electric cars (I'd argue they're winning and as long as they are still around for a while they'll succeed for certain) the market will need additional manufacturers. It's not like GM will go away if this law gets overturned. A long-term outcome is likely that you'll continue to make cars just not with gas engines. Fast, quiet cars that require less of your dollars for maintenance. "
Because Tesla claims GM is doing something with no evidence to support it?
"It isn't the Big 3 lobbying to keep direct sales out, it's the auto dealer's association."
"They'd love to, GM and Ford even tried to in the past, but dealership lobbying won out in the end and brought the current laws about."
"In theory yes but you underestimate how unwilling large corporations are to change.  Good example is Intel.  They are a high tech company that you would think would not fall into this trap but they did.  Instead of jumping on the cellphone / tablet CPU bandwagon they just keep making better and better server chips.  They are so much better that people actually buy less server chips then they did before because they can setup virtual machines and divide up the power of server chips into several server virtual machines.  In turn buying less server chips.

So with less server chip sells and virtually no cellphone / tablet cpu sells Intel is laying off workers and closing fabs."
"As someone who lives in Ontario and crosses the border with the states often, your proposal of the Windsor store to service Detroit area Tesla customers will have some bumps in the road.
Do you purchase and plate it in Ontario or have it shipped back to Detroit?  Taxes on the sale? Extra costs to deal with the ""NAFTA"" border?
Just some stuff that may creep into the transaction. ....
"
">  I kinda get the equal protection argument (dealers are allowed to sell GM cars, but Tesla isn't allowed to sell Tesla cars) 

The big difference is GM dealers are independently-owned, as required by law.  Tesla stores are owned by Tesla.  An independent Tesla dealership would have no issues, but Tesla doesn't allow independent franchises.

>but what does the due process clause have to do with this?

Denial of property (a Tesla) without due process?  That's the only thing I can think of.

"It'll be interesting to see whether the automakers get involved in this or if they leave it up to the dealerships.

If the automakers do get involved it could be bad.  Nearly everyone in Michigan either works for the auto industry or has immediate family members or close friends who do.  It will be difficult to get a jury with absolutely no auto industry connections.  The ""Buy American"" sentiment is high here as well, but what everyone really means by that is ""Buy from Ford, GM, or Chrysler""."

"Well, much of the lawsuit actually reads like PR rather than legal arguments.  Maybe that's typical- I obviously don't read a lot of this type of stuff.  

In my opinion, they also have a weak argument for why they *can't* use the dealer model for selling cars as opposed to why they don't *want* to use it.  "
"They did the same lobbying in Indiana. That one didn't succeed but I wrote to GM's CEO and got this response. This is just the relevant part: 

Thank you for contacting Mary Barra regarding the direct sales issue in Indiana.  We appreciate your candid perspective.
 
GM  is concerned over the uneven playing field which is created when different competitors in the market selling the same products are allowed to operate under completely different requirements than all others.  Tesla could operate and compete like every other automaker utilizing the franchise system, which current law in 50-states requires.  Instead, they choose to use legislation, loopholes and litigation to provide themselves with special status.
 
GM is pleased that in Indiana we were able to elevate the issue of disparity, that this received as much attention as it did, and that it has advanced as far as it has.

I've worked with someone who worked for GM and they told me they hate the dealers. Hopefully that's a fairly widespread sentiment within the workforce and the manufacturers only show support for dealers to keep those critical relations good.
"Random citizens are selected to report for jury duty and form the jury pool.  These citizens are usually chosen from voter registration lists.  The pool has an excess of people in it, and firstly they remove anybody who might have some legitimate reason to not be in the jury (for example, michigan law makes an exception for nursing mothers).  Then, the lawyers for each side are allowed to ask pool members questions to help determine if there are biases one way or another and they work with the court to determine who will ultimately serve on the jury.

So the jury is picked by the lawyers from both sides and the court itself."

Anyone looking g at the numbers statically are fools. Tesla is making 4 cars so far. Plus power units. And now solar, and a charging distribution system, and service infrastructure. Then they build software, and electronics.

Think about all these moving pieces, the gigafactory. 

It's a lot of capital upfront. Then when they sell the product it's going to take thousands of units to recoup the initial expense, if they stand still. But they are not standing still, now they have additional products in the works.

It's a long term play. Unfortunately they had to go IPO to raise capital and now burdened with wall Street conservative nature.

"That is a dumb question :P 

No, in the US the power to write laws is always held by an elected legislature. However, Governors do have the power to veto laws and if the executive branch doesn't enforce a given law then the law might as well not exist. Tesla is suing these people to get a court to impose a moratorium on the executive branch enforcing the intended actions of the legislative branch. If a court does this, then the Michigan law is defacto struck down by the court. 

In reality, if the court agrees with Tesla then the Michigan executive branch will have to decide between accepting the court's decision, escalating the argument to a higher court, or the Michigan legislative branch will have to rewrite the law in some way that complies with the court's decision. "

"1. Without being (overly) disrespectful, I think it's pretty naive to assume that the public statement was not accompanied by lobbying.

2. Not just Tesla - any EV manufacturer:

    CRITERIA A MOTOR VEHICLE MANUFACTURER MUST MEET TO SELL DIRECTLY TO CONNECTICUT RESIDENTS

    To qualify for a new or used car dealer's license under the bill, a licensed manufacturer:

    1. cannot have a franchise agreement with a new car dealer in Connecticut; [*MY NOTE: This excludes GM without even moving on to #2*]

    2. must manufacture only electric vehicles and sell at retail only vehicles it makes;

    3. cannot hold a controlling interest in another manufacturer or a subsidiary, affiliate, or entity owned or controlled by another manufacturer, licensed as a dealer under the bill; and

    4. cannot be owned or controlled by another manufacturer or a subsidiary, affiliate, or entity owned or controlled by another manufacturer, licensed as a dealer under the bill.

    The bill exempts a manufacturer who meets these qualifications from motor vehicle franchise laws (see BACKGROUND). One law from which it exempts a manufacturer licensed as a dealer under the bill assigns priority order of dealer ownership rights in cases where such ownership rights conflict.

    Under the bill, a manufacturer is any person, firm, or corporation licensed as a motor vehicle manufacturer under state law and any subsidiary, affiliate, or entity it owns or controls. The bill expands the statutory definitions of new and used car dealers to include such a manufacturer and generally subjects the manufacturer to the rules governing these dealers. Under the bill, if a manufacturer is licensed as a new car dealer, it may also repair vehicles and sell used vehicles; if licensed as a used car dealer, it may also repair vehicles."
There are countless government regulations that business don't want to deal with that they legally have to.
"How is it an advantage? If GM wanted, they could also sell direct just as Tesla would be doing. "
A bill passed if I remember that would allow Tesla to direct sell and he vetoed it.  Which signals to me that the legislature doesn't mind the idea.

"> That's literally what lobbying is.

Lobbying to me generally involves something besides a public corporate statement in support of a bill.  So you'd agree Tesla is lobbying to sell directly and block their competitors from doing so?

> Which makes sense, it would be a lot harder to push a law allowing every manufacturer to sell directly. They already aren't allowed to, so it's not a matter of Tesla trying to block them. If they want to try and pass their own direct sales bills I'm sure Tesla would be perfectly fine with that.

Tesla is already not allowed to as well in most of these states since the laws state that manufacturers have to sell through dealerships.  And it's interesting that when Tesla actually influences congressmembers to write laws a certain way that benefit them at the expense of competition, it's written off as Tesla just trying to ensure they can sell cars, but if GM so much as releases a statement advocating for equal laws for all manufacturers, they're going after Tesla."
The comment is calling GM disgusting for (supposedly) lobbying for the ban and then commenting on serviceability (for lack of a better term) of the Bolt.  
">Direct sales with dealer ties are already disallowed by contract

Then why does NADA care about the law?

Depends hugely on the dealership.

It opens the door for them to have a competitive advantage. "
"> Without being (overly) disrespectful, I think it's pretty naive to assume that the public statement was not accompanied by lobbying.

Oh absolutely.  I have no doubt GM is pressuring lawmakers every time this comes up, but that doesn't change the fact that there's no evidence as to whether GM is lobbying or how hard they're lobbying.  And frankly, I think it would be equally naive to take Tesla's statements (such as GM ""authoring"" an ""anti-Tesla"" bill) at face value when there's no supporting evidence.

> Not just Tesla - any EV manufacturer:

Not any EV manufacturer, any EV manufacturer who doesn't have any franchise agreements, sells at ""retail"", doesn't have a stake in another automaker, or have a stake in the company held by another automaker.  GM could start cranking out nothing but EVs tomorrow and cut ties with every dealership that doesn't hold the standards of Tesla stores and would still be excluded.  Just to give you an idea of how ridiculous this is, Tesla could have arguably been excluded as well two years ago because of the stake Daimler held.

This is a law that effectively allows Tesla and only Tesla to sell directly."
"They can't, the law specifically allows only Tesla to sell directly.  GM and every other big automaker is still banned."
"Or they knew he would veto and didn't want to look bad themselves. This is politics we're talking about, after all."

"> So you'd agree Tesla is lobbying to sell directly

Yes

No

How is it at the expense of their competition? Like I said, their competition is fully able to try and push their own bills allowing them to sell directly as well. If GM or any other company wanted to do that and lobbied for it I'm pretty sure most everyone here would be supportive about it, I know I would."

That's almost exactly what GM said. They're stuck with an inferior sales model and don't want anyone to be able to sell under a better model that they wish they could have."
"> Oh absolutely. I have no doubt GM is pressuring lawmakers every time this comes up

Right, but you understand that this is what lobbying *is*, right?

>  And frankly, I think it would be equally naive to take Tesla's statements (such as GM ""authoring"" an ""anti-Tesla"" bill) at face value when there's no supporting evidence.

> This is a law that effectively allows Tesla and only Tesla to sell directly.

No, it doesn't.  It wouldn't stop Faraday Future.  It wouldn't stop Fisker.  It wouldn't stop Apple, assuming they are actually making one.  It wouldn't stop Myers Motors."
"This is not correct. The law was adjusted from (paraphrasing for clarity) ""manufacturers can not sell direct if they have a dealer network"" to ""manufacturers must use a dealer network"". I agree with the previous version which would avoid manufacturers having too much power (I don't like you now, though you invested millions, so I'll just stop giving you cars and sell direct). But Tesla never had dealers and doesn't see it as an effective business model. Let the consumers decide - no existing business is being hurt. Should it prove a better model, GM could theoretically choose to buyout their dealers and sell direct.
Also - there is no ""specific"" mention of Tesla in the law.

So, in the end this is the dealer association and GM trying to stifle competition by manipulating law ... in contradiction of the concept of a free capitalistic market. If they could, I think GM might actually enjoy a relaxing of the law to allow direct since it's far easier now. Dealers are not necessary any more due to significantly improved supply chains ... hell, a Tesla can soon deliver itself to the new owner!"

"So I'm guessing every poll is rigged by the Republicans too? Come on, man. You're promoting an unfounded conspiracy theory, plain and simple. "
"> How is it at the expense of their competition?

Because it reinforces the law against their competition and reinforces the precedent that established manufacturers cannot sell directly?  And it effectively grants Tesla a competitive advantage?

If you don't think that's at the expense of other manufacturers, would you also agree GM supporting dealership laws isn't at the expense of Tesla because Tesla can just sell via dealerships?  That's miles easier than trying to get an established law with large lobbyist support overturned.

>If GM or any other company wanted to do that and lobbied for it I'm pretty sure most everyone here would be supportive about it, I know I would.

I think you're underestimating the raw hatred a lot of people here have for GM.

They're stuck with an inferior model because of the law, and they think it's unfair that the law doesn't apply equally to someone else.  I'm not seeing how that's an unreasonable position."

Yes, hence why I didn't say that *I* don't think they're lobbying, just that there's no evidence.

Not you, the comment I originally replied to.

>No, it doesn't. It wouldn't stop Faraday Future. 

Assuming they ever come out with an EV, and they never put an ICE in any of their cars, and they don't take any stakes or sell any shares to other automakers, and they don't enter any agreement with any dealership franchise, then no, it wouldn't stop them.

>It wouldn't stop Fisker. 

Yes it would, they have franchise agreements.  

>It wouldn't stop Apple, assuming they are actually making one. 

If the deals they're going for [with other automakers](http://jalopnik.com/apples-car-project-is-in-complete-disarray-as-it-talks-1786939720) go through, it would.

>It wouldn't stop Myers Motors.

They also are going for franchise agreements, so it would also stop them.

If you go with a hypothetical company almost identical to Tesla that actually puts out a product and follows most of the same steps as Tesla, then no, the law wouldn't stop them.  But like I said, *effectively*, it's an exemption for Tesla and only Tesla."

Wait...how do you figure?  If it were changing quickly, we'd likely be seeing much more widespread adoption of EVs.  What we have instead is a bunch of (admittedly anecdotal) stories about people going to dealerships to look for that brand's token EV compliance car, and not being given much help and being pressured to look at their higher-profit-because-of-service ICE cars instead.

If you mean the fact that the Bolt is coming out, I hope it gets better, but I'm not optimistic about it."

We're running in circles on that point...

> They're stuck with an inferior model because of the law, and they think it's unfair that the law doesn't apply equally to someone else. I'm not seeing how that's an unreasonable position.

The law as it exists in several states is overreaching. There is no good reason to ban manufacturers from selling directly if they don't have, or especially never had, a contract with a dealer that prevents it. It's anti-competitive, anti-free market, and anti-progress. They need to find a way to adapt their businesses without laws forcing everyone to do business their way, just like nearly every other country in the world."
"Part of the reason that companies starting up go after franchise support is because they feel like they're forced to by existing laws...but I agree the structuring and wording of this (CT) one in particular is kind of pointed and crappy.

If a manufacturer has agreements with franchises, they should continue to honor them if their contract specifies that they must.  If it doesn't, or they haven't entered into any yet, they should not be forced to do so."
I guess i have a bit too much optimism for humanity at times...
"All I'm asking for is real evidence, which you've yet to provide me. Take a look at [this data](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo) for a few minutes, and explain to me how it's all made up. I'm listening. You act like Republicans are magical nonexistent unicorns or something, yet the aggregate of hundreds of polls is currently showing 46.6% of voters planning on voting for Clinton, and 44.2% of voters planning on voting for Trump.

You can rig some polls, but you can't rig them all. Leave the city for one second and look at some yard signs, jeez."
"Well my counterpoint is anecdotal as well, but it sounds like manufacturers (especially Chevy with the Volt and Bolt) are cracking down on dealerships that pull shit like that.  Add in the threat of manufacturers potentially be able to just sell anything dealerships won't sell direct to consumer, and there's some pretty big incentives to sell everything fairly.

Also keep in mind that especially here, you're never going to hear those stories about the people who walked in to look at a Volt and had a knowledgeable salesperson who was happy to sell it to them."
"> There is no good reason to ban manufacturers from selling directly if they don't have, or especially never had, a contract with a dealer that prevents it. 

But there's a good reason to ban manufacturers from selling directly solely because they have franchise dealerships?

>It's anti-competitive, anti-free market, and anti-progress. 

But allowing one company to sell directly and banning its competitors from doing so isn't?

>They need to find a way to adapt their businesses without laws forcing everyone to do business their way, just like nearly every other country in the world.

And as I've said many times here, I absolutely agree.  But I cannot support a law that would create two separate sets of rules for automakers.  Everyone plays by the same rules, whatever those may be."
"> Part of the reason that companies starting up go after franchise support is because they feel like they're forced to by existing laws...but I agree the structuring and wording of this (CT) one in particular is kind of pointed and crappy.

True, I don't doubt that.  My point is mostly that yes, you can come up with fringe cases and startups that might be able to squeeze under the exception, but no serious Tesla competitor will be able to.

> If a manufacturer has agreements with franchises, they should continue to honor them if their contract specifies that they must. If it doesn't, or they haven't entered into any yet, they should not be forced to do so.

I absolutely agree, but you don't have to make a law forcing a company to honor their contract.  That's what a contract is for.  If manufacturers try to break them, they'll have a *very* quick lawsuit from NADA."
"> But there's a good reason to ban manufacturers from selling directly solely because they have franchise dealerships?

It's mostly because dealers would never let it pass if that extra layer of protection was removed. The idea of keeping some restrictions in the law is to whittle them away as the vested interests adapt and allow. If you can find a better way to eliminate the law completely in one go without being shot down by the dealers, be my guest, Michigan and other states are waiting.

> But allowing one company to sell directly and banning its competitors from doing so isn't?

They got themselves into that mess, they don't need to drag other companies into it screaming and kicking with a higher probability of failure (Fisker is a good example of that). Even if Tesla were the only direct-sale car manufacturer, which I'm certain it isn't (DMC appears to sell direct alongside ""affiliated dealers""), it definitely won't stay that way if the franchise barrier to entry is removed."
"> you don't have to make a law forcing a company to honor their contract. 

Yeah, I agree with that too."

Dealers aren't ""letting"" the current laws pass, and are doing their best to shoot them down.  And your logic is because it's too difficult to do, might as well just take the easy route that offers one manufacturer a different set of rules?

>They got themselves into that mess, 

Dealership lobbying got them into that mess.

>they don't need to drag other companies into it screaming and kicking with a higher probability of failure (Fisker is a good example of that). 

Fisker's failure had nothing to do with dealerships.

>Even if Tesla were the only direct-sale car manufacturer, which I'm certain it isn't 

They're the only direct-sale manufacturer that sells production cars.

>(DMC appears to sell direct alongside ""affiliated dealers""), 

DMC doesn't do anything besides parts and replicas.

>it definitely won't stay that way if the franchise barrier to entry is removed.

Not having to pay millions of dollars for sales infrastructure isn't really a barrier to entry.  And who's going to sell direct?  Every major automaker is banned.  Fisker is banned.  With Apple's current plans, they're banned.  BYD is banned.  Myers Motors is banned.  Faraday Future might be able to squeeze in, assuming they actually bring out a product."

I doubt the direct sales investment is that much different than establishing franchise relationships. Like Tesla, it could start with online orders and shipping directly from factory to customer. I believe Tesla would have failed if they went the franchise route for the reasons Elon has mentioned repeatedly, especially the lack of interest from dealers. As I understand the law, those ""banned"" companies you list would only be banned if they had a dealer in a state with the law that they want to sell directly in. In Michigan, I only see a Fisker dealer, so none of the others would be banned as it stands if I'm looking at it right.

Anyway, I'm getting tired of this argument and, well, being awake right now. Let's see if we can at least agree on one thing core to the debate. Do you agree that it would be best if all manufacturers were legally allowed to sell directly (provided they don't violate their contracts) or would you rather the laws banning direct sales remain that way?"
">Do you agree that it would be best if all manufacturers were legally allowed to sell directly (provided they don't violate their contracts) or would you rather the laws banning direct sales remain that way?

I absolutely agree, 100%, that it would be best to have no laws whatsoever forcing manufacturers to sell a certain way.  They should be able to sell directly or not sell directly as they see fit, obviously provided they're not violating contracts.  That's something I have always stood behind.

The issue for me, as always, is Tesla pushing for laws that create a special exemption that applies to them while shutting out their competitors."
"I'm not sure of Tesla's motive beyond my previously mentioned assumptions. I admit I'm biased and don't want to think that Tesla would have anti-competitive reasons for pushing for those part-way laws.

Anyway, since we found something to agree on, I'll leave this discussion on that good note."

Assuming that Katz guy isn't too smart (which seems to be the case) he just used his personal/work PC to connect to Yahoo and send the email. This would mean that you know from what public IP the email was sent and what approximate location is connected to that IP. 

Bring out a map and yellow pages and find which companies or individuals could potentially be the source.

As soon as you have a few suspects, send them an unrelated email and see which ones respond using the same public IP address as the one used with the Yahoo account.

Or am I missing something?"

Unlikely, because this would probably just lead them to an ISP like at&t or CenturyLink, or possibly to the  questintegrity network, but only if they actually register their corporate office's internet gateway on their own domain, which would be unlikely for a company other than a Microsoft or Google.

2) Katz was so stupid, he set up the Yahoo account to forward to a personal or corporate account and then forgot to turn off an auto-reply or out of office message which made it back to Tesla.

3) Katz used an email address or phone number when registering the Yahoo account which could be traced back to him, and Tesla was able to surreptitiously discover it.

Elon Wot? Wlon Wot? 
Am I the only one reading this in his accent?
"They must have also learned, via the internet machine, how to properly form a sentence and imitation techniques.
...Evidently they learned from the *wrong* source. "
"He does capitalize very well on twitter, but is sloppy with periods at end of sentences. (I looked this up, my dyslectic brain doesn't normally care about these details.)"
They would've known for sure that there'd be no resisting after numbers like that.
"What part would be illegal? 

This isn't an official release of information that the SEC etc. would even look at. They'd just be fucking with a scammer, and people would treat it as it should, like a shitty false ""leak""."

You'll find many very wealthy people in power are very stupid. I try to ignore it.

Planters Peanuts man.
"He's too wealthy for criminal law to apply, hence the civil suit. "
Cause he's a rich oil exec?
"From the title of the OP:

Thank you. I can't stop laughing.
Go make a us a risotto.
Kimbal confirmed. 
"Pretty sure that's because he usually tweets from mobile, which takes care of capitalization."
Watt are you talking about‚ÄΩ 
It's explicitely illegal to spread misinformation about a publicly traded asset. because that could be used to manipulate the markets while circumventing insider trading rules.
"nah, i have it on good authority that its elonmusk@fiskerautomotive.com"
But is the seventh chevron locked?

"Apologies. I mean a Criminal thing not simply a civil thing. 

What the person did was illegal. Computer Fraud isn't typical a crime DA's overlook.  So is this also a Criminal investigation or it a simple civil thing? "
Ohm pretty sure it's about what you'd expect.

"I did some searching and found this: https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370543021551 which seems semi-related. The only difference is in this case they were releasing press releases that were false.

In the case of the idiot scammer in the article, it's not intended for public consumption, it's not even intended to influence a market so couldn't be considered insider trading, as the scammer's not an insider and he's not getting accurate information. It's just to screw with a scammer, so could it really be considered that?

Ok, we're really over-doing this analysis now :)"
">nah, i have it on good authority that its elonmusk@fiskerautomotive.com

Are you sure it isn't fisker@teslamotors.com?"
Are you saying Bill Gates doesn't have a Windows phone?

Honest nuclear codes guess? no bs. po
"Oh, no clue there. IANAL."
Somebody is definitely gonna get charged.
"The [interrobang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang). Next you will ask me how I typed it. I would love to tell you so way that makes me sound smart, but really I copied it off the internet and created a shortcut on my iPhone keyboard so anytime I type the two it replaces it..."
You sure it wasn't ElonMusk@Mobileye.com?
"In the interest of preserving history, he should."
"Probably not, as Windows phone is EOL"
Electricity.
"Don't laugh at it, social engineering attacks like this have great potential. "
"I would love to tell you that you aren't smart, but I'm curious. How exactly do you create a shortcut like that?"

"That's pure speculation. Windows Phone itself is gone, replaced by Windows 10 for phones. Microsoft has also stopped manufacturing Lumia phones. Those are the facts, the rest is speculation that they're working on a Surface branded phone to replace their Lumia line.

Windows 10 on phones is still alive, it just got the anniversary update and is still getting weekly beta updates for insiders."
Source for that? Or do you mean replaced by Windows for Phone?
"AH, I was unaware of that, TIL"
You might even say they're kinetic in nature. 
Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Text Replacement
">still getting weekly beta updates for insiders.

Those lucky people

While they haven't explicitly stated it, the direction is clear. Services, not platforms. They have begun offering their services and applications on Android and iOS while neglecting their own mobile platform. "
"It's not, Windows Phone is gone replaced by Windows 10 on phones. It's still getting updated regularly."
The number of electricity jokes on this thread is just shocking.
"Gotcha, thanks. :)"
"It's Windows 10, literally the same kernel as the desktop/laptop OS and Xbox 1 OS. It's not dying anytime soon."
"That's fine, I'm not trying to convince people to use it, just trying to combat misinformation. 

From what I've gathered, they encourage people to use different platforms, it allows different perspectives on how to make the platform better."
They are definitely making a surface phone
"The next major update to Windows 10 is supposed to have a major focus on the mobile space, so lots of new features and whatnot that should release around spring. Windows Phone is a core aspect of that. "
Enough to leave one incapacitated.
[These two](https://imgur.com/a/8glN1) make me look like I know what I'm doing!
"> literally the same kernel

That is highly unlikely
"
"Can confirm that. Joe Belfiore who was one of the leaders of the Windows Phone team was discovered using Android phones and iPhones. They want their staff to experiment with other platforms so they can see how those users use the platform, thus bringing new features into their own"
"Yes, and it will capture 0.00001% market share! That's four times that of windows phone! How exciting!"
"[One NT Kernel for Desktop, Laptop, Tablet, Phone, Xbox, and HoloLens. Supports both x86 and ARM processors.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT) 

[Windows 10 Mobile does indeed use the NT Kernel.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10_Mobile#Development)

[Thanks to the shared Kernel, apps designed using UWP can run on all Windows 10 devices, desktops, laptops, tablets, phones, xboxs, and hololens.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Windows_Platform)"
OK but that's the opposite of the point you were trying to make 
"Shared kernel does not mean the same kernel. 

Android uses Linux, but a heavily modified version of it, it's not really the same that powers the world's servers, Azure's networking and microsoft's homepage."
Not really. I said windows phone is EOL. I said nothing about surface
"True, but this is the same. Build versions are the same, when the desktop Windows gets an update, so does the mobile. There are differences in the hardware abstraction layer for the different hardware and radios in mobile devices, but the base Kernel is the same. They are much closer than Android is to Linux."
What OS do you think Surface Phone will be running? 
Probably a modified version of windows 10
