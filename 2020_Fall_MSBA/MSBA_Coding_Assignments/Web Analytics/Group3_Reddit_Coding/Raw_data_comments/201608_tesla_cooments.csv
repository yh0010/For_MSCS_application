I'm more excited about the extended range thanks to the battery upgrade. 315 miles is very impressive. 
Has the autopilot price gone up?  It shows up as 3k.  Wasn't it 2500?
"Wait - if 2.5s is for Ludicrous mode, what will Maximum Plaid for the new two-seat Roadster be? 2s?

EDIT: Also, I like the fact that they're showing NEDC numbers now. Too many European car makers have recently tried to get away with claiming ranges as high or even higher than Tesla because they quoted NEDC ranges, while in reality, their ranges may not even match those of the Tesla cars.

And most of the press doesn't know any better either, so they just write headlines like ""BMW XXX Will Have 400-Mile Range!"""
imagine a model 3 with a 100KW battery! that thing will go 400+ miles
"Tesla has without a doubt truly revolutionized the car industry like no other manufacturer could in the past 10 years, which is quite an incredible accomplishment since they've only actually produced cars for about half that time."
Do they only offer a new P100D or will a 'normal' 100D also follow? All news and media talk about P100D
Model X 0-60s -> 2.9. In a freaking SUV!!! Wtff.
"Interested to see if they will consolidate the battery lineup again. At this point we have 60, 75, 90, and 100 kWh. "
I'm more interested about the Premium Seats from the Model X now available in the Model S.
"I've been adding info the press got on ""background only"" and through the press conference here: [Tesla claims ‘Quickest Production Car in the World’ title with new 100 kWh battery pack: 0-60 in 2.5s & 315 miles range](https://electrek.co/2016/08/23/tesla-100-kwh-battery-pack-quickest-car-ever/)"
">Tesla is also introducing the new Tesla Premium Seats, originally available in the Model X, to the Model S, but only for the P90D and P100D.

Yas!"
"Tesla appears to not be comfortable with proving ""yeah, it's quick"" and moving along quickly to high volume production alone. I loved the comment during the Model 3 reveal, something along the lines of ""Speed is in our DNA. We don't build slow cars."""
"Oh my shit that acceleration sounds quite literally jaw and other bones breaking. 

This kills the ICE."

Yes. What they mean by production is that it's not a limited run car. The fact that you're comparing a full size electric sedan to exotic cars is a testament. 
"~~What are the asterisks?~~

Edit: One foot rollout. Got it."
So will an existing P90D go one to sixty in 2.5 with a simple battery upgrade?
"I'm happy with my 60S 210 mile range.  It's not worth skipping a supercharger stop for another $70k.  I hope people buy them though I want Tesla to dominate, and I want more people to be able to skip superchargers so there is more room for me!"
"lol, a family sedan with a 2.5s 0-60 time. :D"
"You realize that this increase puts the 100D in at a 343 mile range?! That's amazing. 
I wonder if the plan is to call the P100D the first 300 mile BEV, then 
squeeze enough out to be able to claim the first 350 mile BEV in the 100D a few months later."
[P100D](https://www.tesla.com/tesla_theme/assets/img/vehicle-badges/p100d.svg) - It's ALIIIIVE
100kph is what is used in other countries which is ~ 62mph
"It's interesting to see that the difference between the model S and X is only a thousand dollars, I would have guessed way more for the X"
"This car will accelerate faster at higher altitudes, something that gasoline powred cars couldn't do"
I imagine they will require you to pass astronaut tests before allowing you to use that function!
"Wait, this dosnt make sense. 0-60 in 2.5 but 0-100 in 2.7? How? Also, the Porsche 918 has been able to do 0-60 in 2.2 seconds.

"
"Wow - starts at $134,500.  Spec'd out this will probably easily break $150k.  I thought I'd be a little sad when this came out with my P90D (non L) but I feel pretty good.  2.5sec is going to be mind blowing to those that experience it.

I am definitely bummed about this though.

>Tesla is also introducing the new Tesla Premium Seats, originally available in the Model X, to the Model S, but only for the P90D and P100D."
"As a future Model 3 buyer who recently paid for a preorder, I'm incredibly pleased with the transparency and honesty with the reasons for the more expensive models. Understanding that the premium choices allow the 3 to exist encourages trust in the consumer, I feel. Well done. "
"This is why I scoff when people complain about the price of Tesla cars. Like, you're getting what's very arguably THE best car in the world, in terms of safety and performance.  And you want it for the price of a Fiesta? Forget the fact that it's electric, the engineering that goes into these vehicles makes me surprised that they cost as little as they do! "
"As a guy over 40 I'm not that impressed with cars, but after being driven from Niagara Falls to Toronto in a blizzard going 100 km/hr I have never been that impressed with a car. I am going to drive my current car to the ground and hope to get a lower priced one in the few years,"
"I'd like to know when I can get the P100D (non-ludicrous) version. I have a P90D that I'm supposed to take delivery of in late November/December. I want the extra 10kWh but I don't really want/need the extra acceleration. 

Also, I'm pretty excited for the Model X seats being made available for Model X. I hope they mean they're the ventilated ones."
"I wonder where they're getting 315 miles of range from in the P100D. The P90D has 270 miles of range, or 3 miles/kWh. For 100kWh it should be 300 miles of range. At 315 miles of range the P100D is 5% more efficient than the P90D.

If the upcoming 100D is also 5% more efficient than the current 90D, that car would get somewhere around 343 miles of range."
Design studio up and running :)
maximum plaid is going to be mega stupidity
"> Existing P90D Ludicrous owners can also upgrade to a 100 kWh pack, but for $20,000, as their used 90 kWh pack will have to be recycled.

At first I thought that meant they were saying it costs $10,000 to recycle a battery. But I think what it actually means is that you can't just return your used battery and expect a 100% refund on it as if you never used it. Swapping out a battery in an as-yet undelivered battery  means you don't pay for the old battery. Swapping out a _used_ battery means you do have to pay for (at least some) of your old battery."
Is the [design studio](https://www.tesla.com/models/design) a bit fucked up for anyone else right now?
But how fast will it do around the Top Gear Test Track? The answer we'll never know...
"This sounds kinda neat but I'm going to withhold any judgment until Bob Lutz tells me what I should think about it.  

/s"
"Ok I like Tesla as much as the next guy, but it's disingenuous to call it the fastest car in the headline and the third fastest in the article.

Also, how many times can you launch a model S before it goes into limp mode? Because they did it 50 times in a row with a turbo s, which does it in ""just"" 2.7 seconds."
"So this has me considering selling my P85, waiting for AP 2.0 and picking this up.

The upgrade finally seems worth it now.

0 - 60 in 2.5 seconds. Good god. 

Edited for numbers."
"315 miles x 312 Wh/mi = 98.28kWh usable

vs

270 miles x 312 Wh/mi = 84.24kWh usable."
"Those 0-100 times can't be right. 0-60 in 2.5 but only .2 more seconds to get from 60-100?

Maybe that was 0-60mph and 0-100kph times?"
"~~Design Studio appears to be live!~~ Ultra-white seats confirmed!

Edit: They are still working on it."
"not sure advertising (or combining in this topic) the 0-60 and range in the same sentence is a good idea. if someone were to full throttle their P100D for however long, they're probably looking at 100 mi or less, much less range than 315 mi."
"sry im new here and have no knowledge about cars or tesla.  
the model X and model S alraedy existed right? so they just announced upgrades? so you have to buy the newer version if you already have the model S and wants to upgrade it? "
So still can't go to Vegas 
"does it accelerate that quickly with 7 people in it?

also holy fuck, 135k to START"
"[deleted]  
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9738 
 > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/42569)"
Just got my car two months ago and ready to upgrade. That range is so amazing. All I need to know is when the AP2 hardware will roll into production vehicles and I'm ready to buy again. 
"A 911 turbo doeee  Still, a Tesla would be a sweet second car"
"I want to buy an X so badly. Maybe in a few years when the price comes down more. Although, by that point, Musk may have invented something even better and I will be getting cast-off X's."
I don't know if the Bugatti Chiron is considered a production car (500 will be built) but it can do 0-60 in 2.4s.
[deleted]
"I'm a petrol head. I love what these Teslas offer, but I just can't get past the sound and feeling of noisy petrol engines with lots of torque twist and the likes. 

Fans of vehicles like Tesla and the better future it could bring with it, I'm sorry so many people like me keep holding it back. "
THIS IS THE GREATEST FUCKING COMPANY IN THE WORLD
"I'm so sad

I told my dad about this car 3 minutes after it was official and he's like ""315 isn't enough, who needs 2.8 second acceleration if you run out before you get where you're going"" which was really weird considering his previous thoughts on the car. I know he said the number wrong.

He has a 10 mile commute Monday to Friday but once a week he has to travel about 350 miles across the country in a single day and back the next and he doesn't stop. I would be wasting my time telling him he could take a break in the middle and be refreshed and get there. Hell, he could do that in a Model S 60. You still have to be really stupid to run out in an EV, and drive without ever checking your range, and ignoring warnings. 

He isn't usually a skeptic. I must get him to test drive one when the P100DL gets to Britain."
"Umm, several production cars have gone 2.5, the 918 clocked 2.2...

Edit: The Tesla also clocked 2.5 with a one foot rollouts which significantly reduces the time, in some cases by as much as .5 seconds."
"I might just need to cancel my Model 3 reservation. I need PLAID speed!

Side note: Is Tesla going to offer the 100kWh battery as an upgrade for 70kWh or 85kWh owners?"
"It will be interesting to see, if the improved cooling helps the performance on racetracks and pikes peak. As I understand it now the limiting factor is overheating."
"For reference here's some acceleration data for the Porsche 918 which is considered to be the quickest hypercar:

0-30 mph 1.0 seconds

0-60 mph 2.2 seconds

0-100 mph 4.9 seconds

0-130 mph 6.7 seconds

0-150 mph 10.5 seconds

"
"Pretty disappointed that they used a ""predicted time"" and couldn't wait for a real benchmark.

But, it's not a huge jump from the P90DL so I believe it.  2.5 fucking hell."
Ludicruous mode -- is that a callout to Spaceballs?  Awesome!

> The Porsche 918 Spyder is a mid-engined plug-in hybrid sports car by Porsche.

From Wikipedia on La Ferarri:

> LaFerrari (project name, F150)[4] is a limited production hybrid sports car built by Italian sports car maker Ferrari.

And Tesla is fully electric.

If you want to build the fastest accelerating car in the world then you need to go electric. Case closed.
"
"It's the quickest production car in the world for 0 - 60 mph! Well only if you not count the other two...

Right.

Edit: Throw the Veyron Super Sport into the mix, it reportedly does 0 - 100 km/h in 2.46 seconds. ( 0 - 62.1371 mph)
"
"Has it completed the 'Ring yet?

Lol at the number of people confused about 100km/h thinking it's mph, shows how much you guys know about cars :P"

"Fastest accelerating from 0-60...what about beyond that?  These cars fall on their face after that.

How many G's of force is 0-60 in 2.5 seconds? 
"ICE, lol."
"The P90D looks to have lost the ability to go Ludicrous, but the price increased $5500. 

Any reason why? I see that the seats are now upgraded to the next gen versions on the base option, but there's still a $2500 cost to upgrade to leather. "
"I wonder how many kWh the Roadster will be. I imagine that even with 100 kWh it will be insanely fast, probably around 0-60 in 2.2 or 2.3 seconds. But I bet Elon will try to put 120 kWh battery into the Roadster and get it to go 0-60 in 2 seconds or less. "
"Its on BBC too:
http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37171455"
Did the smaller pack versions decrease in price?
"Sure, 0-60 i.e."
"Was asking a local sales rep about this today, she almost nailed every single aspect of what Tesla said, it being almost 300 mile range and it being avalible on both models for a 10000 upgrade, maybe she got the news first!"
how do I buy just a battery pack?
"I wonder if acceleration rate increase is actually due to a larger battery pack itself or just a completely different, separate tech improvement introduced at the same time.

I.e. with an ICE vehicle you don't expect it to accelerate faster if you increase the tank volume (would be a neat trick!). With an electric though, could this be due to current being drawn in parallel from more available cells, thus getting more effective wattage to the engines?"
200Kwh for the Anniversary edition! 
so it's safe to assume that the model 3 will also get a bump in performance....Oh Yeah!
I'm still waiting on a wagon or mid-size SUV with a decent range and not 100 grand price tag.
"To put things into scale, the Model X's 100 KWh battery has similar capacity to 100,000 double a batteries."
"If 2.5 seconds is still too slow for you, remember that in the past, owner and independent tests have often yielded even better acceleration times. Maybe 2.3 or 2.4?

P90DL was announced with 2.8 and tested with 2.6."
But the Lamborghini Huracan does 0-60 in 2.5 seconds as well.

That's really amazing! For comparison the Ferrari Laferrari can go approximately 363 miles on a single tank of gas. 
"Of all the cool things about Tesla it's these battery milestones that are the big things for me. If you ask me this milestone should have a bigger event.

Since 2009 I've loved Tesla for the meaning of the drivable range. I had also NO idea that superchargers could be rolled out this way. Actually I still thing plugging in should cost 1USD/Euro to give Tesla more cashflow. 

If they started out putting 85Kwh in a Volvo 240 I'd still be interested. :D All the other stuff is just a massive bonus for me they day I hope to buy a used 85."
"Wow, as much as I love the handmade supercars, this is even more impressive of an achievement.  Almost seemed like an impossible feat, and 40 years ago, I don't think anyone would have disagreed with that statement."
Am I the only one who wants to know what the performance/range of the first sub 25k$ Tesla is going to be?

"eh the huracan will beat that to 100 and pull away really fast after that, and I'd be surprised if the 911TT couldnt do it in real world conditions too

not taking away from the tesla but lets get real here, regardless it will be amazing to see what sports car manufacturers come out with using electric technology"
"Ludacris speed,  I think they have gone plaid."
"All shut up, now just save money for it."
Does this mean that a regular 100kw battery for the Model X is not yet available?
"P100D’s consumption is estimated at 98 MPGe which is also better than the companies P90D’s 95 MPGe. Looking at this Tesla is breaking records inside the house as well as outside, nice job for them. That has to be one of the reasons for their success, that and the fact that they don’t take anything as good enough, they make everything even better.

Im just spitballing here and I don't know if the batteries Tesla uses are compatible with MITs new battery but either way the idea of that is awesome."
This is so awesome!! Impressive range and ludicrous performance from the Model S!! 
What ranges do similar gasoline cars have?
"$135k isn't that expensive.

If this was the local price I'd totally be electric but Australia is retarded so...."
0-100 in 2.7 seconds?! Lordt.
I officially declare ICE as obsolete.
0-100 in 2.7 seconds! That's batshit crazy
"I'd rather drive a Nissan Leaf, VW eGolf, Kia Soul EV or even a Chevy Spark than a Honda Accord. Once you have spent a considerable amount of time in an EV an ICE feels archaic in comparison. 

I'd also like to add that iPhones were crazy expensive to most people when they first came out. The ICE is dead if you ask me, there is no innovation left and it's an archaic technology that is being replaced in much the same way the car replaced the stage coach. "
A freedom-hating commie just told me that people don't need sports cars because they pollute and are wasteful... Lol
"Tesla: 315 miles on $12, 3.8 cents per mile.

Spyder: 22 mpg, [9.9 cents](http://gasprices.aaa.com/) per mile (2.6x).

LaFerrari: 13.8 mpg, 15.8 cents per mile (4.2x).

Not counting electric for the Spyder is unfair, since the 13.6 mile electric range would make a difference for errands etc, but still.  The P100D probably weighs over 5000 lbs, and the Spyder/LaFerrari weigh 3620/3495 lbs.  Even in all electric mode the Tesla gets 57% better mileage than the Porsche.

So it's not the quickest?
"That's what you get when you have constant torque from 0 rpm. Gas just cant compete with electric on so many levels, and this is just the beginning"
">That 75kWh battery is especially interesting because it’s actually identical to the battery available in the 60kWh Tesla Model S, but the additional cells are locked by the vehicle’s software. Customers can pay to ""unlock"" that additional battery capacity after they buy the car.

Wow. That's super shitty. Someone should crack the relevant software and post it for free on the internet."
"Don't be fooled, quick/=agile"
I dont like the new front.
"While its cool that this car can accelerate really fast and everything, asking for an extra ~60k for just 50 extra miles doesn't seem worth it to the average (guy who can afford a tesla) consumer."

"911 turbo s. Gtr. 

And the tesla can only do this once. "
Just had a 90D get locked in last week. Wonder if I defer a few months they'll auto upgrade it or give an option to pay for additional 10kWh battery.
"So I'm unclear on something. While the text on the release says P100D the article and all numbers only talk about the P100DL

"Taking into account that a 911 Turbo S with comparable performance costs double than the P100D, this new battery upgrade is still very good value.
Tesla should now focus on better cooling to make the performance versions track ready. Performance versions are low volume, but make the whole brand more appealing, desirable and aspirational."

I heard that tesla cells are made of 18650's.

Usually 18650's are measured in mAh, and usually the best ones out right now are around 3400mAh and powerbanks use mAh.

What's the difference between kWh, why do they use it for car batteries and can you convert mAh into kWh?

I think I remember that V x A = W.

So they factor in voltage?"

Tesla needs more crash test dummies for its beta-version half-baked cars
"They could have made it even more range with a 100D, but I think that Tesla wants to limit the 100kWh battery pack to higher margin P vehicles at the current time.

A 100D Model S could go over 325 miles."
That's not enough for me. I drive five miles to work and back every day. What if I forget to charge for a month?
"> I'm more excited about the extended range thanks to the battery upgrade. 315 miles is very impressive.

Frustratingly only on the P100D for now; No regular ""100D"" is available for those who want to maximize range over acceleration numbers. :("
"I'm just excited to get them in the showroom and start taking folks on test drives! 2.8 seconds never gets old, so 2.5 will be a breath of fresh air! Can't wait!"
"Yep. Plus there are loading stations everywhere, after driving for 300km its not that big of a problem to stop to a station that is on the way, even on the highway itself and grab something to eat. And its free so thats great"
thats seriously great from tesla !
I'd rather see range increased due weight reduction..
"I'll get more excited when they have swap-out batteries. That's the only way 'refuelling' is going to be fast and widespread.

When THAT happens, watch electric cars take off. (perhaps literally!?)"
"Why?  What can you do in 315 miles which you can't do in 290?

I have no idea why people care about this.

edit: still waiting for an answer."
"Yep, $500 increase for Autopilot"
"No word on new hardware in this yet, right?"
I was surprised by that as well. I wonder if that is an indication that is about to provide more value... in Version 8.0
I'd love to hear some official word on the reason for this price increase. I assume nothing was mentioned or we'd have heard by now.
"Basically someone puts their hand on your parked car and falls through it, because they're just seeing the afterimage"
"I'd presume the limit on acceleration from 0-60 for the Roadster at this point would be how good the tires are, not how much power can be delivered by the motor."
"Edmunds.com tested a Model S' stopping distance to be 108 feet from 60-0. Using that information as a base for assuming the limit of tire traction for the given weight of the vehicle, a Model S could theoretically accelerate 0-60 mph in ~1.23 seconds. 😳

Edit: /u/arcata22 pointed out that I can't math, and was off by a factor of two. The theoretical limit of the Model S is closer to 2.45 sec 0-60."
"Just for comparison sake:

* 2014 Porsche 911 Turbo S 0-60 MPH 2.9 sec 

* 2014 Ferrari F12 Berlinetta Spyder 0-60 MPH 3.1 sec

* 2013 BMW M5 0-60 MPH 3.8 sec 

* 2014 Bugatti Veyron 0-60 MPH 2.5 sec

It would be good to see them break into the 1's
Oh my god are they actually calling it plaid?
At what acceleration does it become physically unsafe to be in the driver's seat?
I'm hearing all of this in John Candy's voice (RIP)
I love them calling it maximum plaid.
"By the time Roadster 2.0 comes out, I am sure the Model S & X would already have at least P120D.

So with a much light <2,000kg Carbon Fiber chassis & AWD, it would probably be under 2 secs. Probably around 1.5 secs?

It would probably be the fastest commercially available car in the world, and Ferrari, Lambo & the other supercars would look pitifully slow in comparison."
"Re: ""maximum plaid"" -- I know that's what Musk called it, but it's not a thing in Spaceballs. In the movie, Spaceball One sets its speed to ludicrous, and goes to plaid while doing ludicrous speed. 

The roadster should just have ludicrous speed. It'll make more sense anyway to anyone who hasn't seen the movie. And it's not like it matters -- a ludicrous model S is faster than a ludicrous model X. So why not just make ludicrous their fastest trim?"
This is the most interesting take I've seen.
The only way that would happen would be with a massive increase in battery density. Otherwise it probably won't have the space. I'm all for it if they can though. Still have a year to improve battery technology. 
Imagine all the people
"I wonder if they will have a  P100D option for the Model 3. If they do, I'll definitely be ordering it!"
"> Elon Musk described the new P100D pack as “complex” and that Tesla will first focus on the performance P100D version and the 100D will follow “several months” later.

Complexity has nothing to do with it, they just give priority to the highest margin cars. $$"
Some people will be in for a shock at the light.. These folks and their coupes....
"The SUV is oddly priced (for all trims actually) relatively similar to the model S. 

You'd expect a much higher premium for a falcon wing, taller, longer, SUV. Especially considering they say it's so much harder to make. Why would they be selling it for less profit than the S?"
"Remember when the Model S P85+ was doing the 4.2sec numbers, and we thought that was fast..."
[deleted]
I suspect the 90 will eventually go away and will instead be the software-limited 100. 
"90 could be withdrawn in all realism, OR 80 would exist as a limited 100.

The limited batteries have shown a lot of promise in terms of longevity and charging time.

60 = 80% of 75.

80 = 80% of 100."
That seems like a decent spread to me. It's probably only 2 different packs (software limited for the 60 and 90) and gives multiple price points for various buyers
60 is same as 75.
"Yeah, I see no reason for 90KWh to exist anymore.

Also, from now on, they should just increase the top range while removing the lower range.

So 75KWh will replace 60KWh for the same price, 100KWh will replace 75Kwh for the same price, 130KWh will replace 100KWh for the same price, and so on. Onwards to 200KWh!"
Ventilated seats!?
"same reaction here, can't wait to try design studio :_)

Does this mean the back seats won't fold forward to make more room for cargo?
"Yeah, but they say only Model S P90D and P100D."
You beautiful bastard.
"/u/fredtesla please add a ""km/h"" behind the ""0-100"" in the acceleration stats, it's quite easy to think that 0-100mph is meant :) "
Hopefully following to the whole lineup.
And it's working for him.  The reason I have a model 3 reservation is specifically because an AWD P60 Model3 is going to blow the doors off a Bolt.
"> We don't build slow cars.

And then the Model 3 has a top speed of less than 130..."
It's either fear or your ICE has sprung a leak.
"I have driven the P90D with Ludicrous upgrade. It's unreal. You feel it in your chest and gut. The first time I did it, I felt like my vision wanted to tunnel. But after a few launches, you get comfortable with it and it's a blast. You feel so stable. There was never a time that I felt like we might lose control. I adore that car. 

That said, I've driven a Lamborghini before as well and even though the acceleration was slower, you can definitely feel the car trying to murder you. You can tell that if you don't concentrate on not dying, the car will take you. The Tesla felt nothing like that. Just safe and solid. Amazing car. "
"To be fair, consumer trends going back for several decades seem to indicate that almost no automobile consumers give a damn about 60 time. "
"I just hope batteries get lighter. The only thing that bums me out about electric cars is how heavy they are. For a luxury sedan that is also fast in a line it's fine, but for an actual sports car it'll be sad to see them start to weigh two tons. "
"> This kills the ICE.

Once. Then you overheat. 

Or if you're already traveling about 60 and some redneck in a base V8 Camaro pulls your 130k super sedan.
"
"ICE?

Immigration and Customs Enforcement?"
This kills the tires.
"As an ICE owner interested in racing, it would have to be a LOT cheaper for me to even consider it.  Even the model 3 is still way too expensive for me (and it has no gauges in line with the steering wheel which is just stupid).  And an ICE can still provide more consistent performance -- the tesla overheats in an actual race situation, and what percent of the battery does one 2.5s 0-60 run use?"
"What's most impressive is that it sacrifices nothing in other areas of performance, amenities and safety.

It's truly a revolutionary platform."
"ICEs don't have a problem with that

"Well it also means ""current production vehicle"". The two production cars that were quicker are no longer in production, and have long since all sold out, and so you can no longer buy them *new*, leaving the P100DL the undisputed quickest production vehicle you can currently buy new."

"There is a certain kind of person, who is not me, who must have the biggest, baddest, newest. For that person, there is the P100D. "
I'm still hoping the 40 kW comes back with ~160 mile range or so. The supercharger network is much more robust now than it was the first time they tried it. I would much rather have that than a Model 3. 
Same here honestly.
The point of that car is to be able to rape anything on the road and not about not making an extra stop at a supercharger -_-
"I can't justify upgrading from my S60. I would think I'd have to put about 100k into upgrading.

"Won't be long before the 75kwhr battery is replaced by an 85kwhr... coming full circle but at a much lower price point.

"FYI, the Tesla Roadster, with the 3.0 battery upgrade (R85), has nearly a 400 mile range."
"Strangely enough, there is no 100D in the design studio. Only 90D and P100D. "
"> You realize that this increase puts the 100D in at a 343 mile range?!

Actually 315 (estimated EPA rating).  The cells are the same, meaning they had to cram an extra ~800 of them in, adding weight."
Why does higher elevation make a difference? 
It's only 1.09 Gs. Which combined with gravity would feel like 1.48 Gs pushing you into the crevice of your seat.
"You're being downvoted for asking for information? Or maybe the 2.2 figure. Maybe 2.2 was on different tires or testing conditions.

Also, the 60-100 time is a matter of gearing and the way the hubs work, I believe"
"> 0-60 in 2.5 but 0-100 in 2.7?

100kmph == about 62mph, they probably just got slightly different results in the 2 different tests that they did separately, and the extra 2mph does of course take slightly longer to get to"
[deleted]
"Those 0-100 times can't be right. 0-60 in 2.5 but only .2 more seconds to get from 60-100?

Maybe that was 0-60mph and 0-100kph times?"
Mph vs kph 
"Do you think 2.7s vs 2.5s will feel that much different to regular people? When I drive a P90DL the acceleration varies by more than that much depends on the charge of the battery and I can never really tell the difference, other than it's very, very fast."
"If it helps, it looks like they raised the base price of the P90D by $5500 (and AP by $500), so you saved a good bit of money by ordering earlier."
At the Model 3 launch Elon stressed that this car was only possible because of those that bought the S and X. I'm guessing they'll keep saying it. And the S and X will continue to be the guinea pig for new tech that will eventually trickle down to the 3 and Y. 
"They are holding on to their resale value quite well; but yes, that could change."

"Also, just because a production car is the fastest to go from 0 - 100 km/h in a straight line, that doesn't mean it's the fastest production car overall. I'd bet everything in my bank account* it would get destroyed by a lot of other production cars on a track or on a straight longer than a 1/4 mile. 

*I only have like $5.00 in my account."
"i think the key word here is 'production car'. The 2 faster ones were limited edition $1mil+ 2door cars that you can no longer buy. This is a 4 door saloon family car. Also, if you didn't know, it's an all electric car."
How much do you think you could get for the old car? 
Looks like that was likely 0-100 kmph
Where did you get 312 wh from? 
The 100kwh is almost certainly heavier so the Wh/mi would increase.
"> Maybe that was 0-60mph and 0-100kph times?

yes"
"But that's also weird. 60 mi/h equals 96,5 km/h. So you need .2 seconds for 3,5 km/h. This looks like too much to me.



Let's take a look at the math.


0-60 mi/h in 2.5 s is equal to the addition of 2.4 mi/h per millisecond (assuming for the sake of simplicity that the acceleration is linear). Now apparently from 0-100 km/h it needs an additional 0.2 s so 4.8 mi/h or 7.72 km/h. 7.72 is more than the double of 3.5 which is the difference between 60 mi/h (96.5 km/h) and 100 km/h. Even when accounting the non-linear acceleration I doubt it would take twice the time for the last 0.2 s than the average acceleration time. There must be something wrong with the measurements in km."
Whats the P90D 0-100 time?
Mpg and 0-60 is a thing people do with a gas car. No different. 
I'm sure pretty much everyone can figure that out.
"Yes, this announcement is about upgrades to existing car models."
Because of the range? Why not. People have done cross country trips with Teslas.
"Tesla models  
Tesla Model S"
._.'
"It isn't currently in production, Tesla can keep claiming ""fastest 0-60 of any car currently in production"" until then.

ninja edit: wording"
"> That seems off.

Not really, just the way that physics works: http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/energy/Lesson-1/Kinetic-Energy

> K = 0.5 . m . v^2

In a ratio we then get:

> K_ratio = ( 0.5 . m . 60^2 ) / ( 0.5 . m . 62^2 )

Which is just:

> K_ratio = ( 60^2 ) / ( 62^2 ) = 0.93652445369

Therefore at 60mph the car has only put in ~94% of the energy required to get to 62mph. Now lets try the time ratio:

> T_ratio = 2.5 / 2.7 = 0.92592592592

The fact that those numbers correlate so well means that using velocity as your metric to compare to time is incorrect. You should be thinking in terms of energy coming out of the battery being turned into kinetic energy and the rate in at which that can happen."
"Its reseasonable to still like petrol cars. Being open minded is important and you still seem to accept that electric cars are the future. I don't understand the people that hate them for no apparent reason. Electric cars are just making their way back and they're already outperforming in some aspects(efficiency, off the line performance, instant torque which will be great for towing, charging at home, smoother ride, etc...). It's going to take 20-30 years for any significant change from petrol to electric anyway. Its important to keep moving forward and petrol cars are much harder to improve at this point than electric. An electric motor is nearing the limits of physics already as far as efficiency and batteries are far away from reaching the limits of physics in any aspect."
"Have you driven a Tesla? My test drive sold me. The thrill is different than hearing the engine roar but let me tell you, its there."
"Some people don't like the idea of an EV destroying ICE cars in performance... It signals the end of ICE vehicles, which is disconcerting.  We've lived with them and have cherished them for a very long time.  EV's most likely will end the love affair with cars to a large extent, as they will be seen more as appliances than marvels of engineering and the symbol of one's own freedom and power."
"Yes, but they aren't _currently_ in production. "
Isn't that a limited production car? So while technically correct I assumed Tesla was just stating full production car. 
"I'd bet heavily against them offering the 100 upgrade to existing owners other than 90. They've historically been very unwilling to offer physical battery upgrades and they don't show much sign of changing. 

Also, Elon previously stated that MAXIMUM PLAID will be reserved for the next roadster. Though that's on hold now with master plan part 2. So who knows. "
You could get 3 Model 3s for that 1 S
"I'm not, since this is way out of my league"
"As a sidenote, what is this plaid meme going around the thread about?"
Pretty sure what's listed is the only option. P90dl to 100 as the only option. 
"Apparently to be followed up with a 'maximum plaid' mode in the next Roadster, if Elon is to be believed. (as what else is beyond 'ludicrous'?)."

"The Chiron has also not yet entered production.

Customers haven't taken delivery.
"That's a limited-run, multi-million dollar vehicle. It's not classed as a ""production car."" "
"Yes (barely), but I think that falls into the same category as the Porsche 918 and LaFerrari that they mentioned--extremely expensive limited-production cars that aren't available to most people and aren't practical daily drivers. The fact that we're even comparing a four-door family sedan to the fastest hypercars the world has ever seen is just crazy."
But is it a mass produced 4 door sedan with huge storage space? What can you fit in a chiron? A bag of crisps?
"The ""old"" veyrons 1-60 speed is also 2,5..

But unlike the tesla, its top speed is just nuts..

Im sure VW could build a faster accellerating car if they wanted.. But theyve aimed at top speed"
I think they are still working on the design studio
"There's a Model S that set a Pikes Peak record that was modified I believe.

It was recently found abandoned at a Supercharger. 

Someone do this with a P100DL, just don't do the abandoning thing please."
This one apparently yes according to comments made at the announcement. They said this was pretty much the theoretical maximum pack capacity before the new cells come out.

"I'm guessing that they reckon Ludicrous is mostly only purchased by those who want the ultimate in acceleration, and for those customers there's no point in a P90D (ludicrous) now there's a P100D.

"
"No, they stayed the same price. They are still selling the p90d at the same price as well. This is just a pricier option."
"[not exactly the same, but Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/powerwall)"
"Yup, basically more power can be dumped from the battery into the motor. Ludicrous itself was originally brought in when they found to a way to make a fuse that could handle an exceptionally high current without melting it. The parallelism of the cells will be key for this. And how they're interconnected in the pack.

"It will probably start with 200+ miles and be low performance.  
Knowing Tesla the top end of it will be about 3.5x the base price, so even in what will probably be a compact car you can beat out ICE cars."
Tesla has no plans for a sub $25k car.  
"If the 20% increase is worth it to the consumer, why does that make them the ""apple"" for offering it .. what is your point?


You could instead stick with the ICE vehicle and not be able to replace the 6cyl for the 8cyl or increase the gas tank capacity/etc without heavy modifications.."
"The refresh P90D can run as low as a 10.8 second quarter with the right config, Huracan can do a 10.4 and I think a 911tt can do around a 10.5-10.6. So it's unlikely that the P100D will be faster than either of them, but it would be quite a good race up to 120 mph or so. That's pretty impressive. "

Pretty sure that's 0-100 kilometers per hour
Most likely 0-100 km/h
60mph and 100kph
it's either 0-100 kph is 2.7 or its an additional 2.7 on top of the 2.5 = 5.2 to 100mph which would put it on par with the current hyper cars

5 seconds hasn't really been relevant for a while. My 6 year old non-m entry level bmw cuts it in 4.7. The new $35k Camaro SS can get to 60 in under 4 seconds. Most $100k+ awd performance cars produced in the past 5 years are close to or under the 3 second mark.
"If you mean similar in price and sedan style a new ctsv will go 375 miles on the highway and has the exact same 1/4 mile time.

"That impressed me far more than 2.5s to 60mph. 8% more time for 67% more speed. What in the fuck.

It's almost dangerously fast, haha."
ICE won't be obsolete until the price comes down.  This new package is 5+ years of income to some people.    It's still exciting to see the range and power of this new option however. 
The Model S still isn't a track car.

"It's actually not shitty, because they could just take the 60kWh option away and sell a 75kWh as their cheapest option.

Or maybe just give 60kWh owners 15kWh extra cells for better wear-leveling and charge them less money? I fail to see how that's shitty.

Somehow you think they're swindling people out of extra battery. If you want 60 and ask for 60 and pay for 60 but get 60 with an extra 15 to extend the life of your battery, where's the problem?"
And say goodbye to warranty/service/updates.

"> or be acquired by one

That's not going to happen. The only time that Elon considered selling Tesla was if they ran out of money back in 2012:

> I think even in the absolute worst case scenario, Tesla has created a lot of intellectual property, we've over 250 patents, and obviously if we're supplying powertrains and battery packs to Toyota and Mercedes, they see value in Tesla too. Our production is sold out for the next seven months. So, I think even if we weren't able to execute, we'd still have value as an acquisition target for intellectual property, but obviously I think that's a very worse case scenario. The most likely scenario is that we will indeed become profitable next year and, in fact, cash-flow positive next month.

(Source: http://shitelonsays.com/transcript/a-solid-year-for-tesla-2014-07-10)

But these days there is no chance of that. Short term, so long as Tesla is making money then Elon will never sell it to anybody else. 

Long term, he'll sell when the vision:

> to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible

has been reached."
"Or twice. Or 20x times. I know that you want to be mean, but you should not lie."
I've taken my S60 to the drag strip. Saw no noticeable decrease in speed over 10 runs.
"Direct quote from the linked article:

> Tesla customers who have ordered a P90D Ludicrous, but not taken delivery, can upgrade to the 100 kWh pack for $10,000. Existing P90D Ludicrous owners can also upgrade to a 100 kWh pack, but for $20,000, as their used 90 kWh pack will have to be recycled."
"From the article, it seems if you contact Tesla they will upgrade you for ten grand."
"100 km, not 100 miles"
kilometers
has to be typo
At a charge station you can get your entire battery hotswapped faster than you could fill your tank
"Yes, you multiply mAh by voltage to get kWh.

A 3400 mAh battery @ 3.7 V will have less energy than a 3400 mAh battery @ 12 V, so it makes no sense to just give the amperage unless the voltage is standardized.

The Tesla battery pack is 375 volts(?).  Divide 375 V by kWh and so a 100 kWh battery pack has 3.75 kAh (3750000 mAh).

A 3400 mAh battery at 12 V would be 0.0408 kWh."
"Forced AI to control driving will kill enthusiasm far quicker than a vehicle which is breathtaking to drive, has no awkward gears (a kludge), and makes an incredible space-type sound to replace that rumbling vibration that ICEs have.

Unless you think changing the oil gives the car 'soul'..."
.
"100kph, not mph."
"kph, not mph"
Yeah such a small feat making the quickest production car in the world.
"Yes, this breaks through 3 psychological barriers

1) 100 kWh

2) The quickest car you can buy at any price

3) Over 300 miles of range

Sells these puppies as fast as you can, then add in the more reasonable options for people who just need the range."
"Likely issues with a broad release of the 100kWh battery:

1. It requires the new Panasonic 2170 form factor (which explains the retrofit option for P90Ds - new battery type, higher density, same pack size). So Tesla may be supply constrained, and introducing it in limited fashion for now because of that.

2. Releasing on a limited ""premium only"" fashion pushes demand toward higher profit margin vehicles. The announcement is very explicit in stating that purchasing a P100D Ludicrous is fundamentally an investment in Tesla's mission, not a financially rational decision.

3. Due to the direct sales model Tesla has a unique situation: it needs a constant rate of production, but has potentially variable demand. Slowly leaking out updates, OTAs, and keeping ""the newest/ most advanced tech for the premium products"" is a way of regulating demand to keep production equal to demand. Tesla has a lot of unique opportunity in that it has many product options it can announce to stimulate demand. It will hold each of those Trump cards in reserve to maintain stable demand.

Every site visit, every build of a vehicle, every IP address, cookies, return visits to the site... ALL of this data is collected and is analyzed to predict how demand will change after each ""announcement"". Maybe that is creepy, but it is a highly cost effective means of utilizing free data. 

TL;DR There are certainly multiple factors in the pie chart of ""why is the 100kWh battery limited to only the most premium model (for now)"". Each factor is relevant, and had an impact; some factors are more impactful than others - If supply is limited Tesla needs to roll out slowly; if supply isn't constrained, then maintaining steady demand in a ""direct sales"" model is likely the largest factor in ""trickling"" out reveals - be it the 100kWh battery, AP 1.0 v8, AP 2.0 hardware being in every vehicle, etc, etc. The larger Tesla becomes the more it has to act as a consistent, stable large-cap, and the less it can risk the ""agility"" of a small-cap start-up. Risk is always relative to market cap.

EDIT: Whoa. Gold? I don't have a speech prepared, so, simply, but seriously, thank you! I'd genuinely promote Tesla every second of every day if gifted a base S60, gift my Volt to a friend to pay it forward, and immediately pay to upgrade to AP and unlock the 75kWh package... Just sayin', but seriously, I would absolutely do all of that. Ahem, Elon... if you're reading this...

EDIT 2: I was 100% incorrect on #1 (Tesla may be supply limited due to a new form factor). Thorough and accurate rebuttal someone graciously wrote:

https://electrek.co/2016/08/23/tesla-100-kwh-battery-pack-quickest-car-ever/

1 . According to electrek, the pack uses the same 18650 cell as in the existing 90D .. not 100% clear if they mean the same form factor only or the exact same capacity, they're simply packing them more densely.

> For the 100 kWh battery pack, Tesla is using the same battery cell, but a new module and pack architecture, new cooling system and electronics. CTO JB Straubel described the upgrade as a “significant change”.

and

> Musk made it clear during a press conference that this upgrade will be the limit of the current pack form with the current battery cell. Any upgrade in energy capacity would only become available with the new battery cell

2 . Production likely to be quite limited initially. Makes sense to limit to high-end models only for now. As production ramps up, it can be sold in the ""lower-end"" 100D models. This conveniently gives Tesla another PR opportunity as the 100D will likely have ~340 miles of range.

> Elon Musk described the new P100D pack as “complex” and that Tesla will first focus on the performance P100D version and the 100D will follow “several months” later.

"
"They did note that there will eventually be a 100D ""several months later."""
"Assuming the same ~9% loss (8.889% if you want to get picky) that the P90D has under the 90D, the 100D could see an EPA range of 345 miles."
A 100D Model 3 could likely push 370 miles.
"How far would the model 3 go with the new battery pack, that range would be really interesting i think "
"He's not the guy we wanted, but the guy we deserved.

Way to be that guy.

Side note, at 315 miles I could go to work for a week and just hit up a super charger on sundays and be fine..."
"Not even P100D, it's only P100DL. You have to get ludicrous mode to get the 100. "
Do you guys let people push them as hard as they want on a test drive?
"The car is already very lightweight. The only heavy part is the battery. I'm sorry, but I'd rather keep the Model S as heavy as possible.

It feels more solid and more premium. If you want a Miata or an Elise, buy a Roadster."
They already have swap out batteries. People aren't interested in paying the extra price at the one swap station.
Drive across the state to see my family for the holidays. There are many routes that do not fall along the Supercharger network and thus aren't practical without more range.
LA to Vegas is a nail biter.
"Well, evtripplanner says that Tucson to Flagstaff takes 304 Rated Miles, so the extra makes a trip like that theoretically possible on one charge. I imagine that every bit that eliminates a Supercharger stop or gets you to a destination charger will flip more potential customers who have some route in mind that for one reason or another is a dealbreaker."
"When it comes to range of an EV, you don't feel like more is better?  Did you get the lowest-range option for your Roadster (were there options?  I wasn't in the market at the time...)?

For an S or an X this means there will be trips where you can skip a supercharger stop, and even on the trips where you can't you can potentially spend less time charging."
"You don't have to buy one.  Sales figures will show if there's demand for the extra range, as was the case with the 90."
"Long range is needed for long local trips...150 miles one way, 150 miles back with no charging ability at the destination. "
"Give it up.  Range = Flexibility.  It means someone could go Phoenix to Vegas non stop at the speed limit or Phoenix to Vegas without having to stop late at night at the ghetto Kingman SC, like I have had to do.  It also means I could stop once on my most traveled trip to CA instead of twice or more if the wind gets strong.  Most owners I know recommend to new buyers to go for the largest pack size they can afford.  I'll definetly pay extra for additional range when I am ready to upgrade my S.  

Start decreasing pack size to leaf levels and the logic breaks down quickly. "
"It's incremental improvement. Next time, it's 340 miles, then 365, which is significantly higher than 290."
"With 315 miles of range, I can drive back and forth to work Monday through Friday for 4 weeks and 1 day without recharging.  With 290 miles, I'd have to charge before the month was over.

I drive a Leaf, which has terrible range, but my commute is only 15 miles round trip, so even if it's range dropped by 50%, I'd have abundant range."
"Well, my family and I drive to NC about ten times a year from MA. That's a little less than two full tanks of fuel for us. We love the freedom of driving random routes along the way without any worry of running out of fuel. We can't really do that without being on a supercharger path. I really want this car, but we might actually go with a Mercedes S-Class because of range anxiety. We're going to cross shop the two. Our magic number is 375 rated miles. The moment that happens we're a definite customer. So, that's my reason why. Different strokes. "
"Hopefully thats because they're going to be installing the new hardware soon..

[deleted]
"Everyone here is thinking along the wrong path. IC engines have a torque curve. You need to ""launch"" at a certain RPM to make the power. This causes enormous stress on the traction with the road, and with the car it's self. 

Remember though, the torque curve on an electric car is almost flat. It is also completely computer controlled. If it determines that there is wheel slip on launch, it will keep the motor running on the ragged limit of the tires *the whole time.* they can integrate the tcs system and the electric motor like you can never do with an IC engine. 

My guess for Plaid is going to be pretty deep into the 1 second group. Something like 1.7 seconds 0-60"
"The massive weight of the Models S and X also helps them have a lot of traction off the line. If the Roadster isn't as heavy, it might not be able to accelerate as quickly."
Traction is as much dependent on weight distribution and suspension geometry as it is on the tractive limit of the contact patches. You could end up needing thousands of HP to make up the lost speed in the fraction of a second you are actually able to use it.
Upvote for giving me a 'duh' moment... this calculation makes perfect sense (in hindsight)!
So basically we're at the theoretical limit and they need new tires before they can increase it meaningfully.
This is insane.  up vote

Really hope Tesla can come up with a solution for their next Roadster, even if that means it costs more.

Tesla had a difficult sell to those that would like to drive hard, since they putter out after 4 or 5 minutes on the track."
Another fun fact a Cheetah can accelerate from 0-60 in 2.5-3.0 seconds.

"Nope, it will all be tire limited.

The Model S is still slow in 0-100mph and beyond when compared to supercars, we'll probably see huge improvement acceleration above 60mph and actual supercar competing quarter-mile times."
[deleted]
"Supercars aren't really about acceleration though. I'll be more curious to see racetrack times - I'd want whatever replaces the Roadster to be able to run flat out around a racetrack without overheating, and have handling, braking, and higher speed acceleration (60-120+) sufficient to compete with things like the higher end Corvettes, 911s, that kind of thing. 0-60 is nice, but it really isn't all that meaningful for most high end supercars now (and 1.5 seconds is a pipedream on any current streetable tire)"
Wait the car will with a lot less so they will mean less grip and less acceleration
Mother of God
Also mostly unlikely. The 3 is smaller so there just isn't enough space to put such a big battery.
"Probably starts at 60k though, but yeah maybe 500 miles of you stretch it."
He stated in the press release that they would be switching over to a new battery technology over the next couple years that should offer some solid improvement in terms of density and performance.

"Err, nothing will be physical 100kWh and be software limited. It requires a totally different kind of pack. 

Right? Isn't that what they were saying?"
"90 kWh packs are still a hardware thing - they are just ramping up the build of the 100 kWh packs.
"
Wasn't that his point? 
I can't fathom the efficiency gains vs weight for a 200KWh in this form factor to work.
"I agree, but the 60kWh is just too cheap to pass up. $58,500 after tax rebates! Cheapest Tesla in history, besides early 40kWh models.

In a perfect world, range would be mostly disconnected from price, or at least not as closely tied. That's probably the direction we're heading. as the 20kWh difference between 50kWh and 70kWh (for Model 3) will cost only about $2,000...

The DLC battery pack thing is cool for now, but I think eventually people will start getting annoyed with it.. as useful as it is for Tesla, the popularity of such a business model usually doesn't last.."

Son of a bitch!!!!! I wanted those seats when I got my car last year

"They definitely are updating it right now, try playing with it, you'll get some errors asking you to refresh it.

One trademark of the S is all the room. I don't think they will be changing that.. (hopefully)
"Is that sass?  ;)

For S owners' sake, I sure as hell hope not."
I don't understand why ventilated seats wouldn't just be part of the premium package across all trims. What does a vented seat have to do with battery capacity? Insanity. I would never buy a car with leather seats that aren't ventilated. 
That's what I thought when I read that. 0-100 mph in 2.9 would be more than ludicrous. Plaid even!
"Also, at such quick accelerations, the difference between 0-60mph and 0-100km/h is significant. "
It's gonna blow of the doors of more then just a Bolt...
"Top end is so over rated. Very rarely are you, or should you ever, have a car red lined on the hwy. Just asking for trouble. The fun of speed is all in the acceleration. It's all software limited anyways, it's not like the car couldn't go faster. "
What's that weird sound and smelly funny looking air coming from your ICE? Because I think it just shart itself with fear. 
But seriously at these accelerations topical wet sump ICE engines have serious oiling issues.
"> But after a few launches, you get comfortable with it and it's a blast. 

It's actually because the max acceleration is only reached when the battery is above 98%, and with decreasing battery it comes with decreasing performance.

Funny thing is that I actually like the drama and violence of an ICE supercar, when I'm in the mood that is. Once I floored a McLaren at 60mph and it felt like getting rear ended by a cargo train and the speedo climbed to triple digits before I could even realize what was happening. With the Tesla it was the opposite, after about 50mph the acceleration was only on par with a M3."
"> You can tell that if you don't concentrate on not dying, the car will take you.

This is the difference between a car like a Tesla that is made to be driven, and a min-maxed hypercar that allows you to drive it... until it doesn't!"
"But the people who tend to buy and can afford these top spec cars do.

Also the best car of the automaker usually defines their ability to make the best out of their own engineering knowledge. It's these cars that teenagers dream of, not your average comfortable and 'family friendly' etc Ford Fiesta or something like that."
"I think what it illustrates best is that the upper limit for EV performance hasn't been reached yet, and it serves best as a message to other manufacturers to get started on making good EVs.

It's quite embarrassing that nobody has yet built a mass production EV that has a range similar to a 2007 Tesla Roadster, a 9 year old car."
"True, but it generates a lot of headlines, which helps promote Tesla.  Keep in mind there are still a lot of people who don't even know there's a 200mi EV on the market, let alone 300mi."
"But some people do prefer ""faster"", ""sportier"" cars, right? 

Or is that a minority? Very few people would care if all cars had 10s 0-60 times? I just think most people have never owned a sub 4s 0-60 car, so they don't know what they're missing, right? I mean, yeah, pretty much nobody cares between 8s or 10s. "
Ummm GT-R. Nobody would buy that car if didn't have that 0-60 time in 2009. 
"Enough do to push the creation of fast cars. There are sub genres of movie, music, and politcs centered around fast cars."
"Only billions of dollars of super high gross margin revenue, but almost no consumers.

Right hmmmm :-/"
"Consumers in general, of course. But stats like 0-60 in sub-3 seconds appeal to even the most rigid car enthusiast, much in the same way the absurd safety ratings appeal to the conventional families."
That doesn't seem right. If so then why is it so often reported by car makers for their sportier cars? 
"People buying vehicles in that price range are usually buying performance luxury or sports cars, and they *do* care about 0-60. Sure your run of the mill person that buys a ford/toyota/chevy may not care about the 0-60, but they aren't buying a $140,000 car."
quick off the line is the only thing that matters in city driving though
You are not in alignment with reality.
"A 100 kWh battery would weigh in the neighborhood of 1350 lbs, and the motors weigh roughly 550 lbs.  The Roadster used an Elise body.  That Elise weighed 2006 lbs with an ICE engine, with 65 lb of gas, ~90 lb transmission, 29 lb oil cooler, ~30 lb exhaust, ~30 lb battery and 214 lb engine.  This still includes engine intake, some extra frame, axles, differential, gas tank and various plastics and hoses, but there probably isn't more than 50-100 lbs extra to strip off.  All that brings the weight down to 1548 lbs, though.  

That'd be 3350-3450 lbs for a Roadster 2, right around the same level as almost all of the super/hypercars.  The Tesla would have to be significantly smaller to manage that though, as the large majority of the weight would be in the drivetrain."
Damn those rednecks! Ruining life for tree-huggers since high school!
"Not really; if you're getting to 60 that fast, you're not wasting any time spinning the wheels. Plenty of slower cars that don't put the power down as effectively probably burn rubber faster. "
"This is what blows my mind. It's a 5  (or 7 with kids) seats sedan, which is the safest car on the road with plenty of baggage space and autopilot. Plus the acceleration.

Like this is awesome. It's weird people don't talk about this more."

"I know this is the tesla subreddit, and i'm blown away about this too, but come on man. There's been tons of other cars with 2.5 second or quicker 0-60 times, don't act like it's something that has never been done before.."
"Huh... how is ICE dead when the cheapest EV with more than 200 mile range on the market right now starts at $60k?

I mean, 2.5s 0-60 is good and all, and it's great that a $150k EV can now beat a $250k Ferrari at a stoplight drag race, but it's completely irrelevant to 99.9% of the consumers out there."
Copy that; updated 20700 and added 2170.
"My P85D's max power mode frequently takes 20 minutes to take effect, so it's rarely used. "
"Opposite actually, 1 foot rollouts substantially reduce the time."
Drag Times got a 2.65 sec 0-60 in a new P90DL on all season tires. 2.5 sec seems like an achievable time for a more powerful pack and some grippier summer tires.
"> includes corrections for temperature and altitude, which have far less impact on EV vs ICE

Wouldn't that mean the S is even quicker?"
"And certain people who can afford it, their 30 minutes at a supercharger IS worth 70k. Who is not me also."
"I'm excited enough for ventilated seats that I intend to sell my P90DL and get another S.  And well, if 100 is available, why not?"
"i was in that mindset when i ordered my p90d, if the p100d and p90d were on sale at the same time i still would opt for the p90d. i would not be able to swing the extra 20k. that and there comes a time, redditor, when the lower decimal points cease to matter, when the acceleration becomes problematic, when all other cars become uninteresting, and all that is left is a computer driving you to work. "
"Why not buy a used 60 kW? Same price as you'd expect from a 40 kW, but better range and better status props than a Model 3."
"You're probably right. 

My S85 isn't old, it's just ahead of its time!"
I wonder how many of those 3.0 upgrades they've sold.
"Yeah, they've said the 100D will come out in a few months. I think they want to snag the early adopters as well as use up the remaining piles of 90 kwh battery packs they have hanging around. "
"315 for the P100D which suffers a range penalty compared to the ""regular"" D. 

If the 90D gets the same 16% range increase, it comes to 343 miles."
"Lower air density; plus less oxygen which results in less power for ICE engines unless they have force induction that compensates for it.

Though on the other hand, the fastest versions of the P85 and P90 go less quick as the battery charge % goes down, something that usually doesn't happen with ICE cars and their fuel tank."
Where does the .39 come from? Is that the portion of gravity due to the seat being angled?
There's usually not that much of a difference when testing the two speeds. The numbers don't make sense at all
.2 seconds just to go another 2 mph?
[deleted]
100 km/h is 62in mph. There shouldn't be that much of a difference
"Personally, I don't think a regular person can tell the difference.  Every.single.person I've had in my P90D go nuts when I launch in launch mode and say it's the most amazing acceleration they've ever been in."
Oh heck yea that helps.  Thank you!
Battery technology improves too. 100kwh may become the starting pack size in a few years.
"Yeah, this was in the other article about it: ""Tesla is also introducing the new Tesla Premium Seats, originally available in the Model X, to the Model S, but only for the P90D and P100D."""
People in the future jailbreaking their cars for another .2 second boost.
"There's no formal definition of what constitutes a production car. Go over to /r/autos or /r/cars or /r/carporn. Chances are good that you'll see at least one 918, LaFerrari, or McLaren P1 on the front page. Nobody cares that they're limited edition cars. People respect them for what they can do.

Besides, Musk loves to compare the Model S to the McLaren F1 (which he has owned), despite the fact that there are even fewer F1's than there are LaFerrarri's, 918's or P1's in the world. He sure doesn't mind that it's ""limited production"" when the Model S has as good a quarter mile time as the F1."
Energy Analyzer app in the car.
Then for the first time ever Tesla is delivering a pack which has more power than advertised.
Don't forget that these figures are only accurate to 1 tenth of a second. So it could potentially be 0-60mph in 2.54s and 0-100kmh in 2.65s which is only 0.11s difference now. 
"Nope, it gets much harder to accelerate, that's why it takes an additional 4.5-5 seconds to go from 60-100mph.

"I'd be surprised if the transition doesn't happen faster than 20-30 years. I expect that within 5-8 years a normal, uninformed buyer, will be somewhere around 30% odds of going EV. At that point, every major auto manufacturer will HAVE to have decent options (and make them readily available). "
"The end of ICE doesn't have to be the end of a love for cars. Look how many people are engaging with Tesla right now 

The internal combustion engine is still awesome engineering but it's not efficient and it's toxic to use. Cars have a lot to answer for in pollution. 

The awesome instant torque and ridiculous acceleration is a side effect of the most powerful electric drivetrains that have been developed and I really want to see one stuck into a milk float. 

Space. "

"There's no legal definition of 'production' car.

Guinness World Records, for example, requires 25 vehicles.

The Porsche 918's 918 cars is well above that."
"Sorry for delay.

I just read this article

http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/08/23/tesla-model-s-is-now-the-third-fastest-production-vehicle-on-the-market/

Hope that works"
"Do Usain Bolt's world records still count after he retires?

Being the ""quickest production car"" and being the ""quickest car currently in production"" are two very different things."
"Nope, he means acceleration beyond just 0-60. For example, the LaFerrari does 0-60 in 2.4 seconds, while a Tesla model S P90D ludicrous does it in 2.6. Not much of a difference, or? But do a quartermile, and the LaFerrari completes it in 9.7s at 149 mph, while the Tesla does it in 10.8 at 122 mph. Electric cars are fast from a standing start, but eventually the acceleration peters out.

At the end of the quartermile, most other fast sportscars will overtake the Tesla and easily pull away because of this. For example, the Corvette Z06 is much slower 0-60 than the Tesla, but they both have about the same quartermile time, and at the end the Corvette has a higher speed (132mph), which means it would be about to overtake the Tesla right at that point. Plus, of course (not really that important for everyday driving), the Tesla has a limited top speed of 155mph."

Huh?  They've already been [delivered to dealerships.](https://youtu.be/ghreRhjUrZU)
"I'd assume at least some have, since dealerships have already [taken delivery of some.](https://youtu.be/ghreRhjUrZU)"
"The rule generally used is 500 produced, coincidentally (not at all) exactly the number of Chirons that will be built.  It's technically a production car as far as records go."
"The claim is quickest production car to 60 mph. So his question was valid. Only the Chiron is not in production. The Wikipedia list shows the 918 and LaFerrari getting to 60 in 2.4 s. But again, those are very different cars to the Model S. 

Edit: I've realised the claim excludes limited production runs of the 918, LaFerrari and Chiron. "
Yup looks that way.  First time I configed it didn't have the white seats available.   Seems like the design studio is getting hammered right about now.  
Do you mind providing a link? Would love to read about it. Thanks :)
But why increase the price for the non-Ludicrous P90D by that much? 
"It is but it is *very* limited production, they're only producing 8 total."
"But the next one is going to be 35k right? Well, I've read that Elon wants everyone to have an electric vehicle; 35k is still unattainable by most Americans."
yeah 11 second factory family sedans are ridiculous even in theory
is that the point?
Where does Tesla specify that when they say the p100d is the fastest accelerating car in the world that they are only referring to cars with 5 or more seats that no one in the right mind would buy for its dynamic abilities?
"Nissan GT-R will put you pretty darn close for the same, or even less amount of money and it can seat four. It would also whoop a Tesla on a track."
"One thing I found interesting: when you select premium package, it says that only front seats are ventilated but you can clearly see that back seats change too on the visual preview... Someone had to put it there for some reason."
That makes more sense
"Doesn't change what my banger is up to, and it's still fast AF"
"Yeah, I think you're right."

What gave it away? The optional kids seats in the back?
Well ICE supercars are fucked at least. All the hype/press coverage about fast and cool cars will transition to electric helping to further the transition and focus of major car producers to create electric cars.  
let us dream

"source? Why would they use 2.5 0-60 miles and the next line say 2.7 0-100 but now it's kmh all of a sudden?

ninja edit: i know it seems a bit crazy but it's not very clear from the top post..."
"> literally just one level

That's a bit harsh. Electric cars are also highly responsive, much cheaper per mile to drive, require less maintenance, have energy efficient and effective all wheel drive using multiple motors, charging on road trips is free(for Teslas) and come zombie apocalypse you can charge it using any number of renewable energy sources.

Also from a production standpoint, electric vehicles have a lot of room for improvement. Performance and range will continue to improve, and the cost of batteries will continue to fall. 20 years from now gas really won't be able to compete."
"Yeah except you can never have a gas car being as safe as an EV due to the massive steel engine reducing crumped space in a collision.

And that's just *one* more argument, and it happens that people care a hell of a lot more about safety than track performance.

I don't understand why you're so idiotic. Please try to do something about it."
On a recent podcast a caller brought up an interesting point.. He said that Tesla is basically selling you a locked box.. if you can somehow manage to open that box the content is yours.. They would also then have to prove that your hacking somehow broke something and even still it cant void your entire warranty.
Even shittier.
Which is why I'm not hyped or happy in the slightest about this.
"No, the battery only allows this once. Twice, if it was fully charged. 

I know you don't know what you mean, but not doing so is unintentionally lying. "
Yours doesn't have a ludicrous mode
"If they would throw in the ventilated seats with it, I'd do it for sure."
"Yah, article says p90d, alas I have a lowly 90d."
"20k, nuts to that!"
"It simply have to be. If both were mph, it means 60–100 mph in 0.2 seconds. That's acceleration of more than 9[g](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force). This kind of acceleration will literally pull your eyeballs in."
OHHHH
"That would make a whole lot more sense, in which case OP needs to do an edit. Still, that's mind-boggling for a sedan."
"I don't think that is a thing.  

But I am loving /u/Reaganson's argument. Is that the final hidey hole that ICE's have left. I go on a 300 mile round trip ...  well never any more ... but when i was younger I used to do it 3 - 4 times a year and on those road trips the thought of losing an addition 40mins would have been unbearable considering I would be saving $30 - 50 each time /s"
"Ah, I see. Great explanation thanks mate.

So I'm guessing why mobile/laptop powerbanks are only given mAh is that they are standardized and everyone assumes that it's 5V? I wonder why they stopped at mAh though, when Vh would be easier to compare for all batteries?

Making a lot more sense to me now. Cheers.

Edit: 

So lets say I wanted to find out how many 18650's are in the battery pack.

Apparently the batteries they make is very similar to the NCR18650B. It outputs 3.7V so assuming each one is 3400mAh, it would be 12580mVh per battery.

100,000,000mVh is the new battery pack divided by 12580mVh. Roughly 7950 batteries in each pack?

Did I do that right? Haha."
"I like an engine sound. Its one of the most exciting things about a performance car. Have you ever heard a ferrari? They sound special. They look special. Teslas are quick as a byproduct of the nature of electric motors, not as a design choice. The death of the car happened as soon as they put electric motors in porsches and ferraris. The soul is gone."
You seem to think that 0-100 in 2.5s isn't a reasonable necessity....
my car gets around 350 and I have to pay for gas ... wtf
"When new Top Gear starts, I seriously hope they'll show this car, simply because of its awesomeness. Even though they're all petrolheads.

I'm sure Jeremy would be very surprised, as I think he did drive a Tesla few years ago and it ran out of battery rather fast, but this should last a looooong time."
"The issue with Tesla and ALL other electric cars is they simply do not deliver the 300 miles in a lot of real life examples. The biggest problem with the electric industry is range anxiety fueled by not understanding that every driver drives differently and coming short of distance promises, not the initial range number. The EPA should enforce estimates on electric range and not allow brands to only list the highest possible distances, in the same way the EPA gives a range for actual gas mileage. 

Then the next problem with electric cars is all the bullshit data out there. Using surveys instead of registration numbers is one of my favorites to show loyalty.  Based on registration electric buyers only return at a loyalty rate of less than 50%. There is a reason for that. 

Electric car companies and the big auto makers coming to the market soon (I'm looking at your Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen) need to make sure they don't over promise. Especially the new competitors if they want to compete with current top dog. "
"There are 2 production cars that are faster from 0-60 and 2 that have the same 0-60.  And there are plenty of non-production cars that are a lot faster from 0-60.  And a shit ton of cars that will rip ahead from 60mph+.  But yes, all things considered, it is extremely quick, though that is to be expected with electric motors."
"""at any price"" There's a couple faster street legal cars than the tesla according to an article I read today.. . Though they're both more than a million dollars. "
"Number 2 isn't quite the seller I guess. A Nissan GTR can do almost the same, cost half of what the Tesla costs, can reach up to 193mp/h (310km/h) and probably can go for like 450 miles (700km). They start at 70.000$ I think."
"Yeah but I can't drive from Paris 
 to Delhi while not stopping for less then 10 minutes at a time! 

/s"
"I agree that demand generation, margin maximization and limited production capacity are all factors in this rollout. A car is never a financially rational decision, but I love driving my S every day and the new P100DL is a fraction of the cost other cars with that kind of acceleration such as the Porsche 918 or La Ferarri.  

This type of car is so overkill for me because I can make my wife sick at half the acceleration my car is capable of, but it will help to grow the tent of Tesla owners and finance the completion of the gigafactory and model 3 production. Once the general public gets a taste of electric torque at an affordable cost the market will quickly tilt towards electrics."
"https://electrek.co/2016/08/23/tesla-100-kwh-battery-pack-quickest-car-ever/

1 . According to electrek, the pack uses the same 18650 cell as in the existing 90D .. not 100% clear if they mean the same form factor only or the exact same capacity, they're simply packing them more densely.

> For the 100 kWh battery pack, Tesla is using the same battery cell, but a new module and pack architecture, new cooling system and electronics. CTO JB Straubel described the upgrade as a “significant change”.

and

> Musk made it clear during a press conference that this upgrade will be the limit of the current pack form with the current battery cell. Any upgrade in energy capacity would only become available with the new battery cell

2 . Production likely to be quite limited initially. Makes sense to limit to high-end models only for now. As production ramps up, it can be sold in the ""lower-end"" 100D models. This conveniently gives Tesla another PR opportunity as the 100D will likely have ~340 miles of range.

> Elon Musk described the new P100D pack as “complex” and that Tesla will first focus on the performance P100D version and the 100D will follow “several months” later.

"
"> It requires the new Panasonic 2170 form factor

It is been widely reported that the 100kWh battery uses the same cells as the older batteries."
"I thoroughly agree with the overall sentiment of your post,  However, #1 is not correct.  Maybe the info wasn't known at the time of your post, but Elon stated on the call that these are the same cells currently used in every Model S.  This means they managed to fit more of them in the same pack (~800 more) and heavily re-designed the cooling to handle additional cells.  JB confirmed a major re-design of the cooling system."
And another press event/release.
Does that mean the 3 would be in that range or better?
"More like 390. They're already talking about it having a sub-60Kwh battery for 215 miles of range, which probably means 55Kwh. Do the math, and you end up with 390.

And battery density keeps getting better, so we're not too many years away from a 100Kwh Model 3 (or something comparable) that could do well over 400 miles."
This is ludicrous.
Keep it on the down low. :D
And you have to get 100 to get Ludicrous.  The P90DL is no longer available.
"Yeah, it's included in the price."
Schedule a test drive and see for yourself!
"At almost 5,000lbs???   If the car is lighter it will go faster and handle better..."
"Oh. I had heard it was not currently possible to swap them out easily.

If it was, then there would be a store of batteries at every petrol station, where you swap empty for full at a cost between the price of the electricity, and a tank of petrol, and you could be merrily on your way."
"There are many routes which don't have gas stations and aren't practical, but you don't take those routes, or you go off them when you need gas.

What I'm asking is what specifically can you do in 315 miles which you can't do in 290?

There are a group of people who have just finished driving around the entire world in EVs, and another group who did the same thing 4 years ago when there were far fewer charging stations available - and one of the cars which did it 4 years ago was a Citroen C-Zero with 62 miles of range (the other was a Tesla Roadster with ~240).  So I really do not see how this would make a material difference in the life of anyone except the tiniest corner case."
"Theres two superchargers on that route (four, if you count Vegas and Rancho Cucamonga) and everyone I know stops somewhere whenever they do that drive, no matter what car they're driving.  Usually that somewhere is either Barstow or Stateline...which happen to be where the chargers are.

25 miles, the difference between the ranges of the 90 and 100, takes about 4 minutes supercharging."
"As are many other routes. Range is a real concern. Not for the daily trips, but for the vacations and the going home to see family trips. Many people can get away with using a second vehicle for those trips, but they don't *want* to. "
"It's already theoretically possible on a charge, you can drive slower if you want to do it in one charge.  Or you can stop at a supercharger - and yes there are two on that route - for like five or ten minutes.  Which you are likely to do anyway, because who really wants to sit for five hours without moving their limbs, eating or going to the bathroom?

Honestly, the only people who worry about stuff like this are people who don't drive EVs.  It's really not a concern to people who already do drive them.

edit: Here's a recent video by Bjorn showing a ""race"" between his Tesla and an S2000.  But the race is meant to replicate a standard 300ish mile drive - with bathroom and food stops.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlYQD9CMwUk  The idea, basically, is that this really isn't an issue."
"There were no range options on the Roadster, and I'm the second owner anyway.  They just came out with a newer, larger battery pack.  It makes the car heavier, costs too much, and adds no additional practical usefulness, as I already have more range than I need.  I would absolutely rather have less range than I currently have, if I could save on weight, which helps literally every aspect of driving dynamics, and also reduces cost, both in terms of starting cost and efficiency.  If the battery upgrade used newer cells and had the same energy storage with less weight, I would be much more likely to buy it.


If you had an 800 mile gas tank, you could skip gas stops too.  But at some point it gets ridiculous.  This is why normal cars generally have 300 mile gas tanks, and don't increase the size of their gas tank every model year.  That would be silly, and nobody needs that.  People think they need it on an EV because they've been convinced by propagandists to think that, but they don't."
"Sales figures show that there is demand for less range, as is the case with the 60"
"Okay...and the question I'm asking is: where?  That's pretty long to be considered local.  And there's charging at a whole lot of destinations.  Check www.plugshare.com, there are more chargers than you'd think, even in places you wouldn't think there are.  And not all chargers, or HV hookups, are on that website either.  Anything with an RV hookup is an EV charger, for example.

As I've said in other comments, it's possible to find a tiny corner case of an individual where this makes a difference.  But there's not much reason for the vast majority of people to get excited about this."
"> Start decreasing pack size to leaf levels and the logic breaks down quickly.

The logic breaks down?  No, because following the same logic as the question I've asked, there's an answer to ""what can you do with 300 miles that you can't do with 84.""  The answer to ""what can you do with 315 miles which you can't do with 290"" is significantly more convoluted.  ""I can drive for longer than is comfortable for normal people without stopping"" is a convoluted answer, which is why gas cars don't have endless gas tanks, even though the marginal cost of adding more gas tank capacity is significantly less.  They all hover around 300 miles, because that's more than enough - and they can't even be fueled at home."
"But why do we need that, either?  Are people excited when a new car comes out with a gas tank which is 1 gallon bigger than last year's model, or do they not worry about it?  I mean, heck, they *should* worry about it because they can't charge at home, whereas with an EV, since you can charge at home, it's less of a big deal.

What we need is expansion of a quick charging network (already in place, continually happening) and greater public knowledge about the benefits of charging at home, not infinitely-increasing battery sizes.  It just adds weight and cost, when we should be cutting down on both of those things, for better efficiency, and to better allocate the still-limited battery capacity we have, so we can ship more cars with the same amount of batteries, and take as many gas cars as possible off the road."
"> With 315 miles of range, I can drive back and forth to work Monday through Friday for 4 weeks and 1 day without recharging. With 290 miles, I'd have to charge before the month was over.

Right, so no practical change then."
"And the magic number when EVs had 100 mile range was 200, and the magic number at 200 was 300, and now the magic number is apparently 375.  That ""magic number"" still won't get you all the way from NC to MA.  And not every side route you drive on has gas, as a result, what you do is you gas up when you get to a route that has gas, the same way you would charge when you get to a route which has charge.  If you're taking side routes then you're definitely not doing the drive in a single day in which case range doesn't matter much since time isn't a factor and you'll have a full night to charge, and if you're not taking side routes and just going for speed them you can stop at the superchargers which are along the main route which is the fast route.

It won't, or at least shouldn't, get to 375.  That's an absurd amount of batteries to be carrying around all the time for no reason.  The car would be much more expensive, heavy, and less efficient, and those batteries would mostly be wasted because you could replace two or three gas cars with the same amount of batteries instead of cramming them all into one car which won't make much use of them."

"Not at all, since the extra weight also means you need more force (i.e. traction) to achieve the same acceleration. If you were to solve for maximum acceleration, the only variables that matter are the coefficient of friction (""grippiness"" of the tires) and air resistance."
"For the given weight and tire of the Model S, it would seem so. There are better tires on the market however, and other cars in its class like the Audi A7, that may use them among other things to get their stopping distance around the 100ft mark. That would put its theoretical limit around the 2.27 sec to 60. "
"According to Edmonds, yes. So some quick math, assuming deceleration is at a constant rate, 60-0 over 108 feet takes roughly 1.23 seconds. If the car can decelerate at that rate, given enough power I assume it could also accelerate at the same rate (tire traction limited).

"Damn, pro rally drivers are hard core. While I'm happy going around a course in my old stripped out subaru they are going 0-60 in 1.9 seconds in a ford. Aren't turbo-chargers a wonderful thing."
The car stops from 60 mph in under 1.3 seconds.
"Yep, we will need a 4kWh supercapacitors and a resistor bank, just in case.  Avoid overheating the battery. And when are they going to dump the silicon IGBTS and use high temperature, and smaller, SiC JFETSs."
"Maybe. These 100 kWh are on the 18650 platform.

Model 3 will be 2170, so they will be 16% taller. Some other improvements will surely be worked in as well to make it possible at some point."
"Doesn't necessarily have to be a space issue. Increased energy density could also achieve that, and the Model 3 cells will be different from the Model S cells. It's not like adding a bigger fuel tank where there is a linear, direct correlation between capacity and space required in the vehicle."
"Ya, Musk said ""we could've made car with 500 miles of range, it'd just be way too expensive"""
"To add to the energy density comment: there was a post recently on an MIT(?) breakthrough that would could double existing battery capacity for LiPo batteries. That means, if this is viable, these cars could go twice the distance for the same weight. It's speculated to be viable due to how the research was done. They worked towards existing technologies and found ways to improve it or something to that nature."
I would be willing to give up some of my frunk space.
Backseat.
Not for four or more years at least.
Capacity of the cells will only go up. There will be upgrades
Without an engine (and the parts that are needed to support it) there is a ton of space in the model 3
too many vape rigs duct taped together.
"Also, battery prices/density is improving by around 7-8% per year already, and this is on *current* tech. You add those incremental improvements + new tech + economies of scale and it isn't impossible to see a 350+ mile M3 by 2020 or even sooner."

"Yeah, but."

"Erm, nope. The packs are currently 75 90 100. 60 is software-limited pack, so it's more likely that they keep them as-is, but 90 will eventually be a software-limited 100 (assuming production costs aren't considerably different) so that they don't have to manufacture both. "
"Unlike traditional DLC, *not* unlocking it also comes with benefits = extended battery capacity"
just guessing.
Doesn't mean they couldn't do it.
"If they were able to do that with the trade off being longer operational battery life, that'd be a pretty sweet trade off for the average joe. I'm envisioning a concept similar to how current day SSDs work. They change up which parts it uses to average out wear. If you had 20kWh float worth of cells for wear smoothing, your battery could potentially last a lot longer than they are currently rated."
"Yeah I just played around on the website and it does look like a different pack, you are correct. Thanks for the info"
Yes!  This is the only thing I wanted from this announcement. 
"Me too, me too. That was the one thing I wanted to hold out for. Obviously I didn't make it, but I'm still happy with my car."
Likewise.  Still happy with mine but those premium seats in the X are comfy.

"I assume he meant over a period of owning the car, not one launch right after another."
"As far as actual performance goes it's not like the super cars are eclipsed by the Model S in anything other than 0-60. The king of hypercar Koneigsegg Regera accelerates from 90-155mph in 3.2s. Even a mainstream supercar like the McLaren 650s can go from 0-100mph in 5.8s, vs a P90DL's 7.5s, even though the 0-60 is slightly slower.

And that's not even touching things like handling, top speed, and overall track numbers.

But in the end, it doesn't make the Model S any less of a car, it's an amazing machine, just a different type of car than those other expensive toys."
People who care about 0-60 time aren't going to buy a fucking Tesla. 
"> a 2007 Tesla Roadster, a 9 year old car.

Well, that just puts it all in perspective now, doesn't it?"
"Yes, the superlative is what counts. The fastest car you can buy at any price is electric, and it can go 300 miles. 

Meatheads can stop referring to them as golf carts now."
"I'd love a faster 0-60 than a higher top speed, or faster acceleration above 60, honestly. I mean, I've avoided a few wrecks (that would have been caused by other people) by good acceleration (and some turning) alone.

I've avoided accidents in my little old Saturn, too, but none required to get up and go like the few I'd gotten away from in a friend's Camero.

Faster acceleration is just nicer for normal city/highway driving, anyway. "
"handling is way more important than 0-60 acceleration imo, and a lot of other people will say even quarter mile time is more important than just 0-60"
"Very few people can afford these cars.

"Right now, in literally 75 days that won't be true.  In 400 days doubly so.  The e6 has been in production for a while, and is $45k and 185 mile range, but not available to US non fleet users.  The 40KWh LEAF will be out in a year with a 145 mile range."
"ICE is dead in the same way Blackberry was dead or flip phones were dead before everyone had iPhones and Android devices. 

EV's are just vastly superior and the end of ICE is inevitable because of the EV. "
Really? It's temperature dependent right? 
"Also, the ones they do stop at it will charge quicker.

And also, when they drive away from a supercharger accessible area they can go further and return to supercharger safety without needing to find alternative powering options.

And it's a ""100"" which looks cooler :D"
"I didn't catch that ventilated seats are now an option. That's nice.

"> there comes a time, redditor, when the lower decimal points cease to matter, when the acceleration becomes problematic, when all other cars become uninteresting, and all that is left is a computer driving you to work.

Great intro to a dystopian sci-fi book.

"I might depending on when my number gets called for the Model 3. I'm in a lease right now til July 2018. I reserved before the announcement so I assume I'm in the first 100k orders. If the car is going to be more than a couple months too early or too late with the end of my lease I'll cancel and get a used S 60D with AP. I don't like small cars, so that's most likely what I'm gonna end up doing anyway but I wanted to have a reservation in just in case reveal 2 is something REALLY cool. But again, if 40kW brand new was an option, I'd take that. I don't need the range. "
You just paid a premium to drive a car from the future.
Eventually pretty much all owners will upgrade over time. They have a many month wait time already to get it.
"Ahh, good point.  I hadn't realized the range difference between the 90D and P90D was so large."
"In fact, I'd imagine an ICE vehicle would probably get faster as you burn through more fuel as you are reducing the overall weight of the vehicle."
"So, they perform better at higher elevations RELATIVE to internal combustion engine cars?"
"Also, with higher altitude typically comes lower temperatures, which will decrease battery performance. Not sure how much this would effect the Tesla."
"Nah, just simple trig, 1.48 G's would be the hypotenuse of 1 G (gravity) and 1.09 G (the car's acceleration). If I'm missing something let me know, it's been years since I was in a physics class. "
"If you do 2 different runs you can easily be off by a tenth of a second. 2 tenths of a second could even just be a different strip of road, different driver, different temperature outside... It's totally possible"
"Of course it was, it's just limited to 918 cars. They're even listed under ""fastest production cars by acceleration"" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fastest_production_cars_by_acceleration"
Yeah that's what confuses me too but I guess they wanted to be universal with the details... Even though MPH is often pretty universal ... Dunno  
"That's what I think too. I'd personally love to see them improve acceleration above 60mph, last time I drove a McLaren I got the ""buttefly in stomach"" feeling when I floored it at 75mph, it felt like getting rear ended by a train on the highway, would love for the Tesla to have that as well.

The Aegra can go from 90-155mph in 3.2s, can you imagine what that even feels like? 

Crazy time we live in :)"
"I can vouch for the same reaction when I stomp the thruster pedal in my 90D.

Much whee!"
"I have an older P85 and drive for Lyft, even 4 second 0-60 blows away almost everyone."
"I've never had someone experience JUST my 90D and not say ""that's the fastest acceleration ive ever felt"". There's something about the gforces that makes it feel even faster. "
"Good point! With [the rate of price decrease of battery prices][1] it will be very likely to see 100kWh standard in ~3-6 years.

"You said Model X / Model X, though. That's what he's confused about."
That's already happening.
Well it seems you did understand the distinction they were drawing after all.
"The Wh/mi could be 313,314,315,316, or 317 and it would still be under 100kWh usable while also being over 312 Wh/mi."
This is a good explanation!
"Nah, it's 0-100 km/h 😉 It's the numbers for 0-60 mi/h AND 0-100 km/h. The 60-100 mi/h times were never mentioned. You misread my comment and probably the article too."
So the 0 to 100 mph time should be something between 5.0 and 7.0 seconds. Which is crazy quick any way you cut it.
"I agree it will probably be faster, I was just playing it safe. The next 5-10 will be more about establishing electric cars(standards, factories, car designs etc) and the real growth will be the following 10 years when most if not all major car manufacturers are on board and when charging times and range are directly comparable to gas powered cars in the same price range."
"I guess I'm referring to people who like to tinker, pop the hood and show off the glistening chromed out custom intake sitting on top of a beastly V8.  For all of ICEs faults, the performance variants are almost always works of art.  There is a reason that Ferraris often have glass windows over their engines."
"But you're missing the point. The Model S is a luxury sedan which is supposed to compete with Audis. The McLaren F1 and similar cars are supercars which are built from the ground-up for speed and track racing etc.

The fact that the Model S can even compete on acceleration with the likes of McLaren, Porsche, Ferrari cars etc is fucking insane. A five-seat *sedan*!

"
"You can't go buy a Usain Bolt. Tesla even acknowledged the LaFerarri and the 918 being the fastest production cars ever, however they are no longer in production. Their point was, it's the quickest car you could go buy right now."
Not as well as an ICE but well enough for most
Okay. All the things I found about it were talking in future tense
"Those aren't customer cars yet, they're just showing them off. 

Though the very first example that was in the Geneva motorshow has been bought by some Saudi prince."
"Those are press cars.

Production is starting next month."
But you can't order one today... It's not in production.
"Chiron technically is, as 500 will be produced."
"
>Edit: I've realised the claim excludes limited production runs of the 918, LaFerrari and Chiron. 

Which would make it a false claim, unless it's talking about >500 then that makes sense"

"That's not a production car then.  To be classified as a production car, it must be mass-produced.  In fact, it doesn't even meet the FIA definition of a production car, which requires 25 copies to be produced in a 12-month period, and that's about as loose a definition you can get."
I thought they were producing 88 total.
"You can't think of an electric car like a $20k gasoline car.  The cost of charging an electric car is dirt cheap compared to gas, and there's virtually no maintenance cost.. you don't change the oil, oil filter, transmission fluid, etc.  After 5-7 years that $20k car will have cost you as much or more than a $35k Tesla.  And the Tesla is a compact luxury car with a ton of standard features you'd only get if your $20k economy car had $5k+ in upgrades.

And even if you can't afford to own a $35k Tesla Model 3, you'll be able to summon one on your phone to take you wherever you want in a few years since they'll be part of an autonomous fleet of cars."
And the P100D will very firmly be a 10 second car. 
"Yes, it is, because the model S wasn't built to be a sportscar while those were, from the ground-up. The fact that its even competing with them in the accel space is nuts."
"Cars are sold in segments. The F segment, which includes the S class, A8, 7-series, are its direct competitors. This is fact.  I'm having trouble finding your disagreement. The Model S is just an example of being able to have your cake and eat it too. Haul your entire family and haul major ass all in the same vehicle.

Why not just say that this car has impressive performance and engineering, but my needs are different and I prefer an outright supercar?"
"That's a good option, having more options is always good"
Only as long as two of those 4 people are midgets.
"I'm looking at them and they are the same old plain rear seats, I don't get it."
thannks. :D a lot more reasonable
"Thanks, :D"
"Nope, just the overheating compared to competing BMW and mercedes sedans."
"Supercars really aren't about 0-60. Until a Tesla can actually run around a racetrack without overheating, it's really not competitive at all, and it's way behind supercars in high speed acceleration (~60-130), handling, endurance at high speed, and braking. 0-60 is a fun party trick, but supercars are safe for some time to come."
"Are they? Even a mainstream McLaren 650S can get to 100mph almost 2 seconds faster than a P90DL, with top speed that's 30% faster and quite literally lap the Model S on any race track.

When talking about hypercars 0-124mph or 0-155mph is a commonly used benchmark, and to put that into perspective the Regera can accelerate from 90-150mph as fast as a P90D can go from 0-60.

ICE super cars are not fucked, but they will probably lose stoplight drag races on public streets."
Super and hypercars are using the Nurburging lap time standard; or 0-200 MPH as gauges of performance.
Christ the mindless circlejerking in this subreddit is pathetic. There is a lot more to a car's driving experience than shear acceleration. 
ICE/hybrid supercars still have the edge in literally everything besides a standing drag.
just use common sense.

It  will take awhile to put purely electric engines in performance cars considering how poorly the tesla does on a track
"You can put any sound through the speakers instead of being forced to have the usual engine sound. Yeah you won't get all of the vibration, but there are a vast dimension of incredible sounds we can't even imagine that would be an amazing replacement for the usual ICE sound."
"> Teslas are quick as a byproduct of the nature of electric motors, not as a design choice.

I wish BMW, Nissan and GM realized that with their slowish EVs. Bear in mind Elon has always been massive on fast cars (he bought a McLaren F1 when he was young). I'm sure a TON of effort went into making this 2.5s time for the latest model.

> Some new cars do that. It's relentlessly mocked in car mags.

I'm guessing that's when they try to imitate the traditional engine sound, when there's a whole new dimension of sounds that they could explore instead, for example a more jet-engine or bullet/maglev train type sound.

I'm sure traditional engine sounds can be cool when they're not annoying the neighbourhood around you late at night. I think of the Tesla more of a stealth ninja that doesn't need to 'advertise' its presence to still be a powerhouse."

"Dude, that's so incredibly fast. I used to have a 2006 GSXR1000, which has the fastest 0-60 time of any production motorcycle at 2.35 seconds. I probably never even accelerated at that rate, considering how much rider skill is involved in 0-60 times. I can't imagine just flooring it in a 4 door sedan and beating a 1000cc sportbike. When I was on my bike I could put ANY car to shame. 

I live in the same area as Sir-Mix-A-Lot and when I had my bike I ran into him quite a few times on the local road where everyone goes to do some spirited driving. I got into it with him in his R8 twice, his red ferarri once, and his orange lambo 3 times. Fucking smoked him every time. "

Let me say from all those who can only afford a model 3 and even then just barely. Thanks for using your money to help finance our future cars!
"Pay $845,000 for a 2 seater because acceleration! speed!

Or, pay $700,000 less for a 7 seater with equivalent acceleration... and yes, less speed.

I have to accelerate from a full stop 20 times every day, and for $700,000 less I can hold 5 more people, and kick the crap out of a hyper-car at a stop light.

I literally never go over 90 mph (and, really, who does?), but I can TOTALLY pay $700,000 extra to increase my max speed from 155mph to 210 mph... while carrying (showing off for?) 5 LESS people.

It's like, damnit, the cost comparison relative to the features that actually matter is stupid simple!

Plus you get to genuinely, truly invest in a renewable future in the most impactful way possible while owning a family sedan that matches a 2-seater hyper-car.

I would stretch myself to fund that purchase simply because it is one of very few ""this will genuinely matter"" purchases I can make in my life.

Alas, I own a used Volt because it is the most I can do. I love my Volt, but, crap, it doesn't seat 7, and beat a 2 seater hyper-car."

"I doubt they'll sell you the 100kWh battery for the 3 right away.  It's still a $20,000 battery and the weight will decrease efficiency enough that it's not a true linear upgrade in range."
Linear extrapolation->(100 kwh / 55 kwh) * 215 miles = 390 miles
"I did the math: (60/55) x (315 x 100/90) = 374

How are you getting 390?"
"Let me try to explain. The car is made of aluminum. It's got a barebones interior and a hollow trunk and frunk. It has Recaro seats and very little sound insulation (due to no engine). This car is really, really, stripped down from a weight perspective, especially compared to the opulence of its competitors (BMW 7 series, Mercedes S class, Audi A8, etc).

That being said, the battery adds most of the weight to this car, but since it's all low in the floor, it doesn't matter as much. The only significant way to lighten a Model S is to make the battery smaller, which defeats the point of what you're trying to accomplish (more range). Elon noted when the Model S was launched, that Tesla found the sweet spot between size, weight and range. Most people would agree."
"I'm sorry, Instant  pervasive infrastructure you say? With no extra cost?

I'll just have a word with the business fairy."
"In the US, many families are spread out over mountain passes. In WA state and BC, there are four practical routes east to west, only one has a charge station. In the winter one of those passes closes completely and the other two close periodically due to weather.

There is also the factor of waiting for a charge on the long drives. If you have to leave on a Friday night in order to get a full day on Sunday before driving home to get back to work, the wait time matters. If you have a six hour drive, and are dodging traffic, it is nice to be able to keep driving.

Not everyone has these needs it's true, but many people do.

Edit: clarity"
"""Honestly, the only people who worry about stuff like this are people who don't drive EVs.""

... which are exactly the people that Tesla is trying to convince to switch."
"> you can drive slower if you want to do it in one charge

Yeah...as someone who *does* drive an EV...no thanks.  The whole point of Tesla as a company is that they're trying to show the world that it's possible to make vehicles that require as little compromise as possible in order to perform the same duties as a standard ICE vehicle.

I'm currently willing to make two supercharger stops on a trip from SF->LA.  I'm not willing to *also* slow down to 60 or 50mph to eliminate one supercharger stop, and these kind of incremental pushes in range are minimizing if not eliminating the need to do so."
"Well, yes, I know that there are Superchargers. You asked who might care about this range increase and I forwarded a hypothetical. Tesla is trying to sell cars, so anything they can do to assuage the concerns, rational or not, of potential customers is an advantage for them."
">If you had an 800 mile gas tank, 

I have one on a truck, 32 gallons. I have to stop at a gas station about once a month, it is amazing.
"
"> I already have more range than I need

You seem to be assuming the rest of the world has your driving profile and preferences.  You use your Roadster pretty much only for local travel, I take it?  For anyone who does only local driving with their EV, everything you're saying makes a lot more sense.  The moment there's a possibility of driving beyond even half of your range on a regular basis, that capacity becomes a lot more important.  Many people can't afford a second car and don't want to rent one or use other options for long distance travel, so that capacity is important to them.

> But at some point it gets ridiculous.

That point is certainly not 257 miles (in my case, for my conditions).

> This is why normal cars generally have 300 mile gas tanks

Well, it's *also* because there are many thousands of gas stations where those cars can refill in 5 minutes or less, which EVs for the most part do not have (and really so far Tesla supercharging is almost the only EV charging option that is even moderately practical for long distance travel)."
"Sales figures *also* show that there is demand for more range, as is the case with the 90D."
"It is NOT a tiny corner case. I don't have a Tesla yet, but I always check the supercharger map and plugshare to plan my trips as if I had a Tesla to see what I would have to do. My day-trip this past weekend was 155 miles one-way (speed limit 55mph so a 90D could probably make it round trip). Yes, the city I visited did have several public chargers on plugshare, but I'd have to park there and hire a Uber to get to my destination and then back to my car. "
"I've seen you mention the ""300 mile"" range of ICE vehicles several times in this thread. You're way off, FANGO. Take for instance a Honda accord. It has a 17.1 gallon fuel tank. Its average miles per gallon is 32. That puts the car at 547 miles on a single tank. The hybrids do even better than that. 

Edit: Gallons for liters."
"I agree that improving the infrastructure for rapid charging or battery swapping is more important than battery capacity. But it's also important that cars can still handle long trips. My Honda Civic can go 450 miles, which is nice to have on long trips. I only have to fill up once to make it to my relatives 9 hours away.

On further consideration, lack of charging infrastructure makes range even more important for EV's than it is for ICE's."
"Let's not pretend there aren't more fueling stations for ICE vehicles here. How prevalent is it to travel along the east coast for 20-30 miles without being in the range of a fueling station. 

Their current battery technology is the limited factor for greater range with the same battery size, as told by Elon himself. They're working on this with Panasonic.  Once they increase the efficiency of their batteries they won't have to increase the size of the packs. Your argument is the inefficiency of an increased size, that's not where they're headed.  

The issue is my own comfort. They make bigger gas tanks for a reason. "
And those cost something like $40k a set.
Holy crap that's incredible. 
Wow I chuckled 
Electric remote control cars do the same thing and still shred tires regardless
"it's not for the acceleration, it's for the top speed. Because, the car is 'pushing' a ton of air per second when going almost 300mph, the engine has to translate that force to the tires. So the ripping forces between rim and tire are greatest at top speed than at acceleration because the engine is also reeving higher so it's able to output more power, more force to the tires. "
https://gfycat.com/HoarseSociableAngora
I was hoping the tires would be ripped to shreds...
Well in drag racing we have VHT and PJ1. A glued surface for cars with 3000 horsepower have liners or beadlocks to prevent slicks from ripping away on the rim. Standard street tires should get some sort of special model to avoid sidewall leaks or rips. I know where you're coming from
"Or the complete opposite and they rip the lugnuts off :) My personal car many moons ago. The stock studs did not agree with a 5500rpm 2-step launch

That's ludicrous 
Yikes!  Did they recommend a tire upgrade prior to using your new launching superpowers?

"Your response is basically correct, but can't downward force that isn't based on mass (e.g. from a airfoil on the vehicle that produces downwards force) also help?  There's a trade-off there with air resistance, but it can be a third factor, I think."
"This is not correct. Go draw me a static free body diagram of all the forces applied to a 35lb wheel and tire with a 1100lb vertical load at .01mph and 800lb/ft of torque. Assume the cf of the road surface and tire are just enough to cause no slippage. Now go back and put a vertical load of 600lb on the same diagram. The cf assumed earlier will no longer be sufficient and the wheel will spin unless power applied is reduced. 

Now you have another equation to work through. At what point does reducing vehicle mass and vertical load while reducing power cause a loss of acceleration. F=MA and all that. Power, weight, traction and acceleration are all related. "
"That was a rather pompous response. The coefficient of friction of the tires is heavily dependent on the weight of the car, so under the right conditions more weight does mean more traction and faster acceleration....and you can't effectively use a spoiler at those speeds."
"You mathed wrong.

108 feet at 60mph does indeed only take 1.23 seconds, but if you cover 108 feet while stopping from 60mph, your average speed will not be 60mph. If we assume a constant rate of deceleration (which basically means we're ignoring air drag), the average speed will be half the initial speed, so the average speed will be 30mph. This means the overall stop will take 2.45 seconds, showing how close the car already is to a traction limited 0-60 acceleration."
[deleted]
That's literally 2.2 Gs of acceleration!
Because it isn't the weight of a full size pickup
Car and driver tested the last model at 2.5s
Porsche is known to underrate
Just one oil change on Bugatti Veryon probably would bankrupt lots of people.
I stand corrected. 
Top speed is meaningless though. Unless you're into drag racing or some such.
"Completely true, but also rather meaningless for anything but a drag strip.

Obviously at 2.5 0-60 you're going faster than reasonable on a road anyway, but it's at least normal road speeds. Having a faster 60-100 or 100+ speeds is meaningless if you're driving halfway legally."
"Yeah, but. So what? If you want to compare other variables, let's compare number of seats or cargo capacity or auto steer capabilities where the Model S obliterates the Veyron."
1. Quick 2. Beautiful 3. Electric. Before the Telsa I had to compromise on the electric part

"Huge wings you say?  Like one on each side that can be raised and lowered, almost at the push of a button?  It's all becoming clear ..."
"A wing only functions as air passes over it, and there's much less air passing over it when traction matters for a 0-60 time than above 60. 

At that stage you're only using the wing for downforce to give traction when turning, but drag squares with speed so you'll be killing the efficiency, which obviously no one wants."
"I think the advantage with these EV's is their low, even weight distribution—mostly in the battery under the floor."
That is not how acceleration works.

Also faster supercharging.
"Isn't that exactly what we're talking about though? They're restricting the full use of the battery, keeping 10kwh in a locked box that can't be used without paying. That's not a benefit "
"Ohhh, OK. Me, too. Who knows?"
"I know. But, I'm trying to elucidate what they did say, haha."
"Exactly! Wear leveling (or smoothing) and overprovisioning! That would be super interesting.

"What you can do on the road with friends in the car and people around is all that matters to many people buying these cars. Being in an insanely fast car is fun. Very few people take their hyper cars to the track and push them to the limits. Most people I know who have hyper cars have them for show and have never pushed them in any real sense. Those who are serious own race cars and the really wealthy ones race Daytona Prototypes and Grand Am cars for kicks. They pay to have ""Pro racers"" on their team in races. Having a fast car on the road is just fashion for them."
"""people who care about  0-60 times aren't going to care about the car with the fastest 0-60 time of any productoin car in the world"""
Then no Tesla owner would spend $50 in performance upgrades to improve 0-60 times.
"> Meatheads can stop referring to them as golf carts now.

Lol... like this will stop them."
"Not ""fastest"". Fastest time to 60mph, yes. But not fastest top speed, not fastest quarter mile, not fastest to 100mph, etc."
You mean the fastest car 0-60 (which is mostly what people use when driving) you can buy
But the tech idiots who read only /r/futurology never realize that the headlines are never correct. The amount of ignorance is pretty amazing. 
" ""The fastest car you can buy at any price is electric"" is pure nonsense. It has the fastest *Production* 0-60. Any meathead can get their s-10 to do that for 15k. It does not have the fastest top speed, nor the prestige and track ability of many cars that are much cheaper than it too."
There's people who call a tesla a golf cart?
Agreed! I thought most people had this mindset. I've never heard of these consumer trends where people don't care about acceleration!
"Yeah, handling makes or breaks a car, I agree. But, I don't think ""almost no automobile consumers give a damn about 60 time.""

But, in normal day to day driving....I think acceleration is more important than the top speed it can eke out in a quarter-mile. "
"No, I agree with your statement. But....what does that have to do with ""average"" consumers preferring a 5s 0-60 car versus a 10s 0-60 car? 

The original comment makes it sound like nobody cares about acceleration, which I find very hard to believe."

"Not exactly for your first point. Ariel Atom is dead on reliable since it uses a Honda engine. Just, doesn't have all the creature comforts of the Model S. Also, while that may be true, the problem about single speed electric cars is they die out up at higher speeds. I bet a BMW 340i would give a P100d a run for its money 70-110."
"Except iPhone and Android came with better functionality at a comparable or less price point when compared to the Blackberry.

This is just not true for EV yet. Show me an EV that's superior to a Honda Accord that sells for $25k.

Your statement is ok if it's predictive, but don't make it sound descriptive."
The Tesla owner motto
"I wonder if the 100D gets faster than the 90D ... I doubt it, but it's worth hoping for. 3.9, just to say ""in the 3's"" would be sweet. "
"Good question, I haven't seen a run before at a high altitude location like Denver. It'll be interesting to see if they perform better than at sea level or as chriskmee pointed out whether the typically cooler temperatures have any impact."
"Same here!  I think I will upgrade my P90D if they drop the price on the ludicrous upgrade like they did on the P85D a while ago.  Heard it improves the acceleration beyond 30mph or so, but I'll tell ya...even on lower models, I still get excited.  

I had a loaner P90 the other day.  Was entering a highway, accelerated and was surprised how it felt.  I think it's 70% excitement from instant torque (regardless of model), and 30% excitement from the speed.  That instant torque is game-breaking and why I'll never buy a ICE again.

It's also why I think the average person can't tell the difference between 3.2 and 2.5 and 2.7.  The instant torque though; that is absolutely noticeable."
"It will be a good while before electrics can make speeds over 60mph. 

They are great for stop and go, but just can't get up there quickly at track speeds. 

Hopefully Tesla figures out how to let them run full power for more than 5 minutes. It seems the larger the battery pack, the more time you can spend under load. Perhaps a big 200kwh with great cooling could keep this thing on the track for a full race."
"Oh, yeah, typo. Just throwing up a ? Didn't really tell me much. ;)"
Jesus Christ is everybody in this sub this snarky?
"I didn't misread anything. I'm saying 0.2s from 60mph to 62mph makes sense, you see that kind of gap a lot with other supercars as well. There is nothing wrong with the measurement like you suggested.

I'm only giving you an example of 60-100mph to illustrate the point that acceleration slows down a lot as speed goes up."

"That's not what ""quickest production car"" means, at least for e.g. the Guinness book records. They consider all cars which are or *were* in production at some point and sold more than 25 vehicles. For example, the McLaren F1 was officially the fastest (top speed) production car until 2005, even though McLaren stopped production in 1999. Also, ""limited run"" does not matter, as long as at least 25 cars were sold. So both the Porsche 918 and the LaFerrari officially are quicker cars, and the (currently still in production) Porsche 911 Turbo S is just as quick (2.5s measured real world performance) as the Tesla."
You can still go and buy a LaFerrari or 918 (if someone is selling one) it's just not factory new. Whether a car is in production or not is a pointlessly arbitrary piece of info when comparing performance.
"""Currently produced"" is different than ""production car"".  The S might top the former with a verified time, it most definitely does not top the latter "
I've realised the claim excludes vehicles with limited production. 
Much appreciated!!

"You might be right. I can't seem to find where they said they would be producing 8. I've been following them for a while now, and I thought at some point I heard they would only be producing 8, might have miss heard. All I can find is 88."
"Uber is only in two cities in my state; I know what you mean about operating costs though. Regardless, Tesla will need to produce a 20k$ car to reach the masses"
"I agree that it's an amazing feat of engineering, but why can't Tesla just admit that there ARE cars quicker than it? Why do they have to lie? It's still impressive even when you hear the truth."

My best friend had to take a loss and get rid of his lease because it could not make Fresno to Carmel in his P85D. We all loved the car especially him.

"Passes close for gas cars as well.

The difference between 290 and 315 miles is four minutes worth of supercharging.  Gasoline powered vehicles typically have a tank which holds about 300 miles worth of gasoline.

You still have not told me what specifically you can do in 315 miles which you can't do in 290."
"I live in a small town, with no roads out of town. I bought an electric car with a 70 mile range, and people are often AGHAST... 

Then I ask them the last time they've driven 70 miles in a day, and nobody ever has. It's ridiculous. 

There's literally nowhere I can drive in town without being able to get back home in a single charge. I could drive to the airport and back three times, to a supermarket half a dozen times...

It takes some serious convincing that it's not too hard to plug in a car at night. And THEN, people assume it costs more than gas. I don't get it. Intelligent people still ask questions like ""what does that do to your electric bill? Extra hundred or two a month?"" 

It's like $10."
"And yet, if they listened to the experiences of people who actually have experience driving EVs, instead of the experience of those who do not drive EVs, they would know that this is not an issue.  That's the craziest thing about it, I'll have people who have never driven an EV tell me what it's like to own one, as if they have more experience in the subject than someone who has driven them for 7 years, and who has also driven a gas car.  You would think that someone with comparative experience of the two methods would be able to tell the differences better than someone who doesn't have said experience.

And the question still remains, what can you do in 315 that you can't do in 290?"
"Not to mention every time you skip a Supercharger stop, that's a free spot for the growing fleet of Teslas."
"He was talking about ""theoretical possibilities,"" I told him that it is currently also ""theoretically possible"" to do the same, but that that doesn't matter, because there are two superchargers there and you need a total of maybe five or ten minutes worth of stopping time, which you are likely to want to do on that trip anyway."
"But in the case of that hypothetical, the difference in range doesn't matter.  That's why I'm asking for a real situation where people might need this 25 mile increase.  I cannot think of any concerns which would be assuaged by this, except for people who just want to see numbers changing.  If anything, I could make an argument that this *increases* people's concerns, since it gives the false impression that EVs don't currently have enough range to be suitable, and that they need to continually gain more range, and that people should delay their buying decisions until EV range is ""enough"" - even though it already is."
"Right, so with an EV, you would have to charge once every couple weeks, which you can do at home without going anywhere.  This is what I'm saying - the difference between charging once every 13 days and once every 14 days is insignificant, especially since charging happens at home and takes no more effort than moving your arm a few feet from the wall to the charge port on the car."
">You seem to be assuming the rest of the world has your driving profile and preferences. 

Ah, so first you ask me what matters to me in my own situation, and then you tell me that I'm projecting my situation onto everyone else.  No, that's not what I'm doing, and in fact that's what *you're* doing with that answer.  I've asked several times for a situation where there's a big difference between 315 and 290 miles, and I'm not getting any specific answers.  Meanwhile, the vast majority of cars don't drive long distances in a single day.  So if you'd stop assuming the rest of the world has your driving profile and preferences, that would be nice.

Further, there have been at least two people who have driven a Tesla Roadster around the entire world.  One of them was four years ago, one of them is finishing sometime this week.  The one four years ago was racing a Citroen C-Zero, which has 70-some miles of range and no quick charging capability.  It also made it around the world.

>Many people can't afford a second car and don't want to rent one or use other options for long distance travel, so that capacity is important to them.

Are those the people paying 20 grand for 25 miles of extra battery capacity?  That rents a lot of cars and buys a lot of plane tickets, you know.

>Well, it's also because there are many thousands of gas stations where those cars can refill in 5 minutes or less, which EVs for the most part do not have

Right, EVs have millions of gas stations where they can refill in 5 seconds or less.  It's at your house, where you can plug it in every night, without having to go out of your way to get to a gas station.  Gas cars need large tanks because people don't want to start and end every day at a gas station, but people are happy to start and end each day at home.  And yet despite that handicap, they still don't have endlessly-large tanks, because that would be silly."
"What isn't a tiny corner case?  People who make 150 mile local trips?  Yeah, that's a tiny corner case.  There are very few people who do that.  Maybe you're generalizing your situation to everyone else, but that's extremely rare.

Anyway, the question I asked, again, was: where?  People have driven around the world in short-range EVs without quick charge capability, electricity is everywhere, high voltage plugs are as well.  They're not all marked on plugshare either.  And most cars do very low daily mileage.  Certainly not enough to justify the additional cost for 25 miles extra range, the five digit cost of which can hire a lot of ubers."
"> It has a 17.1 liter fuel tank. Its average miles per gallon is 32.

You might want to work on your units, there.

A BMW 5 series or 7 series - you know, cars someone might actually cross-shop with a large luxury performance sedan - have tanks around 18 gallons and mpg in the low 20s, giving them ranges in the 300s.  Jaguar F type is the same ballpark.  Mercedes S class is the same ballpark.  Basically, everything in that class is the same ballpark.  And none of them can be charged at home, which is quite inconvenient.

They could easily add more capacity by making the tanks bigger, but they don't, because that would be silly.  Silly, exactly.

You're way off, Joshua--."
"You are currently closer to a place to charge an EV than you are to a place to fill a gas tank.  Electricity is everywhere.  If you're traveling along the east coast, you are probably not more than 20-30 miles from a charge station either, not even counting typical or high voltage outlets.  Go to plugshare.com, there are tens of thousands of stations there.

A larger battery is always going to be a larger size than a smaller battery.  What is needed are lighter batteries, not longer range ones.  If you make the cells more energy dense, then you can remove cells, rather than adding more range.

They don't make bigger gas tanks, in fact.  They make cars all with about the same size gas tank - about 300 miles, give or take.  There aren't any special options to get larger gas tanks, because that would be silly and unnecessary - even though gasoline is a less convenient fuel than electricity, because you can't fill your car with gas at home, but you can fill it with electricity.  If you're looking for comfort, you should get an EV, as it is an infinitely more comfortable situation than driving on gas.  You will understand that once you try it, as nearly all EV owners have."
"I think it's $30k a set, plus $120k for rims every fourth tire change."
"> it's not for the acceleration, it's for the top speed. Because, the car is 'pushing' a ton of air per second when going almost 300mph, the engine has to translate that force to the tires. So the ripping forces between rim and tire are greatest at top speed than at acceleration because the engine is also reeving higher so it's able to output more power, more force to the tires. 

"
One might even say it's...ludicrous. 
"I mean, the car is ridiculous. Early on they had to modify it because the engine would torque the driveshaft in half if someone slammed on the gas "
"The acceleration from standstill did still require a lot of technical innovation, particularly the gearbox. Of course, the Teslas don't have that problem to deal with."

"There is no higher tire, they are Y (101) rated. It was just a manufacturing defect most likely that didn't get triggered until I could launch at 0-60 in 2.6 sec."
[deleted]
Most certainly (although I suspect it would have a negative effect on acceleration at 0-60 speeds). I'm guessing the equation he's using for max acceleration is a simplified textbook example that doesn't account for these factors. 
"Mostly, yes, but at higher speeds the motor will no longer be putting out the full force it was capable of at 0 mph. This means that, while a down force *would* allow for more traction independent of mass, the motor wouldn't be able to take advantage of that extra traction unless the motor was running at considerably under 100% during 0-10 mph. "
"> At what point does reducing vehicle mass and vertical load while reducing power cause a loss of acceleration.

Never. I'm not wrong, you just don't understand my point. Fine, let's work through the physics:

What's the acceleration of a body? F=MA, as you said. Force = mass * acceleration. If we solve for acceleration we find that 

> **acceleration = force / mass.**

So to find the acceleration of a body of known mass we need to find the force applied. The maximum force that can be applied by the wheels can be found by the maximum static friction value between the wheels and the road. Static friction between two bodies is their coefficient of friction (it's supposed to be a mu but I'll use your 'cF') times the normal force. Normal force is gravity * mass, so

> **Fs = cF * g * mass**
 
So if we plug that in for force into a = f/m, we find that 

> **acceleration = (cF * g * mass)/mass**

But OH! Look! Mass is on the top and bottom of the fraction. That means it **cancels out**. So at the end we have

> **acceleration = cF * g**

Mass is irrelevant to the maximum acceleration of a car through road friction since acceleration is inversely proportional to mass and static friction is proportional. Ergo, they cancel each other out."
"The coefficient of friction of the tires is dependent on nothing but the material properties of the road and tires. For example, the coefficient of friction of a [car tire on asphalt is 0.72](http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/friction-coefficients-d_778.html). Obviously, that is for average asphalt and tires since their material properties vary and temperature might play a role, but that number isn't dependent upon how much force is applied to the two.

The only thing I could think of additional mechanical friction from further pressing the rubber into the rough surface of the asphalt, but given that tire pressure, material, road surface, initial mass, tire surface area, tire wall thickness, and temperature all factor into how much deeper a tire will sink with an extra kilogram added, you can't make a simple correlation of more mass *always* grants you more force than the mass takes to accelerate."
Thank you. So the model S has reached its limit of traction from 0-60mph. Next would be bringing the same acceleration to 60-100 and beyond. 
"I is not good at math.

An average of 30mph over the distance traveled makes a lot of sense. I think you are right, 2.45 would be the theoretical limit for the Model S. The best braking sports cars out today can stop in 90 feet from 60, so a new Roadster could get into the 2.0 range to 60. "
"i'd hazard a guess that it is already traction limited

electric motors are *powerful* "
"This also shows that my Mazda's 7.6s time is too slow to reach 60mph before the p100d can reach 60, stop and then do it again."
"Not to be a douche but ice engine is a redundancy, you're saying internal combustion engine engine"
Thats cool on their part. 
Which in no way diminishes it's top speed. That has nothing to do with anything. 
"And those people would never afford a Veyron in the first place either, to be blunt. "
"No, saying a car is fast means it has a high top speed, and saying it's quick means it accelerates quickly. Therefore the Tesla is not as fast as the Veryon, but it is as quick as the Veryon, which was my point. "
This just in: Tesla merges with SpaceX. Model X to be renamed Model SpaceX
"True, but then how do top-fuel dragsters launch so quickly? They have huge wings, but I guess the wings are used for high-speed stability, and the sticky wheels may help them launch."
But it helps ur mom
"Luckily, you don't have to guess. The dimensions are in the name. 21-70. 21mm diameter, 70mm long."
That'd kill the handling and definitely ruin crash test rating.

But it's not like he's going ""oh well I'm shutting down my company now because the Model S goes 0-60 in 2.5s"". 

Of course EV is better than ICE in anything but track-racing supercars. The only big downside right now is charging convenience for many people and cost, but both of those will improve in the future. "

"For road travel in the US there is virtually no need, even on the higher speed limit roads in Germany it's not a huge factor."
"People who care about 0-60 also care about handling, and how well the car actually races. 

Good luck tracking a Tesla. "
It also doesn't help most meatheads are aware you can spend half what a Tesla costs into a stock car and up with something that will beat a tesla in a 1/4. 
It's because it is a stupid thing to say. People care about the feeling quick acceleration gives and others care about having the quickest luxury car money can buy.
"Plenty of people do think that quarter mile times are more important. Also when you're on the highway, 0-60 really doesn't matter since you're already going over 60. Really I think 40-100 acceleration is more important than 0-60, and that's better represented by quarter mile times. 0-60 is too dominated by the launch.

But for sure handling is more important, and driving feel and driver involvement are even more important than that."

Edit: there is no other electric car on the market that A) can go that far, and B) is that fast off the line. Bigger and better doesn't not mean cheaper. I'm very excited what this mean for the performance of future electric cars as this will trickle down to cheaper products."

"My point is that there *aren't* superchargers on the mountain passes at all. There are no towns or infrastructure for long distances, and stopping to charge is not possible. I imagine a lot of country roads are the same.

25 miles is significant. If HWY20 closes, it can add sixty miles to the trip along another route with no superchargers. Going to 90 adds even more distance and if you are headed north means detouring to Ellensburg. 

My point is that avoiding major detours saves a ton of time (literally hours).

There is a use case for long range EVs"
"Exactly.

Notice where the pushback is coming for all this?  It's from people who don't drive EVs.  People who drive EVs understand it completely.  It's really not an issue."
You can drive an extra 25 miles. It's that simple. It is an issue. I live in Wyoming and definitely won't consider an EV if the range isn't improving. 
"You asked for an example, and he gave an example.  ""Drive more slowly"" is not an acceptable answer to *most* people, who prefer to spend their time at their destinations rather than en route.

Five or ten minutes of stopping time is not even close to enough for an SF to LA run even starting with a full charge - typically it's at *least* a half hour, and you need even more if the place you're headed to doesn't happen to have a destination charging option...and that's if the supercharger station you're stopping at isn't full when you happen to get there.  Meanwhile, in an ICE one fifteen minute stop for a six hour trip had previously been plenty for both the vehicle and the humans inside it.

The bottom line is that more range gives you more options and flexibility.  Can people ""theoretically"" get by without it?  Yes, if they spend extra time planning and extra time traveling...but they don't have to spend that extra time if they have the range."

Huh? Power output of the motor is dependent upon it's own speed (RPM) - in fact in the normal case car engines output LESS power at 0-10 mph; they haven't yet reached the engine speed at which they produce the most power.

F = µN. You don't necessarily need the downforce (N) if the tire is sticky enough (µ).
They are hitting speeds you could only do in a tesla if you strapped it to a spacex flight. 
"While the sticky tires, which are tremendously large and have very large footprints, help - they are only a small part of the equation. The real secret is the clutch. It acts as a transmission and traction control/power delivery device. With over 10,000hp and more torque than can be measured, you don't actually want all of that power when you're at 0mph and only have a little bit of vertical loading on the tires. So, the clutch slips a lot during the first bit and locks up only after the car is moving so you already have forward momentum and a giant amount of downforce from the wing. If you watch them race you will sometimes see them launch cleanly and then blow the tires away 300' down the track. That's from having ""too aggresive"" of a tune in the clutch for track conditons. The art and science of top fuel and funny car clutches is the closest kept secret in drag racing. "
Hmm. TIL.
"Maybe, maybe not.  A 30 kwh battery in the front would weigh about as much as a combustion engine so handling would be affected but still fairly good.  It would make crumple zones more complex, but again only as bad as a normal car and crash protection over the rest of the car would probably be better.  The battery would be mounted to the front of the car, and in a crash the battery would move back towards the firewall while the frame/body around it crumple.  In slow crashes it would be just as safe as normal, although high speed/hard impacts would be just as risky as an ICE car.  Those crashes will have the risk of accidents like one my mom once had- the engine block came through the dashboard and nearly in her lap (she was fine).

All of that assumes the batteries can't just be fit on the bottom of the car, which I think is an unreasonable assumption."

">I don't think you know how electric torque works.

I don't think *you* do. Electric motors create peak torque at 0 RPM. Not up high in the rev range.

[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/r73Dbe3.png) the dyno curve of a Tesla Model S P85D. You see that white line? That's the P85D torque. You also see how it rapidly goes downward after 40mph? That's a dropoff.

>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMRURBQ49XQ 

Neat. it's a video of a 3 year old Mustang doing a 0 to whatever pull.

Which has exactly nothing to do with what I was talking about.

I said: 

>Once you're at 60mph or above you've lost all your pulling power due to the electric torque dropoff and a base V8 Mustang is going to walk away

So first off we assume both vehicles start the drag race at 60mph.

A 2016 Ford Mustang GT, with a 5.0L V8, is making 400lb\*ft of torque.

A 2016 Tesla Model S P90D, with quad electric motors, is making 60% of it's available power (started at 713lb\*ft) according to the before mentioned dyno (And it doesn't have any gears to compensate) is now making a whopping 420lb\*ft of of torque (adjusted from the P85D's numbers).

So both cars are at 60mph, both are making about the same torque, with the Model S barely making more.

At 70mph, the Ford Mustang is still capable of making 400lb\*ft

At the same time, the P90D's torque has now dropped to 392lb\*ft

The Ford Mustang, which is 900lb *lighter* than the SUV-heavy Model S, is more than capable of walking away from the Model S on the highway.

****

Nobody is arguing the Mustang can take on the Model S from a stop.

A highway pull, on the other hand, is a totally different story. 
"
"I don't quite think you realise how dramatic the torque falloff is.

While it's the P85D and not the P90D, this [torque curve](http://i.imgur.com/r73Dbe3.png) (We'll ignore the numbers since it's the 85D and not the 90D and work off percentages) shows that at 60mph your torque is down to about ~60% of peak and by 80mph you're making as little as ~45% the amount you started with.

Assuming the P90D's torque follows roughly the same curve, and I don't see any reason it shouldn't, you're down to 420lb\*ft, just ahead of the Mustang's 5.0L V8 output of 400lb\*ft. If you're going slightly faster at 70mph the Mustang is making 8lb\*ft *more* torque than you are.

And your car is a solid 900lb heavier than the Mustang.

So not only are you making only marginally more power at 60mph, the Mustang is far lighter and requires a lot less energy to get moving. 

And that's just the Mustang, at 60mph you might as well be sitting still if you're up against one of the Hellcat twins."
">I think you need to go test drive one of these things.  
>High speed corners are solid

Mate the Model S hits the skidpan at 0.91g. While pretty good in terms of, say, a crossover or a standard family sedan (My car, with wider tires than stock, will pull about a g), the Mclaren P1 can sustain 1.8g and can peak at 2.6g in a corner.

Like, they're not even in the same zip code let alone ballpark when it comes to cornering performance.

>no other 700 hp car that I know of can take a turn from a stop with the throttle mashed.

The key is not slowing down through the corner, not accerating through it.

It doesn't mean jack if you car can accelerate to 60mph quickly if it has to slow down far more for a corner than the rest of the competition does.

"
"Yes, it's messy. This equation doesn't take into account *actual usable KWH* of the packs, nor the effect of weight."
"I'm not sure.   The car feels like I have to work it in a slalom type driving like if I go right it wants to sit there before going back left.   My last suv Mercedes ml63 was a little more aggressive..   My wife's Macan S is not as quick as either,  but the steering and handling is far more connected to the road..."
"You just said that one of them has a supercharger.  If there are no towns or infrastructure, then how are you stopping for gas in a place that doesn't have gas?"
"So, will you put off your purchase decision until next model year of whatever gas car you're thinking of buying, and only buy it if the gas tank is getting larger?  Cause you know, with a larger gas tank, you can drive more miles, it's that simple."
">""Drive more slowly"" is not an acceptable answer to most people, who prefer to spend their time at their destinations rather than en route.

Good thing that *wasn't the answer*, please read both comments again.  There are two superchargers on the route.  I've said that twice.  Please read comments before responding to them.

>typically it's at least a half hour...Meanwhile, in an ICE one fifteen minute stop for a six hour trip had previously been plenty for both the vehicle and the humans inside it.

So you're saying that, if you stop for more time than you need to in an EV (30 minutes = 170 miles of range, which is way more than enough to get you 380 miles in a Tesla), and you stop for the minimum possible amount of time in a gas car (time your stops, 15 minutes is quite fast), then you can save fifteen whole minutes in a six hour trip?  But wait, if you paid 20 grand for the larger battery, you could save another four minutes with the Tesla?  In that six hour trip.  Seems cost-effective.

This is not an answer to what you can do with 315 which you can't do with 290."
">That's why I'm asking for a real situation where people might need this 25 mile increase.

Exactly, no answer, which was my point to begin with.  When you get your Model 3, you'll learn."
">No. I asked specifically because it sounded like you were generalizing your own needs and attitudes to the rest of the world, and that's exactly what you're doing.

No, it's what you're doing, by thinking that everybody drives inbetween 290 and 315 miles every day in regions where there is no electricity except at their home.  So wait, I guess you're not even generalizing your own situation, you're just living in a fantasy world.

Oh, well, positively cheap then.  I'll take three!

> If you can explain to me how I can charge my EV at home while I'm on a long distance trip, you should give Musk a call because he may have a job for you.

I can definitely do that.  First of all, I will explain to you that I was talking about all charging, the majority of which happens at home.  This is evident if you bothered to read the comments you're responding to, which is something you clearly have difficulty with.  Second, there are superchargers for long trips, which is something you also have difficulty with understanding, since I mentioned it a few times and you thought I didn't.  Third, there is destination charging.  Fourth, the more people who have EVs, the more homes you can charge at, such that if your destination is a home, then you can charge at that person's home.  Which you can already do at any place with electricity, particularly if they have an HV plug, which many homes do, even if they don't have an EV charging station.

All this adds up to there being no significant difference between 315 and 290 miles, which is the question I've asked repeatedly and you've refused to answer.  Probably because you have difficulty reading, as has become evident.

>And you were just saying they don't. I think you're confused.

No, in fact, I wasn't saying that.  I think you're confused.  In fact, I *know* you're confused, because you're having a real difficult time understanding comments which aren't hard to understand.  So I'm not going to bother trying to get any information to you anymore, since you don't seem interested in receiving it.  Good day."
"A weekend trip which is 150 miles in each direction?  And you're saying you don't think you could do that with 290 miles?  You could do that with 160 miles, without stopping in either direction.  A 12v plug can provide you with enough electricity to charge you up in the two days you're at your destination.  And you are always closer to a 12v plug than you are to a gas pump - because gas stations all have electricity, and so does everywhere else.

Same goes if it's only a day trip.  The difference between 290 and 315 miles is 4 minutes of supercharging, or like 5 hours of 12v charging or something.  Or somewhere inbetween on a plugshare plug.  And given you're spending 5 hours driving that day/weekend, the fact that you think spending five digits to avoid 4 minutes worth of supercharging, or maybe 10 minutes of park-and-ubering, seems rather irrational.

"LOL, I had a ZX11 in '93. Big and heavy and would still lift the front wheel on launch. Not sure how close I ever got to 3 seconds, but, it took a lot more than ""no skill"" to get close. Never dropped it. Went down on my KX250 more than once, but, that happens when you're racing."
"If I drive my car like a maniac, it gets fewer miles than when I drive like a grandma - just like an ICE does. I regularly get more miles than rated with my car."
Why don't Teslas have more than one gear? 
"Why do you want to measure things just on the right conditions for the petrol car?

Why not overall? Make it from a standstill. Besides, a car can't go faster than 70 mph on highway, unless you are in Germany."
"I have a 2015 GT (6 speed manual) with catback and intake and I can confirm I beat a P85D in a 50mph roll several times. He had me til about 65-70 when I caught traction and pulled away. I was beyond surprised, he walks all over me from a stop, its not even close. "
"That's a good analysis, although that still means the mustang likely loses. I'd like to see someone try this. 

Also, why would the P90D follow the same curve? It has a completely different rear motor with a couple hundred extra horsepower.. "
"We're all talking about a car that you use every day. Stop lights and corners are a thing. Speed limits and your passenger's tolerance for car sickness is a thing.

Remember all the videos of hellcats or adventadors duffing it into the opposite lane when taking off, or especially going around a corner from a stop? That's where the Model S shines. 

Bench racing stats is kinda pointless.

Track days are different animals, if that's your thing you should buy a used formula 1 or can am car. I used to work for a Vintage racing company in California. I definitely see the appeal. Our shop had 2 McLaren F1's and an old McLaren M1B. The open wheel cars are waaaayyyy cooler to take on a track."

"fair enough, i guess you're comparing the X with two top range cars from manufacturers with decades of experience in superior handling. i was (probably unfairly) only comparing the X with SUVs like landcruisers, land rovers, audi Q5, older beemer X5 (before they had active suspension), lexus non-hybrid etc; in which case the Model X holds its own very well

compairing to ml63 and macan S, I was gonna say ""still, the model X is much heavier"" but that was the whole point; and it probably only applies to model X against the smaller and nimbler Macan S anyway.

So yeah, compared to your cars i guess the X still has a lot of room to catch up.

There's one thing i'm really interested in tho - i wonder if there's data listing out how much lateral G's you could pull in different SUV's etc. Its just one factor in many that makes up driver quality/ handling but one many would be interested in knowing."
"It is a several hour detour with Seattle traffic to reach that charger, on what can otherwise be an easy five hour run.

The mountain passes have several gas stations at the base on each side.

I get the distinct impression that you have not spent much time driving in the rural USA. Perhaps I am wrong, but in the PNW, everything is far enough apart that range matters and can be the difference between long detours and direct routes via state highways.

"
"> Good thing that wasn't the answer, please read both comments again. There are two superchargers on the route. I've said that twice. Please read comments before responding to them.

On this one route there are two superchargers, yes (actually, there are 6 between my home and my typical destination for this particular trip).  It's also pretty much the most Tesla-traveled area on the planet.  There are *many* places where there is only one, or zero, superchargers, and in those cases *more range matters*.

> So you're saying that, if you stop for more time than you need to in an EV (30 minutes = 170 miles of range, which is way more than enough to get you 380 miles in a Tesla), and you stop for the minimum possible amount of time in a gas car (time your stops, 15 minutes is quite fast), then you can save fifteen whole minutes in a six hour trip? But wait, if you paid 20 grand for the larger battery, you could save another four minutes with the Tesla? In that six hour trip. Seems cost-effective.

Ignoring that you again misquoted the increase in cost for the larger battery, it's you that needs to read more carefully.

Here's the typical trip in an ICE: Leave home, stop just before the Grapevine for 15 minutes for gas and food, then get back on the road and drive to the destination.  We have consistently done this in 15 minutes many, many times...gas takes about 4 minutes and the rest is restroom and grabbing something to eat which we typically eat on the way.

Here's the trip in the Model X 90D: Leave home, stop at Harris Ranch for a half hour minimum, get back on the road, stop just before the Grapevine for a minimum of 30 minutes, then get back on the road and drive to the destination.  We now eat at this stop instead of on the road, since we have to be there anyway.

The difference is 45 minutes, not 15.  Each way.  It's time and convenience, which is important to us (and to everyone else who perceives the extra range to have value) but apparently not to you.  You're welcome to your own opinion, but it's *your* own opinion.

> This is not an answer to what you can do with 315 which you can't do with 290.

You're ignoring the moron-simple answer to this question, which is make a 315 mile trip without recharging.  That's all the answer really needs to be for anyone who might possibly take a 315 mile trip, but there are other answers...you just don't like them."
You're an incredibly rude person. 
"What I can do is not take an extra day pto because my cross country trip takes substantially less time... Everytime. 25 miles per charge is the important metric here, it isn't a 25 mile one time use addon. I do think the 50+ miles I can get with a 100d is more interesting still but I'm sure you won't understand that either."
"Ugh. You are impossible. I'm saying drive 150 miles one-way to a location without a Supercharger (99% of the destinations you may go to don't have one within a reasonable uber distance) and then drive 150 miles back the same day. Yeah, you might find a J1772, but you can't count on it and the rate of charge is unknown. 

You must live in California. "
"Still at it, eh?  Yes, a weekend trip which is 150 miles in each direction.  The people who have ""driven around the world"" in short range EVs have done so with a ton of planning and compromises along the way.

More range = the ability to travel *without having to be or stay plugged in* = more flexibility, period.  It's mind boggling that you completely dismiss such a simple conclusion.

It's also **120**V, not **12**V (perhaps you're thinking 12**A**?), and it would have to be plugged in *the entire time*, so you have to not want to do *anything* when you get where you're going except stay in one spot.  The fact that ""you're always closer"" to a 120V/12A plug is counterbalanced by the fact that you *can't leave* if that's how you're charging.

You keep pointlessly asking ""where?""  *It doesn't matter where*.  Superchargers are in many places but they are not ubiquitous.  Same with destination chargers, and even (*available*) high voltage plugs are not as common as you seem to think.  Yes, some RV parks have them and if you're lucky, you'll be able to use one and can hopefully stay overnight while you regain 25 miles an hour.  Yes, many houses have them...in the laundry room.  Good luck running a cord from the laundry room or the basement to the driveway or even the garage.  So the answer to ""where?"" is ""a 150 mile trip that doesn't happen to have a supercharger anywhere along it, and that has no convenient destination charger that's level 2 or better.""

It sounds like you either never take long range trips, or if you do it's either within some bubble that works for you because it has convenient charging, *or* you expect to sit in one place the entire time.  The first condition is nowhere near universal for everyone, and not everyone wants to do the second.  Some people actually like to *just drive around and look at the countryside*.

TL,DR: your opinion is *your* opinion and you getting hot under the collar that other people are excited by the additional range makes you sound like Clint Eastwood howling at an empty chair at the last RNC, or an old man on his porch shaking his cane complaining about how horses were plenty useful before those damnable automobiles came along."

"Torque =/= power. The power curve of a Tesla, at least at 0-60 speeds, looks very similar to an ICE. Additionally, torque in the Tesla is linear for most of the 0-60 run: https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/attachments/tesla-model-s-power-and-torque-png.23100/"
Because there are [dynamic forces at work](http://i.imgur.com/hz0Bdjl.jpg).  It's not as simple as you think it is.  
"Well, there is a theoretical limit where the energy of the electrons allow for quantum tunneling between the coils. Of course, the temperature would reach uhhhh catastrophic levels before then. But if you cooled the motor enough (superconductivity) you could do it. "
So the Tesla P100DL's 0-60 is not as fast as a Veyron?
"The battery has a minor impact on handling- Tesla suspensions are just as engineered as any other higher-end suspension.  The battery is an extra edge, but Tesla already puts in a ton of effort.  Every Model S has smart air suspension as an option because good suspensions are something they take very seriously.

A 30 kWh battery would raise the center of mass less than two people riding in the car would.  The battery would probably be lower down for about the same weight (~350 lbs).  It alters the handling enough that your average schmuck might be able to notice a difference, but it absolutely wouldn't ruin it.

Also retuning a suspension is relatively simple.  Most mechanical engineers fresh out of college should be able to do out the basics on paper."

"Have you never tried to drive your Tesla in anger for an extended period of time? The batteries can't keep cool and go into limp mode astoundingly quickly.

">Why do you want to measure things just on the right conditions for the petrol car?

>just the right conditions 

Mate your car spends more time moving at a constant speed than it does launching from traffic lights. 

Rolling on the highway is something millions upon millions of Americans do everyday. 

>Besides, a car can't go faster than 70 mph on highway, unless you are in Germany.

The fucking *posted* speed limit in the United States Interstate System varies anywhere between 55 to *85* mph depending on the state with 65 being the normal. 

Regardless in almost every single case traffic will be moving 5-10mph over the posted limit. 
 

Not to mention 'overall' a Model S won't be able to use ludicrous mode to begin with since it locks you out of the option if you're under 95% battery. "
"Which is exactly why I'd like to see teslas  get lighter.   Because even in the weight is lower it's still there.   It strains suspensions,  tires and brakes.

the Civics and Corollas being made in 2019 years started their design life in 2015, using engines that started their design in 2013 or earlier.

read my statement more carefully.  No significant new ICE engine development will be be initiated from now on (that will have a positive return on investment) and no new ICE car development will be initiated after 2019 (again with the caveat on ROI).  VW, Toyota, Mercedes, BMW, BYD, and others have already stated such.

> Honestly, the only people who worry about stuff like this are people who don't drive EVs. It's really not a concern to people who already do drive them.

That was very rude, dismissive, and condescending. It willfully ignores the point of my response, that of the increased range making barriers fall, and focuses on ways that those aren't really barriers and if you were good enough or willing to sacrifice enough, you should be okay with less range.

You asked a question, I offered an example, and rather than merely disagree with me you called me No True Scotsman and dismissed me out of hand. I needed to come up with a ""real example"".

Then, the thing that really set you off was me treating your statement with the same disdain that you treated mine, ultimately ending up with you attempting to gaslight me into taking responsibility for the tone of this conversation when that is firmly in your court.

Yeah. I'm hoping for 300 miles minimum on my Model 3. That should let me do 500 miles per day pretty easily.

"Correct, but your assertion is still false as torque in the Tesla is linear for nearly the entire 0-60 run."
But there is a fundamental level to how energetic you can make the electrons. Sure they won't produce heat but they'll tunnel to the other side of the coil
"Well, it was pretty hot. Maybe about 105 on the road?

I'm just still a bit tentative about electric cars as something for enthusiasts. And as a lifelong car guy, sometimes I get a bit ticked at Tesla fans who couldn't care less about cars, but are suddenly experts about performance and the industry. Maybe I'm just bitter about my V8s becoming a thing of the past. Sorry if I came across like a dick."

"Mate, I don't go 10/10 in the canyons. I stay on my side and pull over when I need to.  Do you really not ""get"" the appeal of canyon driving? It's completely different from the track. It's the reason that sports cars exist.

In terms of being asinine, I'm going to have to disagree. The Tesla isn't completely absent any sporting pretension. It has several things that I admire in performance cars. It corners well, has a very low COD, feels planted to the road and accelerates out like nothing else (until it gets a bit hot). 

But it entirely lacks in other areas. And it's those areas that to me, are what matter. It's not playful. It's numb. It's heavy. There's no sound. The car evokes no emotion in me beyond an appreciation for the technology and innovation. 

I don't hate the Model S. It's a fantastic car. But it's not built with my type of driving in mind. So when it's touted as ""duh fastest bestest car evur dat kan murder da supercars"" I get a little ticked. "
"Tesla is not a great track car. This article is about how the Tesla is capable of accelerating as fast as any other production car. Since you brought up Nurburgring, I was wondering if you plan on taking your very expensive car there or if the performance around a track will determine your decision whether or not to buy a family sedan. I suspect you aren't in the market for a performance luxury vehicle and you're just another critic who brings up fanciful ideas in your imagination to say, ""Yeah, but."""
I think this only works in urban areas. I could be wrong
"Uh, I live in LA, right off the 110 and no, it's not.. It's at capacity between 6am-10am and again at 4pm to 7pm.. The rest of the time it's like you see in the photo. It's not hard to merge into stop and go traffic on that short of a ramp. So clearly I'm talking about the rest of the time when people could be driving a lot smarter."
Checks out. It's super good.
"Elon, is that you?  Stop wasting time on Reddit and make a real car."
"So, responding to your example and showing you why an EV is perfectly capable in your example is ""rude?""  You claimed that a trip covered by two superchargers is too cumbersome, I pointed out the superchargers, and you got mad that I pointed out superchargers.  Talk about being set off easily.

 I'll make sure to keep that in mind - your ego is so large that you interpret anyone trying to teach you something as rude.

Which is, of course, something that a rude person would think.  Cheers."
I would not be at all surprised to see a 300-mile option for the Model 3.
"Okay. Didn't realize that. The only reason I can think of is that the motor is electrically limited in some way, which may mean that aerodynamic forces could increase the 0-60 time"

"If you are driving through canyons and are pushing a Tesla hard enough to go into limp mode within five minutes, you are being an idiot. I still do not believe this ever happened to you. As for canyon driving, I get it. I've owned a half dozen Miatas as street cars and race cars and have owned many other ""enthusiast"" cars. 10 years ago, Miata was the standard response as my favorite car and the Lotus Elise was the greatest sports car ever built in my eyes (until I drove a Roadster). I've been an enthusiast for 25+ years and even worked in the automotive enthusiast magazine publishing industry. I had press fleet cars delivered to me on a weekly basis and got paid to write auto reviews on everything from a Dodge Neon to an Audi S8 and nearly everything inbetween. I've driven Lamborghinis and R8s and they are all fun, but, they are douche mobiles. I've been involved in some of the biggest, most famous sports car races in The world. I'm an enthusiast and a Model S owner. When people ask me about my car, all I can say is ""it is the best car ever built."" I'll never buy another ICE vehicle for the rest of my life. I don't race anymore and really don't have much desire to go to the track anymore. Your criteria isn't my criteria. In fact, I could have purchased a P85D, but, decided the S70 was plenty for what I needed in a family sedan. Even the 70 is more than sufficient for daily driving. What Tesla has accomplished with this 0-60 is beyond incredible. You've got to understand that when the ""yeah, buts"" come out, it sounds petty and stupid. All these people saying, ""yeah, but"" probably will never consider actually buying any of the cars they are comparing the Model S to. They aren't the target audience for these cars, so, their opinion really doesn't matter."
"If you bring up the performance of an almost $100k car to the table, do you really think it's unreasonable that I start talking about track and overall performance? Ok."
No it's OVER capacity during that time.

"I've decided I don't have to justify my opinion to you anymore. I tried being polite, talking about the good points of the car, trying to explain how I feel. I thought I was being reasonable. But then you bust out this ego-trip of self-justification and bullshit.

You are the perfect picture of a brand fanboy, who have been a cancer in the industry since its inception. Blind to any problem and convinced that anyone with a different opinion has no value. And I don't give a fuck that you were a hack journalist in a field full of writers that can't drive or some sort of pay-driver wannabe. There are a dozen of you at every track day I attend.  You do your industry discredit. You do the Tesla brand discredit. And you do the Model S discredit. 

Don't bother replying, I'm marking this one a lost cause.

"Yes. It's like saying drag cars are terrible on the track. No shit. This is a street car, made to be driven on roads. To drive to work and home and everywhere inbetween - and does 0-60 as fast as any other production car in the world - and your response is, ""Yeah, but."" It's stupid."
Seriously. I did 0-100 on my Busa in 2.3.

So are most cars I'm talking about, like BMW's M series cars, Audi's RS series, and others. They're all meant to be driven on roads, but they do a bang ass job on the track. It's not ridiculous for me to compare the Tesla against its ICE competitors."
"Okay, no skill required was quite a dumb comment, wouldn't you say?"
"So, you're in the market to buy an M5 or RS7 and take it to Nurburgring?"
"I fail to see what skill is needed to go from 0-60 in 3 seconds, when in fact many mid size sport bike is geared for 0-100 in the first gear, and factoring in the power to weight of a motorcycle.  Show me how you can't do that."
"Wow, you completely missed the point. Nice talk man."
Okay. You sure you did it in 2.3?
"I figured you weren't actually going to buy any of these cars. You bring up a completely useless performance measurement criteria that has zero real world application for most car buyers in daily driving scenarios and point to it and say, ""Yeah, but."" GTFO"
Maybe 4.2?  I can sure outrun a Tesla. 
Why are you so fixated in whether I'm going to buy these cars or not? Am I only allowed to critique a car if I'm going to buy one? Am I also only allowed to critique my football team if I own it?
Okay.
Because these cars are for sale and their features and performance only really matter to the people who are actually going to buy them. Otherwise you're just a guy with a stupid opinion on Reddit.
You might be too blinded in your love for Tesla. 
I can see you're not a car guy if you think only people interested in buying certain cars are allowed to talk about them.

Next thing you'll tell me that is that Tesla is getting into plumbing."
Can someone point to some arguments as to why solar city and tesla together could be considered a trust? I thought musk already owned both
My brain combined antitrust and SolarCity and some how i came out with Tesla is buying SunTrust Bank.
I assume his next plan is for SpaceX to buy Tesla so we get electric rockets!
Beautiful. The established energy and transport companies have refused to evolve for 50 years. Musk is about to make them do it while kicking and screaming. Bravo. 
I don't know how Tesla would go to court for antitrust when banks and broadcast/ISP companies just get free reign. 
Will it be possible for cars to one day supply power to our homes by storing them in batteries? 
Let's coat the planet in solar shingles.
"Why hasn't anybody attempted to form the batteries into panels is my thought process. Like, make the battery safe, and rigid enough to almost make the car out of it. "
"Whoa why is this such a big deal? That's a lot of upvotes.

Can someone ELI5?"
Now all they have to do is have solarcity's shareholders vote on the proposal.  Little weird that Musk bought 65million in solarcity bonds before the merger.
I would be against companies merging together but this is an exception please don't turn into like Comcast

"Almost all epipens are produced by a single company that's hiking the price to screw over millions of people, but it's the electric car company that wants to get into renewable energy that has to fight tooth and nail against anti-trust laws."
"Buying a bankrupt company wouldn't be stopped by the regulators. :)

People really took this comment personally. I'm a huge Tesla fan, but it is obvious that SolarCity is in dire need of a cash infusion. I also don't need fake internet points."
Why does it seem like this company has to go to court for every little thing? 
"SAFE.  Now Tesla is in a far better position for when they fuck up the Model 3.  Here's why:

When the fuck up happens (and it will happen) the cost are going to be staggering by any account.   The fact that GIGA 1 will still be able to operate and sell batteries is what will SAVE Tesla during this temporary inevitable event, buying critical time, to correct the problem.  It is another brilliant move, by a brilliant entrepreneur."
Antitrust laws are bullshit. The best way to stymy monopolies is by letting other monopolies to develop and opposition.

Combine that with a house and start dropping in some EV developed communities.   
That's exactly what they're going to do. I'm almost positive Musk hinted at that in his last update.
That is literally the point of the deal. Combined logistics helps keep the price down on a completely sustainable energy ecosystem.
"Solar would be what, 10-15k for a house? Maybe less in a few years. Another 10k for a battery, and 35k for the car. Sounds expensive, but that's 60k for a car, free gas, and free power. Plus the cost of solar panels will probably wash out when you sell the house. "
"That's the goal, the next step. One shot you get a solar roof, a battery to protect you from power outage, and a car that will drive you to work every day. Uber is going to be very short-lived. "
"Just for openness - big Tesla and Solar fan here.   Tesla S on order, Tesla 3 reservation, Tesla investor,  and already have installed a 10kw solar system.

With that being said, I don't see a reason that Tesla needed to buy Solar City (unless there is something else to the plan that we aren't aware of).   They could have set up a channel sales program that allowed Tesla to resell Solar City (and other solar vendors where Solar City doesn't have a presence).

As an investor in Tesla, I hope there is more to this plan because I'm not seeing the direct value in outright owning Solar City."
"hey, you still have a hockey team. Be proud."
"So, because Tesla is amazing, are they going to give solar panels to every home in the city as an example?    That would be sweet...

""Move to Buffalo, where every single home has solar panels and electricity is free, as each home feeds the grid!    Then, at night, each home has a PowerWall and everyone works together for their nightly energy needs!  100% off grid, all built in the giant Tesla factory in downtown Buffalo!   Even the factory is powered by all of the solar from each and every home.   There is so much electricity that Niagara Falls electricity is now 100% sold to other states to boost the Niagara Falls and Buffalo economy even more, while lowering electric bills to neighboring states!"""

That eventually they'll be owners of roughly 1/8th that number of shares of $TSLA.

"> afterwards a stockholder vote will be done.

I have no direct experience with SolarCity but I've only heard horrible things about them from every angle. I'm very curious how Tesla plans to fix up their act quickly under Tesla Energy so it doesn't drag the whole Tesla brand down.

"They were still separate companies with their own directors and shareholders, though. Antitrust law is a lot broader in scope than just preventing monopolization. If the merger was going to ""significantly reduce competition,"" it wouldn't be allowed to go through. Check out [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merger_control#Non-horizontal_mergers) section for a little more info."
"Do you doubt he will? If one thing is clear, Elon wants to enslave the Sun."
Elon confirmed there's no reason for the two companies to merge since they are part of entirely different industries that have very little overlap. He also said he expects all transportation methods to go electric except rockets.
I don't think it works like that. But I'm not a rocket scientist.

"That would be hellishly bad for the environment, and batteries are touchy. Hell, there's been phones that have exploded cause the battery went pop. Now you wanna cover a car with that where it's exposed to the heat, elements, and a potential accident?"
Battery storage isn't the issue ... 
"This is the worst idea I've ever seen. Batteries are pretty dangerous and fickle, putting them in a place where they can be easily damaged makes no sense at all."
Big mergers need to be approved by the FTC and DoJ to determine if they'll significantly harm competition. It was just another step in the process that's now complete. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart%E2%80%93Scott%E2%80%93Rodino_Antitrust_Improvements_Act) are some details.
"Those are junk-level bonds and are paying quite well if you can trust that Solarcity won't default on them. If Elon can get the Tesla owners to buy in, the price of those bonds will go way up for a nice profit for Elon. If the merger falls though and Solarcity stock goes to zero, Elon should still be able to recover some of his bond investment.

Between this and his relatives who run Solar City, Elon has a lot of personal investment in this deal. It smells a tad funny."
You're a dude. Fuck off.
"They aren't ""fighting against anti-trust laws,"" they're just going through the [required process.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart%E2%80%93Scott%E2%80%93Rodino_Antitrust_Improvements_Act)"

"snug remarks helps nobody. this sub has turned kinda sour lately, why is that?"
I'm looking to buy a home and Tesla next year. An integrated package deal would actually be a perfect fit. 
"Its what they have planned, no doubt.  There's a large question around whether or not they can make it affordable for the consumer.  The Powerwall and Solar panels with installation easily cost as much as a Model 3. The ""solar roof"" industry Elon wants to get into is plagued with technical problems.  Solar roof tiles are not a novel idea; others have tried and failed to create an affordable product that actually works.

Elon believes consumers are all set to drop $35K on solar panels and batteries just as soon as they can buy them all from one source.  This completely ignores that consumers are already connected to an electrical grid that's far cheaper."
"$60K is enough money to buy *two* brand new Honda Civics with Autopilot (aka Honda Sensing), 10 years of gas for *each* car, and pay the electric bill for the average US house for 6 years. "

"Except in winter, when all of our solar panels are buried under 5 feet of snow!"
It's fairly unlikely but not outside the realm of possibility.  If they are already up and running they are likely to just invest in growing the existing factory rather than replace it however as the costs to stop and move production is not something they can afford at the moment. 
The Buffalo factory is the gigafactory.

Nope. You're correct.
"Where (I believe) the board of the company being purchased ~~is required~~ to go see if they can get a better offer - this is to the benefit of the current owners, eg shareholders, to insure the offer is a fair market price."
"It's a provision the board would want to have as a means to extract the highest possible value for the company. In this particular case, it's hard to believe anyone would be able to price the target above what Tesla is offering given the obvious synergies, so in reality it functions more as protocol and legal basis for defending themselves in court for when the board (and its advisors, if any) inevitably get sued for selling for too cheap.

On a more abstract basis, go-shop provisions have the downside of disrupting the target's ongoing business as they basically remove any confidentiality on the deal and spark countless rumors.

Some bids for companies may alternatively have a no-shop provision which prevent the board from soliciting offers from other potential buyers (although they are free to consider unsolicited ones), which is basically the acquirer saying ""take it or leave it"".

Regardless, I don't agree with him: An integrated solar/battery product growing the way solarcity has will look nice on paper, but it will still consume cash, probably until 2020 or so when costs are low enough."
"The problem is that the government frequently uses anti-trust laws to repress competition, like the electric car industry, and doesn't use them to break up the real monopolies, like the massive auto companies. They're abusing the law for the exact opposite purpose it was intended for."
"I don't have my sources in front of me, but the government has, both intentionally and unintentionally, created and sustained more monopolies in our history than the free market ever allowed.  That's not to say they don't exist in truly free markets, but the government has almost never made the issue better."

"To ""go from $8 to $800"" starting today, Tesla would have to become worth $3.2 trillion dollars, or 5.6 times more valuable than the most valuable company in the world.

Tesla's potential future growth is already baked into the share price. 

A niche luxury car maker that puts out 50K cars a year with ambitions for 500K (versus 5-10 million each by Toyota/GM/VW/Nissan/Hyundai/Ford) isn't worth $32 billion by any present day valuation, yet that's where investors have the stock pegged."

My house in the Summer is using 50-70 kWh / day (palm springs, 115 degrees+ every day) any my solar only produces ~30, so the powerwalls would really only be useful for certain times of the year where I over produce (but I technically ""bank"" that as credit and use it during the summer months)"

The FCC is asleep at the wheel and has been for further back in history than I've looked in a long time. Far easier to prevent horrific mergers than to police them through the DOJ - who seems to care more about fines and restrictions than splitting up the large offenders: see Microsoft. The reluctance to break up the big banks during the crisis was equally as troubling, but not necessarily a monopoly situation - it just shows how little the government actually does about shit.

The cable companies today are probably the most obvious example. We regulate electric and power companies like utilities, yet allow firms like Time Warner to have free reign to make absurd money.

I could make it there on one charge but then I'm stuck. There's nowhere to recharge.

People who say to rent a car or borrow a car for a trip like this confuse me. Why am I buying a Tesla if I'm not going to drive it on road trips. This kind of trip is ideal for autopilot so why would I want to rent a Camry? I want my car, with my settings, and my music preloaded, and my cellphone paired.

There are still some serious issues with recharging that have to be addressed and down voting someone who's bringing that up isn't productive. "
"That might be true in the mid west, or mountain territories. For anybody who lives in more densely populated areas, the supercharger network is already dense enough for a 200+ mile range car to be practical. I downloaded an app called plugshare and mapped trips to my parents house, and ski destinations, and anywhere else I'd be driving. Tesla is the only company who seems to be taking fast charging seriously. There are a few SAE and CHADEMO fast chargers around the city I'm in, but those do me no good for a road trip. If I can get 180 miles of range in a half hour, that makes it practical. I usually stop for 20 mins to get a snack and hit the bathroom anyway. What's an extra ten if the fuel is free and clean? Superchargers are the reason I signed up for a model 3. That, above all else, makes them a practical replacement for a gas car."

"I totally agree. I'll bet it'll be a dominant class in 50 yrs. Millennials love to travel and owning a car that can autonomously drive you to many parts of the globe, [like the Bering strait as a thoroughfare]( http://m.imgur.com/0E7DueA?r) and access to S. America via a super-super highway allowing the 95% of the earth to be accessible very inexpensively will become a way of life. Working from your car, (it'll likely be a hotel room pod) since most of our jobs will be automated, will be the norm and you'll be able to go around the globe in 7 days for a little get away for only the cost of food like you'd spend at home. No fuel costs as the roads will be wireless battery pads constantly charging the cars while being powered by massive free solar and wind fields.

 Its a good time to be alive. "

"A company like Exxon owns a huge portion of the energy chain in the world.

Yet it is not never close to a trillion dollar company.

The entire oil and gas industry combined has a market cap of around $2 trillion. And they own much of the worlds energy chain.

Tesla will never ever get to that size."
Not 10 times higher though. 
JB Straubel has talked about this a couple of times and has come down against it. He believes that EV batteries have chemistry that is not well suited for powerwall-like applications and are better served by standalone battery systems.
"you can certainly run off solar+battery in an outage and be grid-tied most of the time. 
it just isn't a common configuration for home systems because grid outages are uncommon. 

I'd bet money tesla's first integrated solar+battery system will have that feature built-in.

"The gigafactory is hopelessly behind schedule, according to Musk it's 14% finished, if they don't meed the production demands of Panasonic by 2018 (which they wont), they lose part of the ownership to Panasonic. And further delays will lose them even more of it. 


Tesla is burning money like crazy, they might run out again end of year and would have to raise cash a 3rd time. This is by far the worst moment to integrate a failed company which is also bleeding money at an astonishing rate. Solarcity will never be able to compete with Asian manufacturers. 


Musks whole idea is very good, but the way he handles it is terrible  Tesla is 14 years old now and still cash flow negative."
"Not really, no."

"A decreasing % of the population, but they do exist :)"
"Maybe instead of a plane, rent a car

This is a stupid objection that I am tired of.  I can't even think of a 1 car family that doesn't  already use a bus or something.  This maybe a problem for like 2% of the population that need to only have 1 car and go more than 300 miles a day.  I think more than 2 % of the population are lactose intolerant, but still we subsidize milk and sell it.

"I think there will be a tipping point if Elon is successful enough. Right now you have a point: there are vastly more gas stations than superchargers so beyond cost there's a convenience factor favoring ICE over electric.

It could be a relatively quick transition from one to the other if enough people switch from ICE to electric, though. Think of all those small convenience store/gas stations that don't get any profits from gas sales but absolutely rely on the income ICE drivers bring when they also stop in and buy something. A lot of those might find it difficult to stay in business if a good % of their customers stop showing up because they don't need gas.

You could see a wave of small, local gas stations closing down and before you know it people find it's not at all convenient to own a gas-powered car because you always have to drive way out to some travel center by the interstate on the edge of town just to fuel up."
"I get what you're saying, but I think you are vastly underestimating the charging infrastructure across America. It's not perfect by any means, but I don't think there are any places in America that you can't reach in a 60 kWh model S. Especially once you consider the level 2 chargers. And new super chargers are opening every week."
10x higher is real possibility if musk accomplishes master plan part 2 in next 10 years.
"Yea for standby  power, you want to prioritize energy density / volume,  not energy density / weight. "
"> JB Straubel has talked about this a couple of times and has come down against it. 

Not true. Tesla vehicles won't feed back into the utility as aggressively as you might think, but they absolutely will be aggregated as loads on demand (think of the Nest thermostat, where your utility scan shed air conditioning loads during peak demand, but instead commanding vehicles to demand power at times when utilities have excess power, perhaps during peak wind/solar generation times).

That's actually upper class. The definitions are super fucked.

Here it would be more along the line of 60k.

"In addition to that, JB mentioned that a stationary battery pack (used with solar) will need to handle more cycles than a car battery pack. You cycle a car battery on average maybe once a week, whereas a solar-backed battery system will cycle once a day. That's a 7x increase in cycle requirements to reach the same lifespan. "

I'm not super well versed though, so it might just be my ignorance speaking :P."

"I hear you. I'm from Oklahoma. Our average HOUSEHOLD income is less than $50k/year.

But as a nation, I believe middle class it typically considered from like $28k-$250k. Typically with lower middle class being from $28k-$100k and upper middle class being $100k-$250k. Some models even take upper middle class to $500k where you officially hit upper class. "
"I'd disagree with it being upper class. It's definitely comfortable, but I don't know anyone making $100k/year that would consider themselves to be upper class.

Beyond that, it doesnt fit in as upper class for any of the economic models that I've seen."
Does that mean 200k combined income for a family is rich?
 Rental cars are totally not a thing. Nobody ever uses those for unexpected long trips.
"This is not an either/or.  Noone is outlawing gas cars, or stopping manufacturer of new gas cars.  If it does not work for you (which I bet it would for you personally , you are arguing for fun or something) then don't buy it.


Why object to something just because, like everything else on the planet, 100% of people cannot use it?

It's like trying to outlaw cars because of drunk driver.  And there is a he'll of a lot more drunk drivers than people who NEED to travel more than 300 miles a day and cannot afford 2 cars or a reliable family or friend.

 You say the same thing I have heard so many times and it still isn't valid, no matter how many times I hear it.  The product doesn't work for some people, and that is fine, I for one am very excited to see a tesla in my price range for when I buy a car in 3 to 6 years."
"For Li-ion batteries, they can handle multiple cycles of discharge and charging.... as long as you aren't doing deep cycle discharges.  For example, if your cell phone is generally charging most of the time except for a few hours a day when you are out of the house or away from your car, the battery will last for quite a while.  Waiting for the battery to almost completely discharge before charging, however, is a bad thing for that chemistry except as something only occasionally done.

NiCd batteries, on the other hand, are much more suited to deep discharges and don't take too kindly to constant trickle charges.  That chemistry is still used for battery operated power tools (aka cordless drills) and some electric golf carts.  It doesn't last as long or holds as much of a charge as Li-ion though.

Let's just say that the Tesla battery pack is ingenious all by itself and patent worthy.  I'm also confident that the Tesla engineers could customize battery technology to be better suited for residential applications, which seems to be more of what the power wall is going to become."

"It depends on what you mean by rich, and where you're living. $500k/year is considered middle class in NYC. $200k/year would set you up in the top 1% in Oklahoma or Mississippi.

But I think what he was saying was that in aggregate, $200k/year would be considered upper middle class."
"No. In America, upper middle class starts at 200k in the suburbs"
"I honestly didn't realize this was a tesla subreddit, I browsed here from all. My fault. What I'm saying would be like going into a Hillary subreddit and arguing about how she's unfit for president. I'm done here."
"This is exactly what JB has indicated. A chemistry tweak for residential batteries in order to maximize lifespan. Maybe eventually they'll come up with a perfect chemistry for all uses, but for now we'll have custom formulations for car vs residential. This is also the reason why JB doesn't like the idea of using a Tesla car battery as a temporary home battery, because it would too rapidly cycle the battery and the current models aren't optimized for it. "
Well that explains it. North Dakota is about as unrepresentative of America as it gets. The Houston metro area has 15x as many people as the entire state. 
"I don't subscribe to tesla, I came here from the front page.

The argument that not everyone can use one 100% of the time is weak, in all subreddits.

This issue only applies only to 1 car, 2+ driver families, that travel more the 300 miles in a day, that do not have a strong local support network, and do not have a major credit card (only reason I could think that someone could not rent a car, but could afford to buy a new car that had a waiting list.)  I think there are more drivers with put use of their legs than driver that fit in the above situation.

If that is the only issue it's a super great car."
