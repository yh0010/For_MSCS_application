"That‚Äôs damn cool... especially with the door opening as you approach. You half expect Jarvis to be like ‚ÄúGood evening sir, we had a little rain in your absence, I trust you remained dry‚Äù with that British accent lol. "
"They say that necessity is the mother of invention... I say that laziness is

Tesla knows what we really want lol "
Was this sped up? I thought summon takes of time a bit to move forward that far.
"If I owned this, I‚Äôd forget that I had the feature and would have still tried to super jump over the puddle and hop into the car like a spy hopping through laser trip-wire."
"Oh yeah? **My** car gurgles when I turn it on. Beat that. 

:("
Now I wanna make money and get a Tesla dammit that was so cool
"I thought summon makes the vehicle come to you, not just in a straight line?"
This is the future. 
Does the 3 have this feature?
"The car needs a voice saying [""Get in loser we're going shopping""](https://i.imgur.com/trMmqXs.gif)"
Probably sounds corny but I use summon every day. My girlfriend can‚Äôt get in the passenger side while the car is in the garage so I summon it out and open her door for her. I kinda like the gentlemanly feel of it. Otherwise I would have to pull out of the garage and yell out the window ‚Äúget in woman!‚Äù  Doesn‚Äôt feel quite the same. 
"I need this on my accessible van so that every time an asshole parks where they aren't supposed to (I'm speaking to you, BMW piece of crap at the MSP airport) I can have it roll out so I can deploy my ramp without property damage (oops)."
"That is indeed a good use of it, but I don't think many people are eager to use this feature in other scenarios."
"""Welcome to Jurassic Park..."" I immediately thought of that line when i saw this lol."
Holy shit. The future is here
Would that have driven over to you if you wanted it to? Or does it just go in a straight line? Thanks. 
Will it back itself into the spot as well?  I can see this being useful in tight spots.
‚ÄúHere boy!‚Äù
A link to this post was just tweeted by @Tesla: https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/956568772189421569
I can see this being a practical feature when some douche-bag parks too close to my car and I can‚Äôt get in. 
"Uhhhh, I work at the same place and not having a Tesla meant wading into 3 inches of water. Socks were soaked as was the cuff of my pants.
No amount of summoning charms could save me..."

I want to watch an action movie where a guy is running away from cops on foot and while he is approaching the parking lot summons his tesla reeeealy slowly and you just watch it from a distance moving slowly out of its spot as he is running out of breath and jumps inside his car through the automatic door and speeds away ACTUALLY THAT WOULD BE A GREAT COMMERCIAL 
"Fuck I wish I could afford a tesla, I've wanted an electric car ever since grade school, always thought it would be awesome to convert a hummer to a full electric vehicle so you could call smart cars gas guzzlers.

Course even if there was some magic raffle, or a steep government discount like some countries have I still wouldn't have anywhere to put a charging station :/ sucks because I drive a shitload for work too."
"""It is wet out. Come to me, car.""

"You had it do this twice, didn't you? It looks like there are tracks from the first time."
Probably backed it in that spot for the Karma.
"Yeah, I'm fucking poor..."
Fuuuture! Fuuuuuuture!
Don't pissoff the Tesla
This is pleasant to my human eyes.
I want a Tesla so much
Well that's bossy. 
One of the few scenarios where I'd trust it after seeing videos of some of the mishaps 
Man the X looks amazing in that color especially with those wheels. üòç
Next thing you know we'll have a fucking batmobile operating like that
Would it stop if someone was in front of it when you summoned it?
Did you park in the same spot when you got back?
So beautiful. Can you open any of the other doors as well or just the driver's?
This is so dope
I‚Äôd purposely make situations like this just to use this feature 
Wish I could summon the money to buy one. That's sweet!
I need to become rich... 
"Umm stop the press it opens the door for you too, that's it buying on today!"
God I need a Tesla 
What's it like being knightrider?
I'm gonna save this video to show to my family members who aren't convinced that Teslas are cool.
"‚ÄúWhat is my purpose?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou move forward a few feet‚Äù

‚Äú...omg‚Äù"
Damn bro that's almost a quarter inch deep puddle.
That feature I‚Äôve used in those puddle moments 
That is the best Model X color/wheel combo 
This is officially the future 
That's pretty slick!
I want one.
God I want one so badly. What do you do for work Op
Cool
That‚Äôs so cool!
omfg that‚Äôs so sick 
Who's A Good Boy? Your a Good Boy Tesla!
I hope you used the appropriate force gestures. 
I didn't know it could do this. 
Your car is my exact config dream car
That is seriously incredible.
"Tesla needs to use this as part of their advertising campaign in the future!  

Very nice!

Ohmy God it's the future :O
üòÆ wow!
This car starts on its own and i have to push mine for it to start lol
This is the 2018 I've watched movies about
"I like how OP parks in puddles just so he can do this.. I mean, I would too but still. "
God damn the future is now.
"Aw, this would not work in EU though. I *very* rarely use the summon feature, mostly because we can't do it from a distance. Basically have to be close enough to touch the car to enable summon :/. It works great to get out of crammed parking spots though.

Get the fuck out. Seriously? That's some awesome shit right there. Maybe a Tesla might be in my future.

And then BOOM! Some idiot on their phone T-Bones your autobot.
Pretty sure if you can afford that car you can probably just throw cash into the puddle and walk across that.
"That vehicle is gorgeous! I just ordered an X100D in Midnight Silver Metallic. Are those the 22"" wheels from Tesla? I ordered the same wheels but aftermarket in 20"" from TSportline.

That's awesome.

Not fair. I want one.
Summon is awesome. One of my fav features for sure. 
"Fantastic, very important feature for hurricane season :-)"
I consider myself a car guy and I follow everything auto. I have not seen this before and it has blown my mind. How does it know to only go so far????? I‚Äôm speechless. This has made me want a Tesla even more now.
"Waiting for Summon on the 3‚Ä¶ this ""manually parking in my garage"" rubbish needs to come to an end, stat. "
TIL Tesla is lit.
That‚Äôs an expensive puddle
GOD DAMIT I want one. Hurry the f' up with the model 3 right side drive. 
"as someone with driving anxiety i cannot wait until tesla's are affordable.  

in my first month of having a license i got into an accident(i stopped at a red light and someone drove in my back) and never managed to get over it and drive again, i just stress out too much. it becomes so uneasy that i can't pay attention to the road anymore."

How difficult is it to compromise this feature?

"Yup, I just bought a stock in Tesla after seeing this. Gawd damz"

The water isn't even that deep...
The single most obvious r/hailcorporate post I've ever seen on reddit 
"Uhh.. Do you live in a place where a few mm of water is scary or something?

Edit: Before y'all continue to downvote.. I think this is super cool. However, it seems pretty ridiculous and time consuming to do this when it's hardly any water. That's all I'm saying."
Does the model 3 have this?
"Okay, but can it deploy shield panels to protect it from break ins or vandalism while you're away?  Can it jettison 2/3rds of its fiberglass superstructure and pull its wheels in to slip down narrow alleys?  Does it have a large rotating plate underneath it can push down under the center body so it can rotate in place like a tank?  

IDK, if it can't fire a comically oversized grapnel to pull the whole car up the side of a building, it's probably just a stupid gimmick."
I want to say it's cool...but it also creeps me out a bit

I watched a video recently about the bmw m760Li and one feature is being able to drive the car in a straight line forwards and reverse with the key. I‚Äôve never been the biggest bmw fan but the amount of tech in this car is absolutely insane. It‚Äôs obviously not a Tesla but I was amazed at just how much technology they crammed into this car. Definitely an interesting video. https://youtu.be/tyxPYgNzLa8

"looks like san jose tech business parking lot, plus it rained today. amiright?"
Elon musk is fucking the whole German automotive sector which was world leading for about 100 years. Elon musk is doing this in 10 years.

How come OP is not near his car during summon? My car needs the keys to be near proximity during Summon. 
"Those wheels are a $5,500 option. I still have a hard time wrapping my wallet around that. "

Its that and automatic feature from the car itself? Or you customize it?

Pretty much useless in Europe. Have to stand right next to the door and often does not connect/confirm proximity. Ie in car parks where it would actually be useful

Tesla is making amazing bounds and leaps. And they waste it on the lazy
Legit question: whats stopping someone from using this as a suicide bomb transport device? (without the suicide of course)
Cars should be much more advanced than this. They should certainly be able to drive more than just a straight line autonomously.
If you cant walk through a puddle you should try sleeping on a busy street.
Are you kidding me? This is the epitomy of being a pussy. You can't walk through a fucking puddle? This gif sums up why I hate Tesla owners.

"that's not being lazy tho, that's just smart"
"I once had a boss (she was a bosses boss actually) who told me that I had the ‚Äúlazy gene‚Äù like she did. I totally understood how she meant it, but she explained immediately that it was a compliment due to how I automated so many tasks making several departments drastically more efficient, and that I was always looking for a more efficient (lazier) way of doing things. Which was greatly appreciated by everyone. 

My direct boss overheard and got pretty upset on my behalf. She called me into her office and apologized for the comment and seemed to be really worried I was insulted (I worked my ass off and was really productive and valued). I had to explain to her how it was a compliment and not an insult. She didn‚Äôt really get it. 

I always found that a really accurate description of my talents. I‚Äôm a hard worker, but I‚Äôm a lazy lazy man. It irritates me to do manually what can be done automatically. My laziness always benefits everyone I work with, because it annoys me when they have to do stuff that they don‚Äôt need to as well. I‚Äôm lazy on their behalf. So I‚Äôll work like a dog to make sure that some process that takes someone a couple hours a month takes a couple seconds instead.

"Not much difference in this case, but all it does right now is straight lines forward or backward. It's getting better thanks to over the air updates."
"I am pretty sure Tesla advertised summon coming to you autonomously a while back, but it can only really do forward and backwards while being monitored right now. I think they said it will be able to come to you anywhere on your private property ( so like going from the garage to your front door to pick you up)."
I thought it makes the vehicle come to you through a magic portal and shoot megaflares at your enemy

What a time to be alive
It will but not yet. 
"to add to what u/Gforce1 says about it coming in a software update (It will but not yet).

You have to pay for Enhanced Autopilot* to have access to summon on the Model 3. So that's a $5000 software package.

* People tend to use EAP as an acronym to mean Enhanced Autopilot but Tesla puts it in print as 2 words not 3 so it wouldn't be EAP but should be EA which no one wants to use for some reason. :)"

"I use it to pull my car out of my garage, every time.

(Wide car, narrow garage opening, mirrors folded, so summoning it out is the safest way.  Of course I supervise it closely and am ready to hit the stop button.)"
I also use it when I realize I could have pulled into a parking spot a little bit more. It's sometimes easier to judge from outside the car.

You can get a used leaf with low mileage for around $11k. They‚Äôre a ton of fun to drive and have half decent storage. I would have bought one as a daycare-commuter car but the front impact rating is ‚Äúpoor‚Äù. Other than that it‚Äôs a pretty cool car.

"No. There are proximity sensors in the bumper, so it will stop for obstacles. And it moves very slow (this GIF is sped up quite a bit). If the car encounters a bump in its path, it will disengage and stop. It won't even climb a kerb, let alone a human lying down."

It pulls forward by the same amount it last pulled back. There is a setting for how close you want it to back up to something. Alternatively you can control it with the app or the key fob.
AFAIK the Telsa can park itself automatically.

"No. (Not yet anyway, but it should do via a future software update.)"
You get it to start moving by looking away and to stop by looking at it. Standard red light/green light controls. I agree it was a creepy design choice.
"It's on the 5 and 7 series BMWs as a remote control parking feature! Crazy stuff, especially with the likes of wireless charging on some BMWs becoming a thing too apparently http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/video-bmw-remote-control-parking-system-technology-article-1.2953729

Nice.  And the key fob (seen at 24:34) is even better than Tesla's!  (Though Tesla has an app you can use too.)

I'll take your order whenever you're ready.
You control it via the fob or app. It‚Äôs just a ‚Äúforward‚Äù and ‚Äúbackward‚Äù button. 
What's different in eu?
"We don't have that yet and that's the problem. Tesla is saying they are able to drive around themselfs, but legally they can't yet."
An electric motor 
You have to hold down the button on the fob or in the app for it to move. And it only moves forward and back. People generally use it to get the car out of a parking space when someone parks too close to you.
It's called the Model X. There are plenty of pictures online if you want to see the interior.
"Bjorns X is blue, but i did see he has a video today showing this as well. Haven‚Äôt watched it yet. "
"Yeah, but you have to be in the car for that. And it's too slow for anyone to actually use. 

This summon feature in the GIF is more useful when someone parks too close to your car and you can't get in."
It's controlled on your phone through the Tesla app. Forward and backward button. No turning with summon mode
As far as I know it's been a feature for the Model X since they came out.
Summon.
"I own some, but unlike most people I don't bring them everywhere with me."
Thanks. Still waiting on my check...
I get a little tired of the Tesla worship.  They're nice cars but way overpriced and forget about insuring at a reasonable price.
Why do poor people need this?
"I don't know if that's really fair to say. I've seen Tesla drive between Seattle and Spokane all the time. The range has gotten to the point where it is no longer inhibitive. If you really want to get into it, they are better than a ICE vehicle because they don't lose power at altitude. The Model X has a longer range than my car, which is kinda crazy."
"Same thing people said when autopilot was announced. And pretty much the only clips we see are people putting oranges on the steering wheel.

So I think that's pretty unlikely. People just like to hate on it when they can't afford it. Probably makes you feel better."
Not enough.
I think the puddle is below most people.
What's gonna happen? 
You'll be just in time to never have to drive again.
"True, the software/firmware being remotely updatable is a risk.  I hope Tesla has the best security people in California working for them.  (Actually there are also [risks](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2014/01/the_internet_of_thin.html) to making software updates difficult, but still.)"
what rain? who said it was raining
Really? I had people nearly fighting for my Model S with 80k miles on it. Soon as they saw my X they started offering all cash for that instead.  Caught me way off guard so when i started researching I found huge demand in the used Tesla market... strange to hear this. 
"[This article](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/used-tesla-model-s-sell-faster-and-for-more-money-than-peers-study-says-2017-04-12) seems to imply that Tesla resale value is good.

Tesla's full self driving isn't ready yet. So they just release bits and pieces of it as convenience features. Their ultimate goal is to just summon a car from anywhere like a taxi and have it take you to your destination.
Probably because it travels 1 mph.

It's also not available to be used with the key fob, only through the mobile app so it takes some time to initiate.

AutoPilot 2.0 is just now getting features the 1.0 version had years ago. Tesla needs to step up their game. GM is going to have a full self driving car long before Tesla at this rate."

Every one of those steps probably takes ten years of R&D and testing to be 'ready' to go to Mars, probably more"

The level of trust you would have to have to let your car drive people you don't know by itself. 
"That.... doesn‚Äôt sound like a good idea tbh. I mean why don‚Äôt you just leave your nice car unlocked in a bad neighborhood. Same thing. Except theres the extra possibility that someone could have potentially gotten into a wreck in your car too. Just because it self drives, doesn‚Äôt mean it would be impossible for a wreck. Especially if someone tried to use that system to steal it anyways. 
And best case scenario your car comes back smelling like god knows what... urine, feces, barf, terrible BO... you name it, its possible. And do you think you would actually get *paid* for this? Mmmm.... i would say at best the network that sets up the infrastructure would at the very least take a cut... and with the cost of gas, and increased cleaning because of humans being gross... you *might* break even. Maybe slightly more. I mean cmon, people don‚Äôt become millionaires being an uber driver. They‚Äôre people who also have a day job and need extra cash on the side. Poverty level guys... nah... not worth it for someone who can afford a Tesla in the first place. Just terrible idea. 
Oh oh... and what if your car gets stuck in traffic and doesn‚Äôt come back when you need to get to your next meeting/appointment and it causes you to be late? Yeah. "
Tesla demonstrated this at the end of last year's self driving video.  The car dropped him off at HQ then found a spot and parked.
"Audi has been working on this tech for years, and there's a pretty widely-circulated demo video.  It's not currently in production though."
"This is probably the new Audi A8, which will be the first level 3 car in the world. Goes on sale later this year in UK and US, and there are plenty of demo videos online of it by now. "
"You aren't alone. I too have a memory of BMW showing off a car exiting a parking structure and meeting the owner out front. Perhaps it was a different German manufacturer, but I swear I saw it."

Imagine that sort of price movement and watch for used Tesla cars in a few years. Be ready to pounce when you find one that is priced right and sell whatever you are driving at that point."

"The levels of autonomy in vehicles:

The A8 will be capable of total autonomous driving (with a driver there to intercede if necessary, but not required to actually pay attention) up to 37 MPH. And as mentioned in another comment I believe, it can park itself/pull out of spots via a phone app. Some super cool stuff."

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99WRokoBtXU

> The Tesla Model S with the Auto Pilot option includes the Summon feature, which brings the car out of or into a parking space while you're outside the car, controlling it with the key.

So the car gets itself out of a parking space potentially between two cars, avoiding driver interference that could easily cause a crash.

"You're confusing processes. Banks don't spend that man-hours on money transfer logistics, they spend it offering services like loans, savings, investment, etc. Believe me, getting the check for my mortgage loan was by far the easiest part in the whole process (2+ months of income verification, paperwork, house inspection, house appraisal, etc).  

Further, there is zero fraud proofs on blockchains. If I steal your identity and transfer all of your coins to another account, you'll never see them again and have no legal recourse. I thought MtGox would be the end of it but I'm always surprised by people's lack of knowledge or maybe over-optimism. "

"Banks' only ""service"" is to offer a secure place to store your wealth.  Loans, savings, investments, mortgages etc... are all a way for them make money offering that service.  A way to make money off of you, me, and everyone else, at everyone's expense.  Banks are basically a loan-shark.  Fractional reserve banking is a direct cause of inflation.  So even if you don't personally use a bank, you are still losing wealth due to inflation because everyone else uses one.

The blockchain has much better fraud-proofing, and is a more secure way to store your wealth - if you know what you are doing.  If you store your coins on an exchange like Mt. Gox then that is no different from using a bank.  If you store them securely, offline, in cold storage, with a strong password that you have memorized, then that is the most secure storage of assets in the world."
"100% agree on it being a new market with wild swings.  Its mostly new tech without any working products.  This is exactly why I said it is high risk high reward, do your research, invest what you can afford to loose.  No sane person on the planet should be all in on crypto but I also take some risk and having a small percentage in this incredibly interesting space is something I feel makes sense.  "
That's the cool part.  The car will get better as it ages.
"> Your original comment made it seem like it would valet it to you... 

Yes, because that's exactly what Tesla wants it to do, **eventually**. As of right now, the software is on Beta. That means they are only testing it, basically making sure it can get in and out of spots without crashing, before they put more advanced features into the market.

The end goal is to have it drive to you from any distance.

It actually says so on the official Tesla website:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/summon-your-tesla-your-phone

> During this Beta stage of Summon, we would like customers to become familiar with it on private property. Eventually, your Tesla will be able to drive anywhere across the country to meet you, charging itself along the way. It will sync with your calendar to know exactly when to arrive."

Now that's The Onion that we know and love. I've missed them since their political reporting has become to close to real news.
"i am never gonna drive again

carless feet have got no rhythm"
...I didn't realise that until I read your comment.
"And being electric, it would be silent, so 'Careless Whisper' would be a good name."
That‚Äôs what I read too... 3 times. Until I read your comment and then realized it said something else. 
"This was what I read multiple times, I didn't get the joke thinking ""isn't that what auto pilot is about?"". "
"I didn‚Äôt realize it wasn‚Äôt until I read your comment. I thought it was a legit thing where Teslas had cameras that kept track of where the driver was looking and utilized autonomous features or something and they were going to brag about saving people from accidents without them even realizing.   

It being a joke is super lame in comparison."
"And I'm never gonna drive again

My controls are set to, cruuu-uuuu-uuuuise"
"And now I hear George Michael singing ""careless driver"" in my head."
Move to Houston. We are already testing those!
We have a city full of those in Pittsburgh already. 
That‚Äôs just an orange 
"Other scrapped names for the project include

""Humans are dumb drivers""

""Cars drive not people.""

And 

""Sentient Flamethrowing Vehicles"" "
BMW already had those for decades. 
Come to Boston. 
Phht... already been invented and peprfected.
Did you mean Lexus drivers?
That project already launched years ago in Vancouver.
"We already have those but due to a production error, most of them live in California."
A few hours later and I still read it like that. And then I was like what are you talking about (you) lol.
Yeah it‚Äôs less funny when you have to stare at a headline now for ten minutes to determine whether it‚Äôs real or not
I thought it said that for the past 6 hours. Rip me 
"Pain is the whole truth, you'll find."
"Completely unsafe, definitely don‚Äôt buy one. Unless you like fun"
I read it as ‚Äúcaress driver‚Äù
"I read it 3 times and still saw careless up until I saw your comment. It‚Äôs past midnight, I should probably get to bed now..."
Ever driven in NJ or FL? Not fun. 
Nah careless drivers are a BMW thing
"Nothing new there, I come across those on a daily basis already."
So I'm never gonna drive again.
"Didn't even realise it wasn't ""careless"" till I read your comment. You're right, this is a little less funny."
That‚Äôs been done by everyone who blames Autopilot. 
"I thought it said ""crossdressing driver""."
"He already sold 10k Flamethrowers, how the f?"
He shitposts more than 16 year old trolls. And he‚Äôs running like 5 companies. It‚Äôs amazing 
"Red wine and Ambien... you're talkin' shit again

That‚Äôs potentially a very dangerous combo. He needs to get help.
Not only the past day or two. He has been like this for the past couple months.
Doesn't wine react with Ambien?
Omg I jut remembered how crazy can taking ambien and staying awake can be
He's probably just trying to distract himself from the anxiety over a successful falcon heavy launch.
My friend always decorates his room on ambien and wine

They're selling merch like hats and now flamethrowers as a way to raise funds."
"Gotta fund private projects somehow... I mean the guy is pretty much the real life tony stark, is it any surprise?"
reddit worships this guy so much it's hard for me to tell if you're being sarcastic or not
"Eh, I've met a lot of nerds who love him. Not too hard to believe that they don't pay Reddit. "
"You really underestimate the following Tesla has generated. It's a bit crazy, tbh. Elon Musk is every nerd/geek's dream of making it big and a large proportion of Redditors fall into that category."

I thought the flamethrower thing was satire 
"It's not really a flamethrower, more like a torch if anything."
"mainly because they aren't real flamethrowers, just torches in a plastic gun toy shape with a decently cool color scheme and logo."

Killer song right there
"For sure, I once had a major blackout from Ambien and vodka. 

The scary thing was it just started with a single ambien, but then I took another because the first one was euphoric, then I started drinking because I was still awake and by then all reason had gone out the window (I knew not to combine it with alcohol, but it really does fuck with your inhibitions like that). 

I woke up the next day and had finished an entire fifth of vodka and vomited most of it up. No memory of what happened that night. Thank god I didn't try to drive."
I agree! I'm happy to look after his ambien and wine stash while he's getting the help he needs.

And that is not to be confused with his attempt to learn the secrets of the human brain to upgrade them with machines so they can be used to confront a future hostile A.I.

And not to be confused with his attempt to sell roof tiles that hide a secret energy gathering system that can not be view from street level and appear as normal roof tiles to unsuspectin pedestrians walking by.

Also, it's not *really* a flamethrower, more like a sweet looking butane torch.  By definition a flamethrower has a 10+ ft long flame, this looks like a measly 4ft at most.

Told my girlfriend they‚Äôd have one at the century City Mall in LA after getting an email and we should go see it since my reservation number is (allegedly) coming up. Realized now it‚Äôd be a shit show for the first few week and might have to wait. Or maybe take a ‚Äúsick day‚Äù when the crowds won‚Äôt be there... /s
the new supreme
Weak. I‚Äôve had lines at least twice that size at chipotle. But it doesn‚Äôt take you 6 months to get your food if you order online
Which location is this?
Did the S or X have this kind of pull?
/u/110110 this thread is a disaster lol.
"Dear Elon Musk: I think you are a good person and an amazing human being. I am glad that you exist, and that you're puting all those hours and all that overtime into making kick-ass inventions for the human race. Thank you."
Man you should see the lines when we were waiting for the preorder on something we never even seen/touched. It was over 800 people in Corte Medera after 10am and I was 40th in line getting into it at 4am. Apple ironically released the iPhone SE that day and their line maybe had 10 people. Tesla and Apple store are directly across each other which made it ironical.
"It really is. Now, if they can only figure out the whole ""making money"" thing."
Dang I was gonna go but I don‚Äôt want to wait in line. The model 3 will probably be in more stores soon anyways.
Location? Store name? 
Wow
"For the haters. The caption is only about buying a product sight unseen and standing in a line wrapped around the store just to see a new product. 

I am in no way comparing the two companies or their different missions. "
Is there a way to find out when a store will get a model 3 to showcase? I've asked workers before but they never know 
[deleted]
First car I'm gonna buy will be a tesla.  Just gotta make 10x more gains in crypto and the dream will be a reality!
"Would love to hear updates on the line and times - does it look like it will continue to get longer throughout the day? Knew I should have gone yesterday before the mass email went out!
"
Those are some good lookin dogs.
This looks like Century City? Can you test drive them or just sit inside? I'm so excited regardless!
Funny thing is this store is just across a new apple store.
When the revolution happens all we gotta do is time it with Tesla release and they will round themselves up for us
[deleted]
"Some day I hope to be able  o afford to stand in this line...since I won‚Äôt be  able to afford the car itself, the line will do."
"I really love tesla. mostly because elon musk is an incredible person. teslas are incredible cars that have, without a doubt, given the EV revolution a huge boost."
/r/hailcorporate
Apple makes money. Shit tons of money. Tesla burns money. Shit tons of money.
"I can see it, starts off as an innovative company makes world changing technology and then eventually in about 7 years makes overpriced items where design is more important than engineering. "
"An even more expensive status symbol. Pardon the salt, I am simply broke."
"Apple was able to fix their supply chain issues. You can order and expect to receive it on launch day for the most part. Lines aren‚Äôt necessary for fans to get the thing they want.

Tesla has a severe supply strain that it‚Äôs worth it to line up for anything.

"
"I like tesla, but being compared to apple is never a good thing"
Except their new updates speed up the old cars. 
Except Apple actually has products you can leave the store with. 
Except Tesla's good.
Tesla actually innovates though.
"I fuckin hope not, Apple sells mediocre product for insane prices"
Can they make smart phones already? I can only imagine the epic battery life
I want to be the first man to fuck a Tesla automobile 
I spent around 2 hours in that line lol
Except their products are actually kinda good and not extremely overpriced. 
"As an upcoming graduate student how viable would it be for me to acquire the new tesla, I really want one and would probably keep it for at least 5-10 years? Any info on what purchase options are available with deposit."
[deleted]
Why is there a line now? Is it just a new store opening?
This comparison would be more apt if Tesla had anything more closely resembling competition.
No... Tesla... The first Tesla. 
"i want to know what the bottle neck is ? what is issue particularly ? i mean i follow news around pretty much but all i know is they have issue or bottleneck ...
does anyone know?"
"Did you know if the same marketing company works for both corporations?
Because the handwriting is the same!"
"Any idea when the model 3 will hit one of the Toronto showrooms?
"
"No. Apple didn't make it's name for quite some time after Microsoft. Tesla is the Microsoft if anything, but really it's neither.

Why do people always feel the need to make comparison like this?"
If Tesla is the Apple of electric cars what is the equivalent for Android?
I want one of them 3‚Äôs so bad. 
"I'd love a Tesla, but I don't have a garage."
Just money.....
For geezers with money.
Wait. What‚Äôs the line for? 
Or chick fil a :p
"Well Apple did have a good marketing strategy, they're basically exactly like every other corporation but convinced people they weren't.

They turned a product into an identity, and it worked."
I‚Äôd buy a Tesla phone.
Is Tesla going to make a coupe version of the model 3? 
"> The new Apple.

Far more profound than that.  Tesla *stores* may be the new Apple stores, but Tesla is something that doesn't necessarily have a prior analogy.  If Ford had taken over the oil and electricity industries, and simultaneously pursued air travel and urban design, that might come close to what Tesla is.

And I won't even get into what it looks like in the broader context of other Musk companies, because otherwise starry-eyed adulation is inevitable.  It's as if Arthur C. Clarke wrote these companies."
Rich people in the modern age. 
"Tesla= all the fun of Apple, plus real batteries! "
"Yeah, I'll take a Tesla phone."
Did someone say giveaway????
This kind of object worshipping is cringeworthy
"So does that mean that if I have a problem with my Tesla, some spotty teenager will try to sell me the latest model rather than fixing it? ;) "
The new Apple? Does that mean that they'll slow your car down after a few years because the battery's gotten old?
Tessa looks out for their customers best interest though. 
Love to see it 
That's insulting like comparing Tim Cook with Elon Musk.
Oh no! People gravitate towards things they like! The horror! 
$1K phones vs $100k cars... who will win?
Please don't say that. Don't ruin this for me.
Who are all those people with 100k to drop on cars??
It'll be trendy for 20 years until the evil but charismatic figurehead of the company dies and gets slowly overtaken by more traditional competitors again?
Can they make smart phones already? I can only imagine the epic battery life
Apple can actually meet there demand.
"Except they don't have dodgy business practices, don't sue everyone under the sun, don't steal ideas from Steve Wozniak, aren't an environmental disaster, and the product you buy is not outdated technology, and relatively bargainous"
"Im picking up mine today, I didn‚Äôt know it was such a big deal "
But look at the puppies !!!
Lol that‚Äôs my local Tesla Store at Westfields Century City. It‚Äôs really pretty and futuristic. 
Century City Mall! I was just there earlier today. Drove there in my Model 3 too so it was pretty surreal seeing people lined up to look at one.
I just sat in a model x today and HOLY FUCK MY ENTIRE LIFE HAS CHANGED. THERES SIX DIFFERENT WAYS JUST TO CLOSE THE DOOR. ITS FUCKING AMAZING AND I NEED ONE.
...a tongle so you can charge your tesla with your lightning cable... that takes 12 years to fully charge 
Its 31 people it‚Äôs not that good
"Well, perhaps in popularity and from a technological stand point then yes they are the new Apple. However, they need to be produce millions 10s of millions of cars to have the same consumer impact as Apple has. Also producing a car at mass scale is incredibly more difficult technologically and financially next to Apples $5 cost of production/unit phones. Go ahead and down vote me but the deciding factor is going to be their production capability. No I am not from Seeking Alpha, that site is trash made for dying men."
I wonder if they will ever decide to get into the phone business
I love the Tesla technology (ev capabilities) but I‚Äôm not a fan of the styling. I can‚Äôt wait for Mercedes or other german cars to make their own EV‚Äôs. 
The only difference is Apple stores tend to have alot more broke people kicking around in line.
"The new Apple for the wealthy, not the average consumer."
[deleted]
I'd buy a tesla phone tbh
Not
"Thats an insult to anyone who owns a Tesla. 

Tesla is a company that makes a state of the art product that treats it employees right and that so far, doesn't take advantage of it's customers. 

Apple just launched a phone that had the capabilities of a 5 year old Samsung phone for $1000. While simultaneously battling suits against them from their customers. Apple is no where near the level of Tesla."
It will be the new Apple when they too can sell 10 million units not a few thousand cars. Tesla Motors is not a serious player.
[deleted]
[deleted]
Except that Tesla is not an asshole-company
"Except Apple makes frivolous consumer products and Tesla aims to change our global energy infrastructure. And yes I'm aware they haven't done that yet. But, goals man, goals. "
"Except Tesla is actually innovative lol.

Edit: I actually like Apple. They just don't innovate. They're years behind the competition innovation-wise. "
Except Tesla is actually innovative.
cult
But Tesla aren't a devious company solely set to make money from people.
Crazy! Two-three hours to wait in line to see an ordinary car!
"And just like Apple they use software to reduce performance of their products. 

Disclaimer: every tech product does this to some degree or another, otherwise what would be the difference between their top tier line vs the bottom sku? The best example of this practice are printers "
"I was once in an airport where there was a Tesla exhibited and nobody cared. Everybody strode past, nobody cared. It was glorious."
"People that buy Teslas arent car lovers. They arr tech lovers. Gimme a 427 tri carb 450hp vette or some other muscle. I appreciate Tesla, but if i had the $ to spend, id buy me some pure gasoline burning power. Dont care how quick a Tesla is, its not the same. "
They're gonna be waiting for a long time 
I was mostly excited for a rare Triple Weiner sighting. I was disappointed.
Tesla is effectively the Apple of cars
Makes me happy that Tesla is going well because that money is also funding SpaceX. 
Great. Another line I can‚Äôt afford to be in
How could anyone hate on a Tesla?
If Tesla is the new Apple then who is the new Android or better yet who is the new Xiaomi?
This is at my mall
"Does this mean Tesla will slow your car as it gets older to ""save it's battery life""?"
Why would you ever want to compare yourself to apple... Apple is known for making overly expensive cheap products that intentionally break forcing you to buy a new one because you have already invested to much into their no third party system. 
"both overpriced, both constantly miss deadlines, both are founded by asshole con artists"
"Mmm no, Tesla actually innovates."
"Except there‚Äôs a world of a difference. Take Apple: charges 1000$ for a phone and then slows down the phone. Take Tesla: designs and builds state of the art electric car (model 3) for 30,000."
That's definitely not a compliment.
Except they actually innovate... 
Atleast they don't slow down your device without your knowledge
I‚Äôd love to see Elon‚Äôs take on making a smartphone. Prob end up being some Minority Report shit
Let‚Äôs hope their batteries last longer than a year.
"I hope not, I don't want to have to buy a dongle to drive my car"
But elon musk doesnt have cancer
Are they all waiting for their recalled Model X?
Tesla = the Apple of cars basically. Both super expensive and still something trendy lol
"Overpriced, a bit shit but fanboys falling out their arse?"
[deleted]
"So we should wait for the better, cheaper alternative to come out in a few years?   
#/s"
Tesla sells at a massive loss.
Apple invented lining up?
"Tesla. Don't use your brand reputation as a crutch.
Have good marketing and be innovative."
Except that Tesla's products are innovative and superior to their competition. 
That's a terrible title especially since the recent controversy. Does that mean Tesla will reduce the cars performance as the battery ages? 
Elon musk should start making phones now
Let's hope they don't slow down the older models.
Why are people jumping out of your building to kill themselves?
old white people. good to know i should stay away from this trash
So every year I have to throw it away and get a new one?
"I find the title offensive.

If they had said Tesla the new Steve Jobs, then cool.

Apple is a rat shit company with zero innovation. Steve is gone people, that Brand is dead."
Tesla doesnt sell overpriced horseshit tho
r/apple
"Are you f**king joking, thats the biggest insult you can give any battery operated device...Apple batteries are poor chinese quality..."
Let's hope Tesla doesn't become stagnant like apple.
"TBF Tesla is not nor ever could be the new Apple. Apple is leagues better in every aspect for what it makes. Tesla is..... in a word, a trend. It will pass and fade off into oblivion after musk says, i'm bored. "
"Indeed, both buyers are rich men who buy it because of the name."
"What, Tesla sucks now too?"
...for the 1%
Both are bourgeois shit? 
[removed]
so many millionaires in one space
These people are the opposite of green.  Most of them have a perfectly fine car.
"False, the CEO isn't a pseudo science whack job and reinvests profits into making an affordable device for the middle class instead of jacking up the price to make it more about status.

It is an insult to compare Tesla to apple"
"To be fair, neither have a headphone jack. ^^^this ^^^is ^^^sarcasm, ^^^by ^^^the ^^^way. "
"Look, it isn't Tesla that I hate.

It's the overhype and shitting on ""normal"" cars I can't stand.

Tesla is a beast of a car but some of the comments here worry me.

For example the interior of the Tesla is pretty bad but I've seen people say it's the best interior they have ever seen. Like what?"
I love this thread.
I like tesla and tolerate apple
How much overlap do you think exists???
So this is MY THREAD? GREAT! 
It.... smells of hot pockets and sadness.
I like Tesla (but think they have flaws) but dislike Apple. I have mixed feelings about this.
Well this thread is a pretty cringy circlejerk so it's not surprising.
"Hey I like Tesla but Apple, Apple can die horribly and I‚Äôll be there laughing"
[deleted]
To get two minutes in the Model 3. 
"To check out the Model 3, newly arrived at this store"
"To ask the only question anyone should be asking right now about the cars........

ARE THEY E.M.P PROOF?"
Some stupid fad that Elon musk is using to pump his his stock
"This is totally me. I'm not a car guy at all. I can't even change a flat tire (yeah I know I really need to learn).

But with Tesla? I watch videos on YouTube, I read reviews, I've gone to Tesla stores in malls just to sit in the cars, I drove 1.5 hours to look at a Model 3 and test drive it, and now I've put $1000 down for the ability to buy this car 12-18 MONTHS down the line. 

Tesla has taken someone who is clueless about cars and turned them into someone who actively tries to learn about their brand. "
[deleted]
"I've got news for you. I own a Model S, and sometimes after my wife is asleep, I go downstairs to the garage to sit in it. I've never done that with a new car before."
"I‚Äôve followed You You‚Äôs North America road trip daily - I particularly enjoyed his candor, non fanboy approach, and no BS. After all the challenges he faced with the 3 - he still believes its a BETTER car than the Model S or X. Wow. "
"I get the feeling.

I go out of my way to pass by Superchargers on the slim chance I may see a Model 3 stopped.  They are still unicorn status over here on the East Coast."
And all this with essentially no advertising.
"Happened when the Mazda Miata came out.

Also, people were flipping them for 100% a markup."
Waiting in line for any product is dumb.  Source:  I‚Äôve waited in line and always feel like I wasted part of my life. 
"Had one a couple of days in front of me while driving home. Fuck, in real they even look more sexier than on photographs.."
You should go to Ferrari headquarters sometime.    
"This leads leads to funny conversations where non-car people think something's innovative on a Tesla but it's only because they don't know cars. 

""The Model 3 has automatic dimming side view mirrors.  Amazing!"" Guess what, I had that on my 2002 BMW. 

""Tesla's are so safe. They even have this thing in the seatbelt where it tightens itself in an accident."" Well those seatbelt pre-tensioners are pretty much standard on new every car sold today.

"
Weirdly this enthusiasm doesn‚Äôt translate to their stock prices 
Lol that‚Äôs because Tesla can‚Äôt produce cars 
[deleted]
i see one daily in LA.. idk why people would go wait in a line lol
You're a mad man. I hope you enjoy it. üòÑ
"Well both the iPad and the iPhone where presented fully at keynotes before they were available for purchase, so unless you refused to look at those and avoid all the articles talking about it.   Model 3 had reservations before people had actually literally seen even a photo of it."
The big problem with this Apple analogy is that 85% of the world use Android and Apple's OS is lagging far behind. 
"I was in line next to someone that didn't have a Tesla or reservation, but decided to check it out just because of the buzz. "
No chance of me being able to afford one. But I'd wait in line to see it. 
Ouch...

"I'm wondering if the lines will actually be better during work hours or there are still going to be lines of ""sick day"" fans. "
If you can afford one you probably don't need to worry about pulling the odd sicky!
Give yourself about an hour. You'll have time.
"Yeah, but riding in a Tesla will make you shit your pants the same way, too."
"Century city. I‚Äôm here now as well. The line is wrapped around the store.
EDIT: an hour and a half later I‚Äôm still in line. The line itself continues to grow and there is now a pretty big buzz from the general public walking by. Pretty much every passerby is stopping to see what the commotion is about. "
Lol
"It's fun to see the landscape changing, for some reason it makes me remember how far we have come [from](https://i.imgur.com/oc2EDhE.jpg?fb) and [this.](https://i.imgur.com/YpsPXwy.gif)

Not a win fanboy, but this one always cracks me [up.](http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/51a7804d6bb3f7ac6e000014-1190-625/microsoft-invented-a-tablet-a-decade-before-apple-and-totally-blew-it.jpg)

Classic windows to flub that one."
"Do you mean the iPhone SE? It came out March 31st, 2016."
Yeah in Corte Madera Tesla and Apple are right across from each other (like 15 feet) also a Microsoft store nearby
It took Amazon like a decade or so to make a profit. They are reinvesting any revenue.
"This might top the list as ""the most go to comment of the century"""
Shit that's a lofty goal when they can barely manage to service their debt
"R&D, kid, R&D will pay off exponentially."
Or just wait a week or so.
Century City
"Maybe you could have compared it to people waiting in line outside of Walmart on black Friday to buy a cheap TV /s. 

(I was in line at Palo Alto last night) "
Hasn't there always been a press briefing before every iPhone release?  I don't think any have be available for official pre-order before the unveil.
"Too late , you suck. "
"No, and all the people asking *really* annoys them. üòâ"
"Afaik Tesla batteries age pretty darn well. There are ""old"" presentations/lectures by professor Jeff Dahn floating around on YouTube if you care to dig into the details. Even though those are years old now, the science was already impressive.

Power throughput is definitely a function of available capacity and it could get throttled with age, but I don't expect by much. It also gets throttled temporarily for cooling purposes if you draw a lot over a short period of time."
Don't forget the weed stocks!
go forth my shitcoin make me rich
Oh nice you should be able to order it around March then. /s
Whatcha got? 
Just buy tesla stock according to this sub 
"They are now longer than a couple hours ago. They setup additional barriers to direct traffic outside the store. 
https://imgur.com/a/FYAiQ"
Just sit
And the same guy who designed the Apple store also designed the Tesla stores.
"Ah, Apple has had their misses and blown deadlines. And Apple certainly went through tough times too."
Wasn't always that way for Apple.
?!? The model 3 is the cheapest tesla
Being compared to one of the most successful companies is never a good thing? Wtf?
"...really? Apple is incredibly good at selling things, marketing, and to a certain extent design. Tesla sells cars in ways straight out of Apple's playbook at least compared to traditional auto manufacturers so regardless it's a pretty fair comparison."
"Bruh, you can leave the store with a Tesla hoodie. Wut u talkin about?"
"Apple *is* a very good company, it‚Äôs incredibly ignorant to say otherwise, they profit insane amounts of money, have an extremely loyal user base, 95+% of the current customers say they love their products. 

It would also be ignorant to say Samsung/Google etc... aren‚Äôt good companies. They all make incredibly good products and all profit and all have huge success. 

Stop your fanboyism. "
"At least Apple has some respect for privacy. 

Google‚Äôs business model is about knowing everything about you and profiting thru ads. Apple is primarily a consumer electronics company whereas the majority of Google‚Äôs revenue is from selling ads.  

Same goes for Facebook."
Apple knows they can get away with it because they have a blind cult following that will do anything. Its ridiculous! 
Flip mediocre and insane and now we got tesla
Why? They make one phone related battery thing now and it's a shitty amount of battery life per $.
"Sorry to inform you of this but it has almost certainly already been done, in one way or another.  But you can be the first one to fuck your very own Tesla if you are lucky.  "
How was the experience???
[deleted]
"You'll need to figure a few things out first. What's your stipend? How much of that stipend will go toward living expenses? Unfortunately, I've never heard of any grad student making over $30,000 and I would never recommend getting a car more than your annual salary. r/personalfinance is a great resource"
"Dude, you're at least 12-18 months away even if you put down a deposit now.  "
"Wait until it's in full production and there's no line, then buy it. Put the thousand to good use in the mean time. If you want to feel invested in the brand, buy a keyring, or even buy some shares."
"Nah, get a Honda/Toyota

Unless you start off making $150k+, I would still try to get a used Model 3"
"This is a bad idea. Too many unknowns everywhere. Will you need to travel? Will the car be reliable? It would take you at least 5 years to pay it off, unless your making a lot more money than the average in your situation. Hope this doesn‚Äôt sound condescending. "
I wouldn‚Äôt consider 2 minutes sitting in a Tesla worth the wait
A couple stores now have the Model 3 on display
What kind of idiot would crash their brand new car into a showroom
Chevy Bolt / Nissan Leaf
"At the moment, we don't yet know. Likely a Chinese brand eventually. The analogy only holds up so much. At the moment, Tesla is looking at over 50% of the capacity to make battery electric vehicles outside of China in the next few years. That advantage might last far into the 2020's. The comparison with Apple is probably more apt to be 2000/2001, at the start of the iPod than the 2017 Apple. Or maybe the Apple Macintosh in 1984.
"
Waymo?
"Don't think about it that way. Phone industry is different than cars. Do your own research and compare. Don't be misguided. BTW , in my humble opinion. Don't get the model 3 . wait until the next generation. "
"They'll probably have self-driving taxis in a few years, so no worries."
"They're waiting to test drive the Model 3 for 2 minutes. They've got 400,000 preorders but almost none of the reservation holders have driven the car yet so everyone with a reservation wants to try the car out."
"No news on that yet, but my guess is no (at least not in the next 5 years). After the Model 3, they'll release the Tesla Semi, then the roadster, then the Model Y, then Tesla pickup. That will probably take us to 2022 or 2023. "
They are there to see the Model 3 that will start at $35k
"As is tradition. :(  

Hope that it'll take longer rather than shorter than that."
and spell I am guessing
No bad practices for its workers at all. No quality issues at all. Nothing trying to influence reviewers. Nope
">don‚Äôt steal ideas from Steve Wozniak

Apple stealing ideas from Apple‚Äôs cofounder?"
"> Except they don't have dodgy business practices
  
Oh, you mean aside from switching out the premium headliner material to the same stuff used in a Kia Optima without any notification to the customers?"
"You could get your car for free by charging people for a viewing!

"
Pretty sure there's a corgi. I love corgis. My little potato is laying by me.
Why is that a good thing? Serious question. 
"Also, the switch to smart phone from flip phone in an obvious one. Consumer cost goes up, but that is the only negative. You gain everywhere else. That‚Äôs not true with a electric vehicle vs a gas/diesel/hybrid vehicle. An electric vehicle doesn‚Äôt have a place in every home. A smart phone does. "
"> However, they need to be produce millions 10s of millions of cars to have the same consumer impact as Apple has.

While Apple's goal is obviously to dominate their industry, Tesla's is not.  Tesla's goal is ""to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible"".  So completing that goal, even if people aren't buying their EVs is a pretty large consumer impact"
I think Tesla will be in big trouble once that happens. They won't be able to match the build quality of the Germans. 
The base price is less than the average new car sale price.
Rofl what a dumbass comment 
Shouldn't you be supporting the success of the free market?
Talking about the line around store and buying a product sight unseen. 
"Technically, Tesla just launched a car that has the capability of 30 year old Civic, still can't deliver on AP and other things they already sold, and just took two years to deliver a feature literally every other car has had without issue for decades.

I""m a Tesla fan but damn... Tesla isn't 1/5th of Apple yet, they are just now on the cusp of doing to cars what Apple did to phones a decade ago."
Apple phones still are missing the arson feature Samsung is well know for.
You've clearly never sat in one
">affordable price 

lol"
Apple pretty single handedly started the personal computer revolution and also the smartphone revolution. I think that deserves some credit.
"Yeah, a car with Bioweapon Defense and Ludicrous Modes is totally non-frivolous"
Lol. The irony of this
"People keep saying this, but what is there to innovate on the phone now? I don‚Äôt want any more shit on my phone lol. They innovated the entire smart phone sector into what it is now! Everything looks like the iPhone. Old women call all phones iPhones like they call all video games Nintendo. What has Tesla done that‚Äôs so over the top? 
There is a large chance still that a top automaker, or multiple, end up owning the electric market for cars and Tesla doesn‚Äôt even survive. "
Correction: Apple doesn‚Äôt innovate since Steve jobs died 
Cult of fun cars to drive?
"Yeah they‚Äôre clearly a charity, that‚Äôs why their cars are free!"
You like it when people don't care about sustainable transport? Or was it the location that irked you?
I‚Äôd take an old fashioned mustang over any vette. The smell of fresh manure...going off-road...saddle sores and all. Yee-haw!
"As someone who drives a 650hp 427 Vette, get the fuck out of here with that attitude. /r/gatekeeping is that way. "
Different type of excitement. Maybe it tickles a different part of the brain. I can appreciate both.
[removed]
Tesla is the iPhone of cars. 
"Nope, they are separate companies and Musk cannot just move money from one pot labelled ""Tesla"" to another pot labelled ""SpaceX"". That would get him in serious legal trouble.

Besides, even if you could, then movement in OTHER direction would be more needed."
"I‚Äôll answer you question, but first you have to tell me who the old Xiamen is? "
How original. Did you not notice the same Apple haters post the same thing in like every other comment?
Just tell us who hurt you. 
Yeah starting a company that lowered the cost of access to space and disrupted the whole launch industry definitely means con artist. 
[deleted]
IIRC Tesla actually upgraded batteries at no charge for a period to help people leave Florida during the last hurricane...
What is that supposed to mean?
"There are no better cheaper alternatives coming for at least 3 years, and probably longer. No one apart from Tesla and a couple companies in China are building the battery factories that will be needed to mass produce electric cars. Tesla will be the only serious game in town for the next 3 years at least. The only other big company with plans to mass produce electric cars is Volkswagen. "
This is a big myth. Tesla has a gross margin of 20-30% on Model S and X (and will probably have a similar margin on Model 3). The reason they're not profitable is because they put all that money and then some back into expansion (Gigafactories are not cheap).
What's wrong with old white people?
Actually in some countries like Norway it is a lot cheaper then gasoline cars because of government incentives and the taxes on gasoline cars
"The base price is less than the average new car sale price.

Tesla's explicit goal is to move towards and accelerate mass adoption of EVs and thus the transition to sustainable transport. That they started with high priced cars is a matter of circumstance of new companies as well as the technology, not a matter of policy."
35K is hardly outside the budget for a middle class income.
"One is trying to mass market EVs, with the explicit goals of lowering the price as much as possible, in order to accelerate wide-reaching adoption and thus transition to sustainable energy consumption in transport. There are some similarities in design philosophy and brand recognition, but other than that they aren't that similar.

Also, Tesla has a policy of not making a profit on service, while Apple charges exorbitant prices.

So the short answer is: No. Maybe temporarily, but not as a goal."

"As a complete Tesla fan who loves Tesla and thinks they're going to change the world, they need a new interior design guy."
It's Tesla's horrendous labour practices that have me not getting on board the hype train. As well as Elon's arrogance in responding to the urban transport expert on Twitter.
It's ridiculous and funny. Some even have the balls to compare the model X to and ranger rover for off road capability. Saying they are both SUVs
"Rogue One and Avengers are pretty bad movies but i see plenty of people on Reddit saying they‚Äôre the best movies they‚Äôve ever seen

So as with Tesla interiors, maybe they‚Äôve seen very few movies/interiors and they were all worse, or maybe they simply have bad taste in an inherently subjective area "
"I could agree for the S and X (they need a refresh).  But the model 3 does have something special.  People from the car industry also agree, you can read the review from Alex Roy for example.

You might not like it, but many elements are very cool and beautiful.  The single vent, the uninterrupted lines that goes from one side the the other and the touch screen (which is by far the best and most beautiful touchscreen put in any production car).  This is definitely minimalist design, but plenty of people love this.  After having experiencing it, all materials feel great also.

It looks very similar to older car interior design (where only the essential was there), which is great in my opinion.

Having more knobs and buttons has been a sign of luxury for the last few decades, but it is not better in design.  It looks a lot like the transformation phones had: simple -> complicated with dozens of other buttons that you rarely use -> simple.

Also let's not kid ourselves, every modern screen and touchscreen present in modern cars feel cheap and almost like children toys.  And so those the poor software accompanying those screens.  People rarely talk about it, but the trend of adding bad screen/touchscreen in cars just made the interior look cheap.

Most of current car interior design are designed for men and thus have very masculine interiors.  The model 3 is very neutral in that respect and will please a part of the population often ignored in the car industry.

Is the model 3 interior perfect.  Nooo.  Is it bad?  Imho, it's one of the best steps in modern auto history in term of interior design.  I love great feeling knobs and buttons (and watches are a personal favourite).  But the auto industry has overused them in recent years.

That's my personal opinion.  But I'm pretty sure plenty of people feel similarly."
When I got my car towed awhile ago I was talking to the tow truck driver and he told me that Tesla‚Äôs have a lot of battery problems and he tows those shoes more than anything.

"It‚Äôs pretty simple:

1.	If it‚Äôs a Tesla, don‚Äôt bother. Call for roadside assistance. 
2.	Apply the parking brake and loosen the lugnuts before jacking up the car. 
3.	Take the spare jack out of the boot and jack up your car (there‚Äôs often arrows pointing to where to do this near the bottom of your base trim, you‚Äôll want to do it somewhere that looks strong. Typically there‚Äôs a spot where all the metal comes together, Tesla‚Äôs might be different).
4.	Take the wrench that should also be in the boot, unscrew all the lugnuts, remove the wheel. 
5.	Replace the wheel with a spare, then tighten the lugnuts in a star pattern (do the one across from the one you just did) until you can‚Äôt easily turn.
6.	Repeat until you can‚Äôt tighten them anymore with a decent amount of force. Remove the jack, and put everything back in the boot. 


Now you‚Äôve changed a tire!

Edit: added some info I forgot (naturally) when typing it out. "
Good news for you! If you buy a Tesla it won't come with a spare so you have no need to learn!
How were you able to test drive a model 3? Was this at a Tesla event?
"Me too. Minus the $1000 part. But I do intend to own one, one day."
Same. I bought a Honda Fit in '09 and thought I'd never care to get anything else. Pricey cars were for suckers. Just not a 'car guy.' Now I own a Model X...
"I was super excited about the model s long before it was manufactured. Still think it's a great car. Sat in the model 3 at a local auto show a couple weekends ago and was thoroughly disappointed in the emptiness, blandness, *yawn* feeling. Felt like it had no personality and was a premium Prius. Can't see why 60k is worth it for the model 3, so many more fun cars available at that price including used model S! Anyway, maybe a used model 3 in the 20s would grab my attention."
it's cause it took cars and made it appealing to tech geeks
What is it that you love so much?
"Sounds like you still don't care about cars, more so innovation and technology. "
The people making them are clueless about cars as well
Just remember you don't have a spare tire anyway. Not something you have to learn. Call a Ranger!
"I put $1k about 10 months ago and I‚Äôve never been in a Tesla. There are 7 model s in my neighborhood including 2 ugly ass Model X though. So I would fit right in with my poor man‚Äôs model 3. 
For me it is all about the safety factor. I drive a gas guzzling car now so it would be nice to skip the gas station every Sunday night. My estimate says late 2018 so we‚Äôll see when I actually can order mine. "

"It's not really enough to compare it to Amazon. You can compare any business that operates at a loss to Amazon, and claim that they are reinvesting, despite the fact that Amazon didn't dilute shareholders after IPO as far as I know. Other differences include that making cars is very capital intensive, whereas selling books over the internet is an intentionally capital-light model. And the other difference is that we only really know that Amazon is hugely profitable in retrospect, and we don't know the same for Tesla. The term ""structurally unprofitable"" has been thrown around, and if you look at the financials, notably declining margins, and SG&A growing exponentially, it's hard to disagree.

That being said, if Tesla can scale to making millions of cars per year, it is possible that they could be profitable, maybe very profitable. That is a long ways off and it will require continuous equity dilution along the way to pay for operating costs, debt service, and a huge amount of Capital Expenditures needed to scale to that point. Can they do it? That's the million dollar question."
Something something free cash flow.

Don‚Äôt forget the wheel lock socket if your car has it.
Except on a tesla... then you just call a tow truck because you might puncture the batteries if you jack it up wrong.
Or you buy a brand new expensive car (like a Tesla) and then when you break down you remember they all remove the spare tyre because of fuel (or battery) enconomy :) problem solved
"Also, don‚Äôt go under the car when using the jack that comes with it. "
"what? no, you say ""please call roadside assistance"" out loud. The car calls customer service, who sends someone to do that for you. "
You're not actually supposed to change your own tire on a tesla because they don't trust you not to puncture the battery and cause a huge fire. 
Eh I'll just wait and see if it happens then youtube it if I need to.
Where is the boot?
Although I think if you do that on a Tesla they void your warranty then seize the car.
"The fact that you forgot about the parking brake and loosening the bolts before jacking underscores that you might not want to change a flat yourself if you haven't at least watched a YouTube video on how to do it.

And for Tesla, the battery pack ""looks strong"" but should absolutely be avoided. And the car is heavy enough to require a beefier jack than the typical scissor jacks people buy for their cars.

The fact that you're giving this as a plus from the customer perspective is depressing. 
They've got some good margins bc of the people in those lines indeed
"Pretty sure both of your numbers are a bit off, yeah there are plenty android manufacturers who sell with very slim margins but in first world countries many tend to buy flagship devices from Samsung, LG, HTC and what not which have fairly similar profit margins to the iPhone... So overall I believe both market share and profits are much less sided for Android and iOS although market share is definitely higher for the former.

Another thing is that people tend to keep using a more expensive phone, like an iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy, for longer whereas less pricy phones may be more readily replaced to get a new one sooner."
Pretty easy to achieve that when the cheapest model for your phone is like 900. There are a ton of androids below 500 and Samsung is probably the only company with 1k Android phones. 
I'm not talking about Apple. I'm talking about Tesla. Now if Tesla could get 0.0000090% profit share today that would be great.

I have to configure so i went. Dont go. It took 1hr 50mins. They gave me 1 min in the driver seat and my partner 1 min. This was forced and they required 1 min if a couple even if you didnt want to switch. You could do a whole 2 mins if alone.
"I don‚Äôt disagree with your argument necessarily, but do have to correct one small portion of your rationale. Amazon is not massively profitable. Margins are very slim, relative to other retail companies. This is purposeful, as Amazon likes to pass the value on to customers in the form of lower prices rather than retain them as profits. 

Additionally, ‚Äúselling books over the Internet‚Äù is a massive oversimplification. Yes, Tesla has manufacturing overhead, but Amazon also has just as much. Think about the massive fulfillment centers, all the employees picking and packing your orders, the robots, the delivery trucks, etc.  

Amazon loses money on lots of orders, but on a holistic basis, it‚Äôs profitable. Without their scale, it wouldn‚Äôt work at all. That‚Äôs where I agree with you completely. If Tesla ramps to scale (like Amazon was able to) they look like geniuses. If they can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs a massive waste. "

It's not a cheap car, but statistics would suggest that it is affordable to most."

Both companies are doing very important things for human progress. I don't get why so many Tesla/Elon fans insist on making this a contest. They're not even competitors (at the moment).
"Energy infrastructure is super important. automotive is a fraction of global energy use and emissions.

Tesla as a battery business is promising but that's not what anyone's really excited about. They want a fast car. 
"
"The definition of a Tesla fanboy is someone who believes that Tesla is a first mover in any energy infrastructure sub-industry (the batteries are from Panasonic and Samsung, other people make solar panels, solar roof tiles have been sold since 2005, and even home battery packs are made by others, AI is booming all over and Tesla is a minor player) Musk wants you to believe he is an innovator and genius - he‚Äôs just the guy who was able to leverage his Silicon Valley fundraising clout to put a viable all electric vehicle into production - admirable no doubt, but everything that is cool about Tesla EVs will be also available in other cool EVs. Tesla isn‚Äôt Apple. Musk is no Steve Jobs."
You can't engineer all those things without personal computers and the software used to create those designs.

"Do you seriously think SpaceX has had no effect whats so ever? If your thinking of PSLV, that's not a good argument. PSLV is small vehicle compared to Falcon 9 when you look at the mass to orbit numbers. So no shit its cheaper. "

You realize many new cars in general are around 30-35k right?

"Why is he downvoted? Of course aesthetic preference is subjective. While I like the minimalist interior of the model 3, /u/wcg doesn't. Is one of us wrong? No, we just like different things."
"> Elon who I think is the most overworked billionaire.


Never trust a billionaire when they tell you how many hours a week they work, they're always lying."
Where did you find plastic in the model 3?  Have you been inside?
"There are buttons on the steering wheel which feel great.  Tesla should let those do more (which they can with their OTA updates).

There are not a lot of true reviews out there, since no review site had the car yet.  Many are just publishing articles without having set foot inside the car.

If you have the chance, get in the car.  It doesn‚Äôt feel plastic at all.  Surfaces are a mix of vegan leather, aluminium, alcantara, and a soft textile.  Everything feels soft and comfy.  There‚Äôs a lot of false informations and impressions going on around this car, just try it to make your own mind.  But in my opinion this is one of the most important interior car design in a long time."
"You sound like someone who‚Äôs never spent any time in a Tesla. I have purchased two. The difference in quality has changed significantly over the past four years. I own other luxury cars and other than not having a bunch of stupid buttons, I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre referring to when you say it‚Äôs ‚Äúpretty bad.‚Äù

Edit: Holy shit, my suspicions are right. Ignorant. You are considering buying a 1986 Toyota Supra and are calling a Tesla Model S interior ‚Äúpretty bad.‚Äù I bet you consider yourself a ‚Äúcar guy,‚Äù huh?"
"That‚Äôs apples and oranges. What‚Äôs a similar performance electric vehicle in this price range that you can compare it to? 

I think if you‚Äôre comparing to standard vehicles in this price range you can say they have better interiors but they don‚Äôt compete in the same categories.

Edit: how is this controversial? Lol never change reddit."

"Of course you can probably just wait a week or two until the initial hype about the car being in the showroom dies down, then go sit in it without the wait in line."
I enjoyed it. Plus you had a bunch of Tesla employees there to answer any of your questions. 
Not worth standing in line for is a pretty strong negative review already. 
"With a Model S or X you are paying a very high price for a premium vehicle with great tech. With a Model 3 you are paying a high price for an economy car with great tech.  Optioned up its a very expensive Corolla. I just wasn‚Äôt impressed with the interior. 

The interface on the tablet was just fine. I‚Äôve seen complaints on that but I had no issue. Found everything on it quickly that I looked for. 

Were some build quality issues but hopefully those get resolved when production is really rolling. It was things like panel gap consistency and rear lights weren‚Äôt flush and were a little off. 

I just think Tesla would have a hard time with this car in a mass market once the hype dies down. But I very well may be wrong. It‚Äôs just that competition is coming and consumers want ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù not the coolest at a premium price on something like this. "
"Minimalism is good, but stripping everything (especially needed features) for the sake of looking clean is stupid.  The iphone only needed 1 button, the model 3 doesn't only need a single display, it needs more for it not to be a pain to navigate through."
"Seriously all these people complaining just want to be driving a blackberry around for the rest of their lives because that‚Äôs how it was growing up and they liked it. 

I liked my iPhone when I first got it. "
No.  I've driven one.  It's lacking.
"You dont understand it seems.. the whole theme of the design is lacking in essence.

Compare the Model 3 (lazy name) to a similar model Mercedes-Benz or Audi an you ought to see the point."
"Do you see the picture?? All of these people obviously just were walking by and thought it looked cool so they wanted to check it out, I guarantee you none of them are planning to buy a model 3 (especially after they see the interior).  Also you call me a retard and you have shit grammar lmao..."

"Also don‚Äôt forget the parking break before jacking it up.

"
And also tighten them a bit more after lowering the car off of the jack (unless you like having your wheel fall off while driving at highway speeds...)
"the reason for this is when you try to turn the wrench and the wheel is just sitting in the air, your effort ends up spinning the wheel instead. "
And if you have trouble doing so... a tip to do so is by pulling the wrench up. More force than if you try by pushing it down with your body weight.
I saw another thread where a guy recommended going to a junkyard and grabbing an old donut spare. Apparently they almost can't give them away.
With what spare wheel would you change it with? 
"No, its because you can't jack the car up anyway because of the fear you do it improperly and puncture a battery."
"Why do some people spell tire as ""Tyre""?
Is this a foreign way?"
To be fair many new cars don't come with spare tires anymore.  You either get a choice between RFT or some flat tire inflator kit.
"I‚Äôve changed many a tire in my time, I just forgot a couple of facts when I was typing it out. Also, this was more geared towards an ICE, not a Tesla and I even indicated that I‚Äôm not sure how it would go on a Tesla. In any case, I‚Äôve updated my post. You weren‚Äôt the first, second, or even third person to tell me I missed a few things. "
"I‚Äôll also add this tip, as someone who has had to change a tire before with no prior experience: keep a rubber mallet in your trunk too. Sometimes the lugnuts don‚Äôt want to ‚Äústart‚Äù or break loose, and while you can kick/stomp the wrench to help, you might hurt your foot or somehow knock the car off balance on the jack. Much easier and safer to buy a cheap rubber mallet, toss it in there, and forget about it until you need it."
"Obviously. Generally when you get a flat you just need to get a working one on long enough to get you home or to a shop, which is what my instructions were designed for. However, hand tight is usually tighter than some dude in a shop with an air wrench. "
Did he pay for dinner?

From [Tesla's blog](https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you)


> Yesterday, there was a wall of Tesla patents in the lobby of our Palo Alto headquarters. That is no longer the case. They have been removed, in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology.

> Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport. If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal. Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology.

> When I started out with my first company, Zip2, I thought patents were a good thing and worked hard to obtain them. And maybe they were good long ago, but too often these days they serve merely to stifle progress, entrench the positions of giant corporations and enrich those in the legal profession, rather than the actual inventors. After Zip2, when I realized that receiving a patent really just meant that you bought a lottery ticket to a lawsuit, I avoided them whenever possible.

> At Tesla, however, we felt compelled to create patents out of concern that the big car companies would copy our technology and then use their massive manufacturing, sales and marketing power to overwhelm Tesla. We couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong. The unfortunate reality is the opposite: electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn‚Äôt burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales.

> At best, the large automakers are producing electric cars with limited range in limited volume. Some produce no zero emission cars at all.

> Given that annual new vehicle production is approaching 100 million per year and the global fleet is approximately 2 billion cars, it is impossible for Tesla to build electric cars fast enough to address the carbon crisis. By the same token, it means the market is enormous. **Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world‚Äôs factories every day.**
> 
> We believe that Tesla, other companies making electric cars, and the world would all benefit from a common, rapidly-evolving technology platform. 
> 
> Technology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world‚Äôs most talented engineers. We believe that applying the open source philosophy to our patents will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla‚Äôs position in this regard."
">Then like most Tesla fanboys, you don‚Äôt know much about cars.  
  
Is that really what you got out of his comment?  Is it really so far fetched for an average person to think a battery would be relatively inexpensive to replace?"
"Is it really necessary to be so rude?

Also it's completely fair to compare the battery with an engine. The drive units are lightweight, inexpensive, and relatively easy to replace. The battery is huge, heavy, and not so easy to replace."
"Yeah for now, only because you have to take it to a special shop to get it serviced. And I‚Äôm not a Tesla fanboy, I would never buy one because of the stupid touch screen instead of regular buttons."

"It might be for those in the market for a First Hand new car, but I know very few people who can manage that without stretching their financial limits on monthly leases etc. I've never had a 'New Car' myself.

People would do anything just to say they were first
The only ones being delivered now are they very expensive the optioned ones. It will be that way for quite some time. And and if you want to add any options to the car at all quickly adds massive amounts to the price
"Tesla won't get there if they keep doing what they do. They keep hanging on to classic batteries and refuse to invest in technologies like liquid hydrogen and super capacitors, which other manufacturers do. Electric cars aren't new and in that respect I do find the Apple analogy very fitting. They didn't innovate, but they made it popular."

You think Tesla is the first to make an electric car?
Depends on your view on the role of company policy.
"It's not that they didn't want to, they are all doing it now... it's that they weren't able to because it would be cannibalism, so yes definitely not able to, just not because of engineering but because they couldn't afford it."
"And then promptly recalled and crushed all of them out of existence months later...

And it's not like they were selling the crap out of them."
I agree but Steve Jobs and Apple often get touted as the benchmark for success. Which i think they deserve but to a much lesser extent.
Transportation is a fairly large part of human emissions.   But I agree no one really cares about Tesla's battery production.
"Actually, the gigafactory has gotten a lot of attention."
"There's a lot of hype around Musk I agree, but surely you must think some of it is deserved.  Especially if you hold Steve Jobs and Apple in so high of a regard.  

And Tesla is involved with Li-Ion batteries are they not? Partnered with Panasonic to build the worlds largest battery plant? 

Solar City(now tesla) is the US' largest installer of Solar Panels by far.

Your point about Tesla EVs being as cool as other EV's is spot on. But it also applies to Apple products, now more than ever.  Maybe I just don't know enough about apple?  What have they done that hasn't also been done by other companies?"
I don't think Apple is solely responsible for the rise of all software and computers that our civilisation uses. I think computers were a natural scientific progression that would have inevitably happened.  Kind of like electric motors naturally replacing ICE's

The Model 3 does have USB-C.  Mine has two to be exact. 
"Everyone's thinking iPhone, but if you just talking about Apple, you could be talking about the MacBook which has a USB C port(s).

Yes, I know iPhone was implied from the headphone jack comment but people like to be pedantic."
"""still""? Almost every other smartphone uses mini usb, which is worse than lightning. Yes, it's way more compatible because everyone uses it, but it sucks. Lightning is better, and that's also why they stopped using headphone jacks. Sure, it's annoying as fuck now, but they have always done the step into the future before it was comfortable, they basically made USB the standard it is now. And you don't wanna tell me you still want different connectors for different things in the future? Ideally, everything can connect with the same thing, and in 99% of the cases, that connection is wireless. Apple forces you to use lightning or wireless. One day, the next step will be done as well, no physical connectors anymore.

Like I said, annoying as fuck right now, but as practical as aux is, it is outdated, and we have to start moving on *somewhere*. 

Sorry, I kinda drifted away with the subject, and even my initial subject was going crazy about you saying ""still"".... my bad, I'm an asshole sometimes, I apologize"
Acutally iPhones now have Lightning AND the Qi wireless charging standard. So technically this is the first time iPhone's have an industry standard charging method! (Though I suppose you can argue in the early days of iPods and iPhones that the 30 pin connector was the industry standard given that those devices were dominating the market)
I'm actually curious how long that would take.
I'm not sure if having a charger that is compatible with smartphones and cars at the same time is a good idea at all.

"They compete at the same price which is what matters. If you have $40k or $70k to spend you are going to look at cars in that range and that includes gas and electric vehicles. For some the electric drivetrain is a big plus while for others the cheaper interior is a deal breaker. People aren't wrong to dislike Tesla's interior and compare it to Mercedes, BMWs, Audi ect.. Like others said Tesla had to cut costs somewhere to cover the much more expensive drivetrain and the interior is an easy place to do so. Likely as Tesla's manufacturing matures and profit starts going up or just less reinvesting they will update the interior and make it more competitive."
"How come? It might feel great but I wouldn't wait in line to by any car, car is just a car you know..."
"> It‚Äôs just that competition is coming

Please point me in the direction of a car that ticks/will tick all the boxes the Model 3 does at that pricepoint. Seriously.

The closest that I can think of is a Nissan Leaf 2018. Shorter range due to the 40kWh battery, max 50kW fast charging, starting at 33 000 euro... Even the base Model 3 without any options is a better buy at that price point.

When the Hyundai Ioniq gets its bigger battery it might be an option but price is unknown.

I truly wish there was more competition and rather sooner than later because the real competition is ICE vs EV, not EV vs EV."

"My 3 is absolutely perfect for bodywork (and believe me I looked, my wife looked and six guys from Tesla looked (was the first AZ customer delivery).

Ignoring the all electric (or assuming MB had the same powertrain), the Tesla isn‚Äôt designed to be a maintenance revenue stream, is a sportier ride (S/X included), is automated without losing control (except AP, which I don‚Äôt trust) and is human.

Examples. The S wins on the seat shaped adjustment control, then ruins it with the 1,2,3 set buttons. Tesla uses my name (it would be better with a phone/key sensor admittedly). The S has the old man clock - why?! It‚Äôs a nit, but completely duplicative and a carry over from the 300SD I borrowed from my dad.

Maybe that‚Äôs it. It feels like an *old* car with modern updates. The MB S feels bulky, as does the S/X, although the low center of mass helps a lot. The 3 is a go kart that I can drive to the theatre and take the kids to school in. The MB S is a lumbering hulk in a tux. And, my god, could they put in more buttons in more clusters?

To each his own. While the A/C/E class would be more comparable to the 3, they all feel cheaper and are in the shop. Same for a five year old BMW (and I love some Beemers). "
"One reason might be because by the time you are even able to get your model 3 (configure it, pay for it, have it delivered) the misalignment issues will have been fixed, as they‚Äôre mainly due to the fact that they‚Äôre shelling them out as quickly as possible right now. Keep in mind even if you decided you want the 3 over an S class, there‚Äôs over 400k people you have to wait behind."
"I own a model X, I‚Äôm definitely drinking it."
Market share is how much of the market a product represents. Android is a massive percentage of market share meaning a majority of cellphones run on Android. Profit share is basically money to be made in that market. Basically while Apple is a very small percentage of total cellphones they are a huge part of total profit. Why is this bad? Well I'll gloss over a lot of reasons and start with the simple stuff. Profit is what you can convince your customers to pay over cost. If Apple has a very low market share but a high profit share what does that say about the price vs cost of their product? Apple's business model has always been getting people to spend $600 on a $200 phone.
No. I was talking about the analogy.
"Jobs came back and saved the day.

Apple are the best marketing company in the world. They don't have the best products in the world, but the ""less informed"" believe they do. I wish Tesla were more focused on quality than marketing, but I get it. Hype counts as sales are crucial. But they need to think longer-term."
"Hmmmm...I think I've heard of him, LOL!"
"So, the analogy is just that people are queuing, waiting? So it's not really an analogy. Just a simple comment with no real meaning? If so, got it."
"Yo, what the fuck man. "
That‚Äôs entirely true. I think we‚Äôre making the same point. Amazon has scale already. Tesla doesn‚Äôt. 
That and patents mean cock all especially when the chinese knock out a shit tonne of knock offs without amy legal issues. 
"Actually the battery replacement itself is relatively quick, it was even originally designed for rapid battery swap as an alternative to charging. The high cost is the battery itself. But by the time a battery needs to be swapped and is simultaneously out of warranty, further cost reduction from manufacturing scaling will likely reduce the impact significantly.  Even now, salvaged packs from accidents are pretty affordable on eBay etc and the demand is apparently lower than the supply."
"No, their opex includes significant costs associated with expansion. It isn't just capex. Furthermore, their opex reflects a scale up including the Model 3 program. So once Model 3 initial production has reached its sweet spot, then we can talk about operational profits. Profitability is the last thing Tesla needs right now. And investors understand this. Their opportunity lies in continuing to seize first mover advantage.

Solarcity is not terrible financial decision making... there were fixes to be made, and Tesla has been making them. Ramping down residential PPAs but increasing utility scale, commercial, and outright purchased systems. Solarcity is gross margin profitable and provides a base for the ongoing mission. Figures you can't see that yet.
"
"> No they would not be profitable if they stopped expansion. 

Source please"
"Not disagreeing. Buying a new vehicle tends to be financially impractical.

The plant tat Panasonic and Tesla have in Nevada is not the worldwide largest...it might be someday, but it is far from operating anywhere near planned capacity (musk is also very successful at planning to do something, achieving an initial stage, and convincing everyone he has actually achieved the end goal. Full self driving is another example).

Apple invented the smartphone. No such thing existed before. The first one was a true design milestone. Changed what we think about as a phone and how we interact with computers and networks. Tesla didn‚Äôt invent solar panels, home battery storage, roof tiles, the EV or self driving AI. Musk isn‚Äôt changing the world, he just knew that he could pocket billions of dollars for doing it even if his company never makes a profit and his investors lose everything. He has brass balls and doesn‚Äôt care- I admire him for that if nothing else.

"They are, though.

When executives talk about putting in 100 hour weeks, they aren't talking about a coder or developer working crunch, eating a cold cut at their desk while they type with their other hand, they're talking about three hour dinners with supplier reps that feature about ten minutes of anything that could charitably be called work-related conversation. 

I've worked for people like musk before, plenty of them. They're all like that. Time spent asleep on a plane is work for them, time spent driving to work is work for them. Executives qualify everything as work because a) no one's actually keeping track of their hours, so they don't actually have to hold themselves to any standard and b) it's a dick measuring contest to see who can be the most workaholic among the country club set.

Probably because Tesla lives on the hype. Having people who are willing to wait in line to test drive for two minutes keeps their business afloat. If there isn't enough these people Tesla would have some major problems.

A touchscreen is flat and not tactile, you absolutely have to use it while looking at it, especially when driving the moving vehicle. You can see the people doing the work talking toWest Coast shops with how much slight front end damage there are to these cars because the screen is so distracting. 

Another thing, is that when someone is moving from a 10-year-old Toyota Avalon to a brand new car it's going to feel like the future. Most of the people super into the teslas very clearly do not know what they're talking about. Their frame of references are completely off. "

You mean it has directly accessbile buttons and doesn't force you to navigate through 7 menus and sub-menus to change the seat settings.

It's not an ""old man clock"" - It's an analogue clock an they look fance. But calling it ""old man clock"" shows that you can't be very intelligent if you try to devalue a car because it has a nice clock..

Well the 3 is like 40 cm smaller and much lighter. Maybe you should compare it to an Audi A4, Mercedes C-Class or a BMW 3. But you can also drive to the theatre or to the school with an S-Class.

You mean buttons which you can actually use blindy without getting massivly distracted? Multiple studies have shown that using touchscreens in cars is a distracting as texting while driving.

"> After battery prices have significantly come down.....

So you then agree that they weren't able to due to the prohibitive cost of batteries. 

Then comes along Tesla to the same exact battery price market and says hey, let's not buy them, let's make them and a broke car startup manages to bring electrics to the mainstream for probably less money than GM spent making next year's Tahoe 2 inches longer... but sure, battery prices were the reason.

I don't actually care about Teslas as cars as I would never buy one because I dont value cars enough to spend that much money.

However, I dislike when Steve Jobs is heralded as the greatest innovator ever.  He was a salesman who knew what needed to be done to sell more gadgets to people. The computer revolution would have happened without him just like the EV revolution would have happened eventually without Elon Musk. 

Also agree that Elon Musk promises a lot more than he delivers.  But i think you're being a little cynical that the battery factory wont ever reach full production. Elon musk is 15 years into it. That is the equivalent of what apple was up to in 1991. So maybe give him a chance?

Well now there is no guessing as every port does everything. I believe you can charge the device from any port too.

The AMG and sport packages cannot move the center of mass or introduce electric motors. And thus the handling is very different. The 3 handles better than the S/X or MB S.

Not sure where all these problem Teslas are. When you survey owners they rate it as a buy again. But my point was the scheduled maintenance, not warranty repair.

I‚Äôm not trying to devalue anything, nor am I unintelligent. The MBS is a nice car. But to let blind passion try to dump all over the Tesla product; that should indicate bias. If that‚Äôs the best argument one can make out your fingers back to the keys.

My SL55 is approaching its ninth birthday, going well but age is catching up with it. Let me say first of all that I maintain the car according to Mercedes' schedules but as an engineer, I make sure the work really does need to be done and I drive the dealer down on price. Some of the items are needed because of passage of time. This is the work I've agreed to for the latest service:

- Service B
- New Supercharger Drive Belt
- New Spark Plugs
- Replace Brake Fluid
- New Wiper Blades
- New Front Brake Discs and Pads
- New Air Cleaner
- New Fuel Filter
- Replace Damaged Front Undertray - I drove over a dead badger
- Fix Gearbox Oil Leak
- Fix Driver's Leaking Massaging Seat Back Rest - sounds like a whoopy cushion when I lean back
- Refurbish 2 Front Wheels - 1 minor scuff, both have lacquer lifting.

That's it. About ¬£3000, $4800. The message is clear. This is an expensive car to maintain if you are to keep it in top condition. Of course, some jobs could be done outside the M-B dealership, but even so"
">Apple does have some of the best technology and best products in the world.

Tesla also has residential and municipal batteries and solar panels.
"No, that‚Äôs not the case at all. Saying that Amazon is diversified because they sell books AND furniture is like saying Tesla is diversified because they sell a car AND an SUV.

Now, if you want to talk about where all the profit comes from, and discuss AWS, I‚Äôll give you a diversity argument. But that wasn‚Äôt the original point. "
">He's saying Amazon is diversified while Tesla literally only has cars

Tesla is far from just cars. Tesla is more generally an energy company. They are the largest seller of solar panels in the US and also sell battery systems to support those panels.

>and they can't even seem to get that right.

Tesla customer satisfaction is quite high, you'll have to clarify."
Is X factor is this insane following and trendiness that has latched on and pushed them. People buying their products are buying shares aggressively also.

To be fair, a survey conducted by a marketinf firm with only ~300 participants is not a very good source. But if you look at the avg. income of tesla owners, you can guess that the normal Tesla owner has multiple cars. If his Tesla breaks, he can simply drive another car, so he is not as affected by it as someone who has only one car. "
"Apple has an ARM architectural license and designed their own mobile cores. Their own design has the highest performance per watt and highest single core performance for ARM64 implementations. And not only did they develop their own high performance hardware, they also own the entire software stack on top, including being the first to convert their entire development toolchain to AArch64 and then leverage things like tagged pointers. This isn't the place to get into it wrt Apple, but Tesla is in very much the same kind of way in terms of looking to achieve technology and scale advantages ahead of others. For example, the situation with battery cell production reminds me of what Apple did with NAND flash in the iPod days. Also, Tesla's ""job"" is much, much tougher than Apple's ever was and the market opportunity is far higher. "

"Lmao. If you think you're remotely correctly, you should really get your head out of Teslas ass. 

First of all...Amazon has holdings and subsidiaries in every level and component of retail. Shipping, courier services, e-commerce platform, retailer, whole foods market, and manufacturer. Not only that they have Audible, Twitch, Amazon books,  Amazon studios, goodreads, graphiq, and AWS. This isn't even all of the different subsidiaries they have in different industries and segments.  

Meanwhile Tesla is an automaker, energy storage, and solar panel manufacturer. 

Amazon has managed to infiltrate and take over not just retail and commerce, BUT managed to create a whole ecosystem around it. Tesla is FAR less diversified. Yes they have come a long way in battery technology, but IIRC they still are piggy backing off of Panasonic batteries and technology. Even so, in the public's eyes Amazon is a retail company and a damn successful one that revolutionized ecommerce and lives up to the expectations.  Tesla is still largely a car manufacturer (to the pubic)  that has continuously failed to meet targets and expectations quarter after quarter. Is Tesla absolutely crushing every other competitor as well?  No far from it.  Yes they may have pushed the industry to move to electronic cars faster,  but in the bigger picture they have made a dent in the industry.  Just because they're much more marketing heavy than are other auto manufacturers doesn't mean they are nearly as impressive as you think they are.  

And being diversified doesn't mean they have more segments that are profitable.  "

Oh Apple... do they ever know how much we all like hoarding loads of pointless items. The more items I need for any one thing in my life... the less I have to think about gifts for people. 
So another thing you have to buy? Also can you connect lightning headphones? 
The point is that neither come with that cable so you will have to buy it separately. Of course with airdrop and iTunes syncing over wifi there isn't really any need to connect the two unless you want to charge the phone off the laptop.

No I mean you can do both at the same time with a single cable. One cable from your 5K monitor into your USB C port will both receive video output and charge your MacBook. No dongle required.

"Your analogy is okay. But remember, iOS can't even handle notifications in a nice way yet, nor has iOS been tuned to be more organic and user-friendly, such as having settings *within* the app, rather than having to leave an app to enter Settings, to make changes, then leave Settings and reopen the App, etc. it's laggy way behind, and has done since the iPhone 4, or maybe 5.

As for ARM, you're trying to compare Apples and Oranges. It's like sticking a truck engine in a car, or vice-versa. What's most important to focus on, the engine, or the vehicle, because Apple has the engine, but the vehicle is out-of-date.

I love what Tesla is trying to do, but I do feel let down by Elon Musk's overhyped and false promises, particularly when I see other car companies have pulled ahead of Tesla. Saying that they have everything in place to take the lead in the future isn't good enough, and I'll see it when I believe it. What Tesla owners want is for the promises which he gave, and are now nearly a year late (AP2) to be delivered now.

When you see cars like this being tested on the road, you wonder why our ""beta"" Teslas don't offer anything similar? See here: https://youtu.be/l3ELVACR2VY And that's Renault.

I do understand Tesla is currently gathering high-density maps to ""fudge"" and program their promised drive from LA to NY in Feb/March, but that's not something Tesla drivers can use today, or this year, and we were promised it last year. At least Apple does not make false promises. They just sell the dream, not the product."

"> So it's not really ""let's just make them"", it involves a battery partner that supplies a significant amount of the pack.

That's not what it's about, it's about finding a solution to the problem of expensive batteries, vs just saying, well batteries are expensive and therefore EVs are not viable so we won't do them.

> I'd love to see this evidence that demand for EVs is currently more than that.

As I have pointed out in the answer to the next set of questions, yes, when literally every manufacturer is introducing BEVs with some even claiming to go half or full EV fleet by 2025... that's going mainstream. Unless you think all the other manufacturers are just lying. There is also the 500k pre-orders for the 3 and the S/X being highly competitive in their price range, much more than 1%.

> First to what? They didn't build the first EV. They weren't the first to sell 100k EVs. They weren't the first to bring out a sub-$40k EV, or even a sub-$40k EV with 200+ miles of range. What exactly are they first at?

Some of these claims are just factually incorrect and further even the ones that are technically accurate are naive. It's not about the date someone released an X mile car at Y cost, it's about demonstrating the viability of producing BEVs.

Here are some quotes from Wikipedia on the history of electric automobiles, straight from the horse's mouth:

> The Roadster was the first highway legal serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells, and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 200 miles (320 km) per charge.

> Senior leaders at several large automakers, including Nissan and General Motors, have stated that the Roadster was a catalyst which demonstrated that there is pent-up consumer demand for more efficient vehicles. GM vice-chairman Bob Lutz said in 2007 that the Tesla Roadster inspired him to push GM to develop the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in hybrid sedan prototype that aims to reverse years of dwindling market share and massive financial losses for America's largest automaker.[86] In an August 2009 edition of The New Yorker, Lutz was quoted as saying, ""All the geniuses here at General Motors kept saying lithium-ion technology is 10 years away, and Toyota agreed with us ‚Äì and boom, along comes Tesla. So I said, 'How come some tiny little California startup, run by guys who know nothing about the car business, can do this, and we can't?' That was the crowbar that helped break up the log jam.

End quotes.

> Scrambling? Come on. Who's scrambling? And you still didn't address the question of how a company that's (still) unprofitable on an operating basis and is aiming to get a single digit percent of car sales over the next 5 years is a threat to the very existence of other automakers.

Everyone. I did exactly that, I asked you to explain why all of a sudden everyone is planing to add BEVs to their fleet but 5 years ago they were all claiming it's not viable and laughing at Tesla.

>As I have pointed out in the answer to the next set of questions, yes, when literally every manufacturer is introducing BEVs with some even claiming to go half or full EV fleet by 2025... that's going mainstream.

Because ""not currently viable"" doesn't mean ""never ever viable""?  And why wouldn't they laugh at Tesla?  They talk huge, deliver late (if at all), continually miss on promises, and are still running an operating loss.  Hell, they can't even hit deadlines they set for themselves six months ago.  Laughing at what a shitshow Tesla is doesn't mean they don't think BEVs will be viable for certain markets in the next 5-10 years."

"> Are they wrong? Tesla is still running a hefty operating loss. That's not a viable business model.

Of course they are wrong. Batteries are still expensive yet we have the Bolt and many plans for more, even Lutz himself admitted that they were wrong. Batteries don't just become cheaper magically, it takes investment. Surely, big auto can be much more efficient and needs waaaay less capital to get into BEVs then Tesla who started with literally nothing, on the other side of the country no less. And, i know you will deny this, but the product itself is profitable and surely GM or Ford can run their ops much more efficiently and source parts much cheaper than Tesla can due to volume, so even if Tesla isn't showing profit this quarter doesn't mean GM can't make a profit.

> Yes, going mainstream, in the next 5+ years. By definition, not currently mainstream.

Inevitable.

Sure, now continue reading the rest of that sentence.

Deflecting from the argument and just because I quote Lutz doesn't mean he isn't an idiot.

They talk huge, deliver giant, and yes, sometimes world changing innovation is late, like a self-fucking-driving car lol. Elon's Tweets are not *deadlines* his job is to keep up interest, you think Elon is stupid enough to not have realized, hey I say shit that is late all the time, why don't I just shut up. He does that on purpose because it sells reservations and commits people to an idea, and then they invest waiting time and think, hey I waited 2 years, what's a month? It's a strategy.

Those that are just laughing will keep laughing straight to the bankruptcy proceeding in 5 to 10, but you don't see anyone laughing now do you? No, they are figuring out how to build BEVs."
"> Of course they are wrong. Batteries are still expensive yet we have the Bolt and many plans for more

Again, ""not currently viable"" doesn't mean ""never will be viable"".  You seem to be confusing the two.

>And, i know you will deny this, but the product itself is profitable

Based on....?  You keep repeating this and still haven't offered actual evidence to back it up.  First it was the Model S that was going to be profitable and make Tesla profitable, then the Model X, now the Model 3, and I'm sure once Model 3 production flattens out you'll claim all those products are profitable and it's the semi or Model Y that will make Tesla profitable.  It's always the same story, point to positive gross margins and pretend the rest of the costs are just ""growth"".

>100k and 200 miles.

And where did I claim they weren't the first to do that?

>Deflecting from the argument and just because I quote Lutz doesn't mean he isn't an idiot.

Of course, he's only an idiot when he says things you don't agree with.

>They talk huge, deliver giant

We'll have to agree to completely disagree on that.

>Elon's Tweets are not deadlines

How about his statements in earnings calls?  Or Tesla's quarterly shareholder letters?  This isn't just about him tweeting things that don't happen.  That's a much longer list.

>Those that are just laughing will keep laughing straight to the bankruptcy proceeding in 5 to 10

I'll bet you any amount of gold that Tesla goes bankrupt before any major automaker.  "
"> Again, ""not currently viable"" doesn't mean ""never will be viable"". You seem to be confusing the two.

Ok sure, so then why not wait until it's viable, why get in now when it's still not viable but somehow different, what is that difference hmmm, maybe Tesla?

> Based on....? 

There are like 50 pages of argument of this topic between you and I, we can just go back and read that.

> And where did I claim they weren't the first to do that?

Up above, but that's besides the point.

> Of course, he's only an idiot when he says things you don't agree with.

Honestly whether I think he is an idiot or not is my opinion, but what he said and acted on is a fact that stands independent of me thinking anything about him. You mistake me quoting Lutz with me agreeing or thinking he isn't an idiot for saying this particular thing, which isn't the case. I am only telling you that GM revived the EV program because of Tesla, and that's not my opinion that's a statement from Lutz.

> We'll have to agree to completely disagree on that.

I don't understand how, I mean they promised a sport EV and built it, then they promised a high-end EV in higher volumes, delivered it, and then promised an SUV, delivered it, then a mass market EV, delivered it, Semi... delivered it. AP is running late, in the grand scheme of things a couple years up and down don't really matter, and if you are discussing Alcantara headliners and windshield wipers and other trivial minutia which are irrelevant in a conversation about the mainstreaming of a new transportation economy, well then I guess we can agree to disagree about the importance of such irrelevancies.

> How about his statements in earnings calls? Or Tesla's quarterly shareholder letters? This isn't just about him tweeting things that don't happen. That's a much longer list.

Yes he makes forward looking statements and has an optimistic outlook, again for the audience of investors, and for the same reason as tweets, he knows what he needs to do to drum up investment. Again, the man lands rockets backwards and is changing the world of transportation, you think it's passed by him somehow that he hasn't met timelines, lol?

> I'll bet you any amount of gold that Tesla goes bankrupt before any major automaker.

Or you could provide actual evidence this time instead of ""Tesla says so"" and ""25% gross margins"".

No, I want a specific quote of where I said that.  Because I didn't.

>I don't understand how, I mean they promised a sport EV and built it, then they promised a high-end EV in higher volumes, delivered it, and then promised an SUV, delivered it, 

Holy shit, they promised they were going to make a vehicle of some sort and then made a vehicle of some sort?  Come on.  That's the lowest of bars you could set.  Literally all that says is it's not *all* vaporware.

>then a mass market EV, delivered it, Semi... delivered it.

Yet to be seen on both.

>AP is running late, in the grand scheme of things a couple years up and down don't really matter, 

Sure, aside from decreasing confidence in the brand and calling into question all timelines and promises they set.

>and if you are discussing Alcantara headliners and windshield wipers and other trivial minutia which are irrelevant in a conversation about the mainstreaming of a new transportation economy

Throwing out buzzwords isn't going to help you here.  Discussing a bait and switch on interior materials and advertising a nonexistent feature for many months is ridiculous.  Can you imagine if an automaker that actually produces notable quantities of cars pulled these stunts?  Tesla gets a pass right now because they're a niche brand with some good marketing and rich fans.  That's not sustainable.

>Again, the man lands rockets backwards and is changing the world of transportation, you think it's passed by him somehow that he hasn't met timelines, lol?

Sure, except it's an EV with 200+ miles of range and they did it 4 times so far, but ok yea it's all vaporware and somehow there are 200k owners of cars that don't exist, it's like the biggest conspiracy since the moon landing.

> Yet to be seen on both.

Right agin, the Model 3 isn't real, just vaporware, and that Semi was a magic trick. Tesla is just a front for stealing money from the gub'mint and a Ponzi scheme, fuck Tesla.

> Did you miss the part where Tesla was literally days away from bankruptcy and those loans along with major investments from other automakers saved Tesla from going under?

Nope, just that those are loan programs for a different purpose and not bailouts, GM also got those but on top of that got a bailout as well.

"""i have the dream to walk one day on the mars... oh and having an own rock restaurant. i have two dreams. walking on mars and a restaurant"""
Why so many morons in comments behave like they cannot work on two (or more) things at once?
"This is a great idea, but I don't want to get fat owning a Tesla.  Would love to see some healthy restaurants.  Would also help to ensure svelt and attractive consumers."
"Why don't you first put your mind to important things, you know, like actually running the company where everything is behind schedule."
What a wild idea. Here's another wild idea: get your shit together on model 3 production. 
"Fuck that, I want a Tesla (and SpaceX) themed amusement park."
something exciting is always happening with this guy. love it.
"neat...now how about spreading to the rest of the US to make owning and maintaining one of your vehicles easier instead of this markety BS. 

I shouldn't have to drive 600 miles to get to a service station and 50 miles to get to a Tesla charging station."
"Now I want a ""Street Rod"" remake for the modern era..."
"In 7th grade my Tech Ed teacher made us design a electric power station that would see customers at the location for at least 45 minutes to charge. An old school diner with a trucker station mixed in was what I came up with. 

Now Musk is taking my idea and running with it... damn. "
"Sounds cool, but how about meeting your production deadlines first for once? "
People here are freaking out like *‚Äùholy fuck what a genius move! People love rock‚Äù* when the reality is that he was probably drunk or high when he made this tweet.
This screams Fallout.
Alright. You‚Äôre convincing me to join the herd. 
"If he could offer robotic Max Headroom-style servers with 80's pop star and politician personalities, I'm in.

"Shareholders were wondering what Musk would do to show he's going to start off 2018 by focusing on the mismanagement and scattered leadership that have caused him to miss every deadline and projection.  Sounds like the fix is for him to be daydreaming about random theme restaurant add-ons.  Buy buy buy!

MY DOOD! You know I love to roll bounce. 
"~~one~~ all. You meant all, Elon."
With cars for booths?
actually awesome
"Sounds very Black Mirror.,."
"Drive in RESTAURANT , NOT CINEMA"
"Should have bluetooth audio connection into cars at each stall. Auto connects when in range, with the outside projected video delayed just enough to sync with bluetooth audio.

Any audio playing outside the cars should be delayed as well, to sync with projected video."
"They should really (and of course make sure it doesn't deploy by accident for obvious reasons) make it so the screen/windows can turn opaque and display video apps/movies/etc on the windshield. If they could partner with an established franchise instead of building their own (hint: sonic) they'd have a fucking no brainer reason to go to a charging station, you'd get to eat food too and watch the news or a movie or something."
"If this pans out, other larger SC stations may attract different vendor investments.  As more EV on road and expending Tesla vehicles, large major Tesla SC will be attractive venue to attract food and drink vendors.  Tesla having more higher $ income customer base will help to. "
"Instead of Poppy Land we get Elon Land, is there going to be Elton John?"
But seriously does this mean Tesla can generate revenue from its superchargers? As a landlord?
Just tell us which one already!
That‚Äôs a dumb idea.
Glad the taxpayers are here to fund your whims. 
haha thats awesome!
"Does anyone actually believe what this guy says these days?

He‚Äôs said an awful lot, he‚Äôs not quite delivered. Not saying he‚Äôs a bad guy, but grain o‚Äô salt maybe. There‚Äôs a lot of stuff he said last week I‚Äôm still waiting on."
Drive in where the movie audio syncs in the car for full surround sound theater experience. Order straight from the dash. 
Thanks rocket jesus. I'm sure the people staffing it will be paid and treated well.
Just make sure you got a 5 dollar shake

Tesla drive in movie theatre. Would be awesome. With automated servers!
Embrace the charge! Having a great time while pumping electrons in your tesla. Musk 4 president!
Not surprising after learning that he is a huge fan of fallout
"I've also purchased a drive-in theater, and the entirety of Ed Wood's back catalog.  - Elon"
"i knew that tesla superchargers would become destinations in themselves.  I plan to bring my yoga matt (i have had back surgery so that why I picked it up), but I can imagine others playing sports, doing circut training, throwing the frisbee.  my guess is the day that supercharging take less than ten minutes, many of us will wish for the days when charging took a bit longer.  so healthy to get out and exercise when on a long road trip."
"so the drive in, instead of the poles with speakers separating the cars it'll be superchargers"

Elon musk for president of earth
Welcome to Johnny 'RocketX' ;)
Tesla Arcade seems perfect... 
All I want is old video games. 
This will probably be built before the model 3 orders are filled
sounds dank actually
Just put one in Long Beach. Any kind. 
"plugin to charge and hear the audio for the screen movie snacks near the chargers and screen with restaurant on the back of the snack bar

sounds great. id be tempted to drive there to experience it once
"
Would be cool if he added high speed wifi and allowed the car to play Netflix or amazon prime videos when plugged in or the car is in park.  Dinner and a movie in your tesla. 
They can also put an exercise area around the SC station where people can walk or stretch while their car is charging.
"You know, they tried to open an old fashioned drive in place around here, I tried it once, and I hated sitting in a parking lot full of cars idling and putting out exhaust.  

But hey, I guess that's not a problem with electric cars.  "
How about figuring out how to produce more Model 3s first then worry about adding on garbage to supercharger stations later.  
I guess they aren't shipping cars so they may as well make a few bucks with a restaurant.
"Elon needs to focus on his business, not flights of fancy."
"Something like this?

Right better to focus on this than get the Model 3 production going
"Dude! He listened! When he said he was looking into convenience stores at charge stations I tweeted at him that he should do a full service drive in diner! I swear, that guy listens better than any other CEO and that's why he has so much success

"Hey while you're at it Elon - I'd like to suggest that you install an 80's / 90's roller skating rink with a nice arcade.

Just make sure they don't over-do the chicken dance in one night.  Thank you very much kind sir!  You are a true heRo."
Another terrible idea.  I guess he didn't see that Ray Kroc documentary
How about putting some old-school electricity back in Puerto Rico? Did you forget you said you would?
This reminds me of Pimp My Ride and it's not gonna end well.
Sounds more like an elaborate safety test to see if Tesla's can stop before hitting fast moving humans by forcing a car and skater cohabitation under their watchful eyes.

I wonder how they're going to cook the rocks for this restaurant?
"He's playing with other-people's-money, so he doesn't care if he wastes another million with this ""idea"". Tesla burns a million every two hours, so it's not like this is the wasteful project that will break the bank. But he'll care eventually, when OPM money runs."
"don't do it elon, it's a trap. i can hear the sex harassment lawsuits already."
"because he's a millionare fuck who can't be bothered with you know real problems facing america so why not put in a nostalgic restaurant. Building moon bases where he can jack off his seed into orbit, ponder about ubi which would only further excommunicate the working class from societal gains. Seriously fuck this guy and all his bourgie friends, developing their moon bases to leave us all fucked when the climate finally collapses and feel great about it because ""i made million dollar electric cars that drove themselves sometimes"". This is what Mao warned about when academics would only use their knowledge for personal gain. Fuck. This. Guy."
"The LA chargers are moving to Mars, to retain surname LA.  SpaceX expected to prepare payload of toddlers to begin training on  Mars in preparation for season 2035."
Now this is the plan: Get your ass to Mars. 
nah fuck that we totally need new roller skate and rock restaurants on earth

Drive-in movie theater. 
"Now when one of the employees on roller skates comes out to bring your ocean water, they‚Äôll trip and dent your Tesla‚Äôs hood instead! Neat!!"
A Supersonic if you will.
"I took my mom to a sonic when out christmas shopping, she loved it. She thought these places were long since gone and was super excited to see a drive-in like she remembered from her childhood.

I'm down for more sonics and places like them. I'm not a huge fan of tesla but this seems like a great idea."
A super-sonic? Supersonics? SEATTLE CONFIRMED NEXT LOCATION.
"Lake Charles, LA Supercharger is literally at a Sonic. 

...And it‚Äôs in ‚ÄúLA‚Äù"
& knuckles
"Char GINGAS usual, I see!"
How long does it take to charge a Tesla?
"Exactly. People are acting like it's just a silly flight of fancy, but it's actually quite important to start creating this kind of thing to show it works.

Right now the majority of people with a Tesla are at least somewhat interested in EV's, whether for environmental reasons or because they prefer the drive. They're willing to put up with certain inconviences (like sitting in their car at a Supercharger for 40 minutes with only their phone to keep them entertained) because they prefer EV's over ICE's. For EV's to really skyrocket in popularity they need to appeal to all the people who don't care about them, as well as people who don't really care about cars in general. One of the major things that puts those people off EV's is the charging wait times. 

They can work on speeding it up, but for the foreseeable future it's still going to be far slower than filling up with fuel. So when EV's start to take over, there is going to have to be a shift in how 'refuelling' is handled. There'll be a new market for all sorts of things like this. Restaurants, drive-ins, stores, arcades, activity centres...it has the potential to be quite exciting actually, and that's how Tesla needs to begin framing it. 'Look at all the fun places we can stop on our road trip' vs. 'Look at all the time we have to spend charging'."
Maybe it's after the review of the model 3 that just came out that said charging alone in a parking lots sucks. And added a restaurant or entertainment would be nice.
"I feel like all these tidbits Elon is tweeting about should be held until he has better news about other more major things that people are worrying about. Then it makes more sense to talk about how electric cars are going to be great and that you can charge your car while shopping and the car will never be low battery anywhere because critical mass and demand makes these things a no-brainer.

Like this shit definitely isn't something he needs to talk about and worse, nobody is going to care about this in 24 hours. So what's the point right other than to tweet it? Feels like hes embracing tweeting way harder than before for no practical reason. "
"If by business model you mean marketing tactics sure, because the man's business models are garbage without the marketing behind it all, the same marketing that convinces people to buy a badly manufactured car with a reputation for failing basic quality standards or go ape shit over work environments with crazy high turn over because the dude is a prick."
"He means a drive-in restaurant [like this](http://frostop.com/images/post/720201675616PM_blog-drive-in.jpg), right? Not a drive-in movie theater?"
"Even if this isn't a drive in theater, there are still operating drive in theaters in Southern California for you to stop at.  "
"There's a drive in theater in Newberg, OR of you want something a little closer!"
"I'm sure it's the restaurant version of ""drive-in."" "
The the latter makes more sense with the roller skates and restaurant parts of the comment. Theatre would be impractical. Who wants to watch just part of a movie? 
"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/949846430750920704

>	And an outdoor screen that plays a highlight reel of the best scenes in movie history."
They could show 30-45min short movies that would be perfect for getting a milkshake and charging.
"Woah, Nicole Wegman makes Wesley's skating look like horse shit. But a little research shows neither of them won:

Holy shit there's a Sonic with a parking lot that's smooth enough for roller skating? Every Sonic I've seen in Texas looks likes a battlefield.

So they switch. Now people criticize them for the son riding while the father walks. So they both get on the donkey and people begin to criticize for such a crazy idea. So both of them get off the donkey and walk. When they do, they are criticized. So they finally do the thing that makes the most sense; they throw the donkey off a cliff. And they are criticized."

Shouldn't your Tesla charging station be measured in feet or inches from your house and not miles?
"I think production issues are out of Elon's hands for the most part. He can give pep talks, but for the most part he is just an observer.

I've seen it personally where some executive tries to get involved with technical issues. We all agree with him, and when he leaves, we do what makes most sense, rather than act on his whim."
Is construction in LA going to slow down his manufacturing in Nevada somehow?
"True, but he was also probably on a red wine and Ambien cocktail when he first tweeted about the Boring Company.

"I don‚Äôt own a Tesla, but it‚Äôs been explained to me that the first 60% charged fast, in around 20 mins. The next 20% is another 10 mins and then the last 20% takes 30 mins.

If you could log in to Netflix or Hulu on your own personal screen it would be pretty cool. Watch an episode then get back on the road.
"But if he had to specify ""*and* and outdoor screen..."" it sounds like it is more of a drive in restaurant that will have a big tv that people can also look at. But the focus is the restaurant not the screen, since he is even saying it is just going to be showing movie clips."

You goofs are acting like a tiny pet project like this can possibly take away anything from any of his serious ventures. I hope you're not that stupid.
Right. A restaurant with a screen showing movie clips. Not a movie theater.
How does throwing the donkey off a cliff make sense?
"So they had a plan that attracted a lot of criticism, and they couldn't win and ultimatey lost control of their assets?

hmm."
There's actually one launching this evening. The big one is for the end of the month. 
"Unrealistic expectations set by Tesla, you mean?"
"Tesla projected to be building thousands of Model 3's a week by now, isntead they're building dozens a week. You can try to waver that away but it's bad.."
"they dont service this area so unless you are talking about an extension cord...no, not for me"
"Yea idk, I just wish there was a stronger production of the cars. I love them and a lot of people do, they are super popular, but when you have to pre-order the chance to pre order at an unknown date just to have your car delayed, something is wrong. They could make so much more money if they met demand better, hopefully they will focus on it soon"
"No, but there should be more investment into production when the demand is so high"
"It really shouldn't take up more than a few hours of his time from start to finish. He won't be the one getting permits, designing it, building it, running it. He just has to tell people to start working on it, and then every so often spend a few minutes approving a location, a design etc. 

As far as the money, it's a drop in the ocean for Tesla, and the press it would get when it opens would make it cheap advertising."
"Nope. Tesla is a failing, unprofitable company propped up by billions in taxpayer subsidies.

Trolls gonna troll. Probably an oil shill. 
"This guy is a salesman. He's selling us a 250 mph sports car, a self driving bigrig, a trip to Mars, yet he can't deliver on the existing orders on cars his customers have already paid for.

"the women skating around in short skirts, etc

"Yeah, that change is refreshing, among loons and trolls usually only trumpistas are strolling here."

"It will be a range of like 25 to 35; only men/women of impeccable physical and mental agility in all aspects will go on the first round; they have to survive not just the physical detriment of space travel but also the psychological mindfuck of leaving Earth behind, permanently, with the fastest help/supplies being sent with a 6-month transit. In addition to all this they must be supremely intelligent. It is believed that even the strongest mental faculties would suffer from insurmountable depression in these circumstances. So only the premium age range of humans would go on this voyage "
It takes less than a year to get there so I think qualifications are more important. 
"He's talked of people ""retiring"" on Mars to start a new life the way the US was settled, which covered pretty much the entire gamut of age ranges.

It‚Äôs definitely a drive-in movie theater.  Elon stated that it would show highlights of the best movie scenes in history. He also mentioned a restaurant but as a separate entity. 
And the roller skates
I am 100% sure you are wrong

It would be a good idea then to at least put a restaurant next door then
"I wouldn‚Äôt mind that. Every 3 hours break for an hour. I basically drive for 2-3 hours and break for 30 minutes anyways to hit the bathroom, check email, read a little bit of reddit, grab some new snacks and drinks and get going.  Plus it would break up the kids having the destination be the next skate break instead of the destination being an 8 hour drive. "
"My Samsung 18650's I use on my e-bike are the same way.

Well they take 5 hours~ish to fully charge my big pack, but the 60/20/20 breakdown is roughly the same ratios."
PayPal? The product of the company that merged with Elon's? The company that ousted him as ceo? Yeh PayPal existed before and after Elon stumbled into it. 
"A little, but only because people are blind to marketing whether it's by Elon or any other business (and you don't have to look far to see tesla and spaceX specifically target reddit). He's really not some hero of the planet, in fact, there's plenty out there that proves he is actually a bit of a prick. "
"You're right. I don't run a space program, I'll give him that. He owns SpaceX, a company known for very poor employee treatment. Overworking, sexual harassment, manipulative workplace etc. He treats the people that actually make that place what it is like shit. Reusable rockets were a thing before Elon and the only reason the company hasn't gone under is because NASA threw them a bone just as they were about to go under. 
Tesla is shit. Electric energy is good, but there's way more reliable electric vehicles out there. Elon misses every deadline and production number he announces, he tricks people into buying his cars with marketing bullshit like launching a car into space. People spend months waiting for their purchased car to arrive, it gets there and the door handles don't work, the body panels don't line up, there's rattles everywhere, scuffs and scratches on paint. They get sent back and wait another couple months and when they finally do get the car back there's still issues. People are getting ripped off. They're quick off the mark, but around a track theyre no better than some pretty average small sports cars worth a fraction of the price. Tesla suffers from the same working conditions as spaceX. Employees are treated like garbage by the same man who fired his long time nanny/house maid because she asked for a raise after years.

Hyperlink and any other public transport bullshit he half cooks up are a joke amongst city planners. His ideas straight up don't work a lot of the time because he really isn't as intelligent as people assume. And yes you'd be right, he is more intelligent than me that's for sure, but I don't blatantly lie to the public or people busting their arses to keep my shit alive. 

He does some good stuff, but let's not fall into the whole cult of personality thing and gobble up every morsel the man shits out. 

Big rant I know.

"There's an amazing drive-in movie theater about 10 minutes away from the Pittsburgh Airport and during the summer that place is absolutely PACKED. They're making very good business and there's no indication they'll be closing anytime soon.

Hello fellow Oregonian! There is still a drive-in along 99w I believe. 
"I'm not sure though, I think he could mean either one. Or both! A combination of the two would be awesome!"
There is a drive-in theater in San Luis Obispo. That is *slightly* closer to Oregon.
Then why the talk about popcorn in the comments?
"I'm seriously facepalming at these comments. ü§¶

A *movie theater* won't have an outdoor screen playing a highlight reel of the best scenes in movie history.

On the other hand, a supercharger location with a fast-casual outdoor *restaurant* (where people will want to spend far less time than the average movie length) could benefit from having an outdoor screen with a ""highlight reel of the best scenes in movie history"" for patrons to enjoy in the 30-60 minutes of time that they have to kill."
"You can eat inside if you want, but waiters will actually serve you in your car as well. And then you eat in your car in front of the restaurant. This sounds horrible for so many reasons, did people actually enjoy this?"
Yeah thats always been my experience as well. Locals really love that theater.
"If you are watching it on your own personal screen, isn't that just you using your own device and connecting to the wifi? and watching what you want as opposed to something sent and/or projected to a big screen."
"TV shows could work. They could stick with the 50's theme and show sitcoms like I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners etc. It's no big deal if you start or stop watching midway through shows like that.

The licensing/broadcast rights (or whatever applies) would probably be impossible to get or too expensive though."
"Emulating the ""Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater"" at Disney would work, just a collection of short trailers and things on loop : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VYNvIldNi0"
or just have on-demand content.  old plus new.
That would be awesome. I'm ashamed to admit it though.
"No, he doesn't. Drive in movies don't have car hops on roller skates. "
"Read it as:

Still sounds much more like a drive in restaurant that may just happens to have a screen outside.

So a drive in resteraunt that also has a screen for movie clips while you eat. 
"Yup, mansfield is the nice one."
bullshit. thats a stupid thing to say.
"To avoid the apparent source of the criticism. And obviously, it doesn‚Äôt."
"Yes. If you expect Elon Musk to fail at achieving his overall goals, you would be a fool. If you expect him to keep his own deadlines for doing so, you're a fool, too. That is part of his management style."
"Just to be clear, Tesla supercharger stations are not made for regular usage, they are intended for road trips. It is not like a gas station, you don't go to a supercharger to ""fill up""  you do that at home.

Since you live in a remote location, I assume that you have a house, what prevents you from charging when you get home from work and bam 100% next morning?"
You honestly think it's the car manufacturing plant automation engineers who will work on a drive-in *restaurant*? 
"GM despite a history of many more billions in subsidies, and opening plants outside the US to get cheaper labor, did go bust recently, and was taken over  and ""saved"" by the US govt in communistic fashion. Also Chrysler.

Ford didn't go bust recently, perhaps thanks to the many billions in subsidies they have received, and sending jobs overseas like GM et al.

Perhaps the most extreme ""subsidies"" any company has received for setting up a factory in a particular state was Boeing.

You used the words ""propped up"", but these are far more appropriate for what happened to GM and Chrysler, and various banks recently.

As for Tesla being ""unprofitable"", this company is still in it's start-up phase, where they are making costly efforts to expand. The sales of cars are profitable for them to the tune of... ~25%? This compares to GM's... ~11%? Large net profitability is expected with the ramp up of the T3, so by the end of the year hatter nutters like yourself will have to find something else stupid to whine about. 

Speaking of the future, the current administration is trying to organize an over $70 billion subsidy for coal (and oil?) to prop up  their unprofitability. Let's see how how much that outrages you."
Nope just an idiot. 
"I checked, he posts in TD. Kind of close, I guess ""Coal shill"" would be closer (not that that would be rational, but well... TD)."

"What movie theater shows movie *scenes* as opposed to actual *movies*? 

It's a restaurant with a screen to watch movie scenes while you eat and charge your car. Since it's only showing movie scenes, you won't have to miss half the movie when you're done eating and your car is charged."
"Right, but the original tweet said ""drive-in rock & rollerskates *restaurant*, there's no rock music, restaurant, or rollerskates at the drive in theater.. It wasnt until someone else mentioned popcorn that he turned it into a merged theater & restaurant..."
Is that like raw sewage?
"Yes, many movie theaters, grocery stores, and restaurants have charging, often free, and EV adoption will be much easier as more of said locations have charging, since you have to park and be there for 30+ minutes anyway."
"Pretty much every Supercharger location is chosen based on what's nearby.  Google maps has reviews of superchargers so people can tell others where to go and what to order, check it out if you're an owner-to-be and planning out road trips to a specific spot.  AbetterRoutePlanner lets you plan a route and will pick your stops, then you can google those superchargers to see what you can plan on eating.  "
Why would SpaceX need to market to Reddit? I don't think too many redditors are in the market for rockets.
"The context and the sentence (adjective - subject) structure indicates only restaurant.
"
"I think they meant a fixed screen at the drive in, but one per supercharger so you can watch different content to the people next to you. "
"> The licensing/broadcast rights (or whatever applies) would probably be impossible to get or too expensive though.

I think that only leaves one option. Tesla has to get into the TV show making business. "
"Uh, yes they do. Or yes they did back when they were a thing. Here's a probably staged photo of a carhop not on rollerkates bringing food to movie watchers in their cars.

Disney recreated the experience at their Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater Restaurant, though the cars weren't actually real:

> Established in May 1991, the restaurant is modeled after a 1950s drive-in theater. Walt Disney Imagineering designed the booths to resemble convertibles of the period, and some servers act as carhops while wearing roller skates. While eating, guests watch a large projection screen displaying film clips from such 1950s drive-in theater. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Fi_Dine-In_Theater_Restaurant"
No he confirmed on Twitter he meant movies. I was wrong... for the first and last time.
"> Drive in movies don't have car hops on roller skates.

???"
You‚Äôre wrong. 
"Swansea, Wales, or Chicago IL. Depends on the time of year and how close you are to making gulab jamun."
But no option (at least on the UK ones) to have pancake syrup on your breakfast wrap - only ketchup or brown sauce - so I still have to go to the human at the counter to order.
maybe musk will be fully machine operated with ai?
"japan I'm familiar, but these burgers are not being made by machines, I'm talking about completely machine made with little or no human interaction."
"Been probably 10 years since I've actually gone, I should check it out this year."
The man is a bullshitter who constantly promises things he can‚Äôt deliver. 
"This is a commonly held belief. The reason delays matters is that a business that consumes money without producing it creates a deficit which we call debt.

If delays were free, then whatever. But each quarter where they lose a few hundred millions bucks is a few hundred mill they need to pay back in future. 

Think of that debt as like a burden they have to carry. The higher it gets, the harder they have to work in future just to survive.

This is why people with an eye on the financials care about delays."
"Tell that to the teslavengelists in LA.

My cousin just got both of his model 3s, and he's been dropping by super chargers for regular use for years since they've been built with his model s.

(As if it's more convenient than going to a gas station...)"
"Because i don't want to live my life to just go to work and back.  If something breaks or I need to get the car serviced, it is a 600 mile drive to a tesla service station.  Imagine if the steering went out or something and the only way to get it to a place that can/will fix it is a days drive away because i have to take some wonky way out of the way route to make sure i can hit charging stations on my way there.  

I would love to own one of these cars but it is so impractical to do so in this area.   To make it clear, I have 2 cities with charging stations in a 60 mile radius from my home but between those 2 cities, only 1 charger is public use and it is not even built yet...  It is a tesla charger that was scheduled to be built like 3 or 4 years ago but never was.  

When i checked with Tesla about the home charging system at home, even though my state is listed in the ""selected areas"" they said they could not do it because I was outside the serviceable area. I even checked if they had the third party contractors to install it and still a solid ""nope"".  Because if there was a problem with the equipment they would not be able to send someone out to fix it.

With the average 10 miles per 8 hours of charging on 110v, my car would be dead in 2 weeks, 1 if I decide to go ANYWHERE other than work.


So every time I see this type of crap I get annoyed because it just feeds the fanboys and does nothing to solve some of the glaring problems and issues this company has when it comes to actually making and selling cars that people want to buy. "
Because he's a concern troll that doesn't actually own a Tesla.
"No, I just think Elon comes up with a lot of ideas, sometimes cool sometimes useless, and spending time and money on that instead of actually expanding Tesla so they can meet the demand and not break every deadline. This stuff it's just something small, but it ties into my general point"
"It does, in fact, enrage me. But, this post is about Tesla, not GM or Boeing. So, I did not think it relevant to mention them. The federal government should never apply taxpayers dollars to a private business. This is a long-held belief of mine and I criticize the government every time they do it. It is pretty apparent, though, that you are viewing this conversation through partisan-colored glasses and are clearly assuming I am a Republican by assuming I support federal assistance for businesses that Republicans often support. This is a something I experience often- from both sides of the aisle- and is a pretty clear indication of someone guided by a pre-selected narrative, unable to have any kind of organic conversation.

"One of the things my family did is go to drive in theaters. We sought them out all over the country when on vacation. Even today I love 20 minutes from one and we go 2 or 3 times a summer. 

While Disney may have used that as part of their attraction because car hops were a part of 1950s drive in nostalgia, I can assure you that most drive in theaters I have been to (maybe two dozen) did not. It would have been impossible because they were grass fields with gravel drives in almost all cases. "
"I think the Disney approach is a perfect fit because it handles people coming and going as they see fit, instead of showing actual movies they have a long loop of different old trailers and other short things. So you're never really ""late""."
He said there will be a screen outside the restaurant. That isn't a drive in theater. That is a drive in restaurant with a screen outside.

"I am not actually from the US. In my own country, I tend to vote for competent politicians which have been in different parties.

>The federal government should never apply taxpayers dollars to a private business.

So... you wished to complain about Fed govt subsidies in particular, but you didn't mention just what these subsidies are, and despite this being of little relevance to Tesla, you wanted to talk about it here?

This is a strange claim. When I suggested you meant the more relevant GM you said ""Nope"".

Still, I'll make a related comment or two.

For an even playing field, it is vital for externalities to be taken into account, such as by a carbon tax. Without this it is common  for govts to attempt to promote activities with less externality costs, such as the Bush ""$25 billion in low-interest loans to help General Motors Corp, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC produce more fuel-efficient cars and trucks."" of which Tesla was awarded... $452m (1.8%) and paid off quickly.

So, perhaps you time would be better spent attempting to promote such things as carbon taxes."

"We go to Disneyland way more than Disney world, but we went to world last August. Pandora was absolutely amazing, but we still prefer Land to World. Personal preference I guess.."
"And the addition of Ratatouille, Tron Lightcycle Run, Guardians Coaster (with an unfortunate location), the suspended Gondola system, the new ride in the Chinese Theater, and the rumored new pavillion for Epcot should bring WDW up to a bit higher quality than it has fallen to over the past decade or so.

"This is not true. Technically both parks were. Disneyland itself was designed and overseen by Walt. Walt also surveyed and planned Disney World up until his death.

I would argue that your car probably gets more than 10 hours every day, and since the battery is a fair bit larger than you need it to be, you could easily fill it up on the weekend and start with a little less battery each day.

"I mean did you ever go to ones that have an entry price twice what the average drive-in theatre charges, or would your parents have scoffed at that and never even considered paying? Extra entry ticket price could go to paying for sealing the entire theatre, making it suitable for premium services like carside food delivery during a movie."

"I work at an ethanol plant out in the middle of no where, we don't even have paved roads, much less any place to plug into.  It is about a 20 or so mile drive to work if I decide not to get something to eat in the morning.

  It is just really frustrating to see something like this being the priority instead of working on the infrastructure.  I was willing to do everything I could to make it possible to comfortably own one but they just would not take that step."
Possibly only looks at Tesla and all things Tesla and if not Tesla must not work with Tesla so doesn't know that one can use non Tesla electricity and non Tesla EVSE on a non Tesla NEMA plug. *shrug*
"Your point? I did say ""thousands"", not ""tens of thousands"".

Are you implying that the Model 3 has been a giant scam to raise... $500 million? By a company with a market cap of $52 billion? At the expense of designing an entire car, building an entire manufacturing line for it, and shipping several thousand cars? You expect that at some point they'll just say ""lol, we got your money, suckers"" and do an exit scam?

Turns out manufacturing high-tech cars quickly is difficult. Who knew?"
"He promised fuck all. It was a guidance, with the usual caveats that things change, and ramping up is hard. They have been very clear about that, hense ""production hell"". "
"Nope. Steve did not become Disney's largest shareholder (at around 7%) until after he sold Pixar to them, more than 20 years after EPCOT was built, and EPCOT had not been significantly modified since then (though they have just begun a $500MM renovation scheduled to be completed in time for Disney World's 50th anniversary in 2021)."
That's kind of what they already said 
I sadly have never been in my life.
Lol no. It would be two separate items due to the fact that there isn't an Oxford comma. The way it is written it old school drive in is one list item you then have the second list item which is roller skate and rock restaurant. This isn't that complicated and is like middle school level English.
"That is pop-up drive in with an inflatable screen. For all I know this venue/production is just conflating drive in theaters with cars and screens, and drive in restaurants with servers on skates.

Like how the 80s/50s bar in back to the future 2 got everything so weird and mixed up while trying to emulate those periods.

edit: To be clear. I believe there were car hoppers on skates at some drive in theaters over the decades, but so far have not seen any conclusive evidence they used to exist, and are not just being incorrectly emulated today.

edit2: that is also a stock photo, which are staged 99% of the time. There might not be actual skating car hoppers at that place.

"We went to whatever was on the way of our vacation. Price isn't a consideration when going to the movie and it isn't like there are enough around that there is a cheap one and an expensive one. There is only one, period. That is the one you go to. 

Show me one image that shows an actual 1950s drive in with a car hop on roller skates. "
"LOL. Yes, the restaurant will have an outdoor screen for people to view movie clips while they quickly eat, supercharge, then move on and make space for the next patron.

I *really* don't see how anyone interprets this as a full-on movie theater. It just doesn't make sense, when supercharger stalls need to be rotated every 30-60 mins. "
"Well if the utility company won't run you a 240V 2 phase power line to your house maybe in a few years solar and battery will make having such a plug feasible. 

I heard someone in my state a couple years had a cabin that needed $60k to run a power line or install something like 15kWh solar and 30kWh battery for $45k. With the rapid drop in prices for the things you need it might be 'reasonable' around 2021."

"The Oxford comma isn't as widely used as you think. In Denmark we don't use the Oxford comma, neither do they in any other part of Europe besides the UK. I am willing to bet it's the same in the rest of the world... "
Do you really think there wasn't a single drive-in theatre that served people in their cars on roller skates while they watch the movie? Like in all of the early 20th century America there wasn't a single one are you saying.
Maybe. Time will tell :) 
"Once again, nope:  the Wikipedia article about MagicBands credits the idea to Business Development VP John Padgett in 2013, 2 years after Steve Jobs died, and that Padgett got the kernel of the idea from an add in SkyMall while flying between FL and CA.

And MagicBands cover more than just EPCOT, they're an integral part of everything at Walt Disney World, from park entry to room keys to photos to shopping.

The closest thing you get to a direct connection between Steve Jobs and anything EPCOT is that in the modernization of Spaceship Earth (the ride inside the iconic geodesic sphere at the entryway), in the part about modern computers, they basically built something supposed to be Jobs' garage where Apple was founded, as the creation of the modern computer industry (i.e. personal computing), but that has nothing to do with MagicBands."
You are the one who's useless. I just tried to accentuate it. 
"Ya well let me be the first to tell you it's stupid to not use it, if you didn't realize already. If it were the standard across the board you wouldn't have ambiguous sentences like the one in the tweet. "
"I'm not saying that. I actually said the opposite. what I said was I have not been shown proof that they exist. re-read the comment you replied to maybe

> edit: **To be clear. I believe there were car hoppers on skates at some drive in theaters** over the decades, but so far have not seen any conclusive evidence they used to exist, and are not just being incorrectly emulated today.

And what I am saying is that drive in restaurants with roller skates were normal, but drive in theaters with roller skate people were not normal, which is why there is ***still*** no image provided to me of drive in theaters with roller skate people, but plenty of images of drive in restaurants with roller skate people, without even having to really search for those images.

edit: i believe they existed, I just want *at least some* evidence before I just agree that something is real. And so far I've seen no real evidence.

edit 2: still have been shown no evidence that they actually existed. I'm beginning to believe that **it was actually a creation of the 70s that thought that 50s drive ins had roller skate girls. And so those people in the 70s made movies/tv shows featuring that, even though it never actually existed in the first place.**

Like how no one in the 50s actually dressed like Travolta in Greese, but Greese made everyone in the 70s think people in the 50s dressed like that."
Probably not. They were grass fields with gravel drives mostly. I have been to a ton. 
It already has 
The bands themselves didn‚Äôt come until 2013 but the patents they used were filed by Apple in 2010
"I use it, I'm just telling you that not everyone uses it. And you're stretching it really thin trying to say Elon meant a drive-in theater from the beginning ""because he didn't use Oxford comma..."" The only reason you continue arguing this argument is because you're relying on the ambiguity...

Other question, who the fuck would want to sit and watch individual movie scenes while charging their car? I can understand eating a burger while waiting, but trying to drive your car into a drive in theater to charge your car, then leaving soon after is such a stupid concept."
"Sorry I didn't see your edit, I left this tab open for a while. I bet given enough time I could find a photo from before 1970 of a drive-in theatre that has servers wearing roller skates."
Some could have been concrete or bitumen. It's more expensive but it wouldn't have been the craziest thing they did back then.
"Citation? Nothing in anything I've come across says that MagicBands were anything but completely in-house by Disney, and I can't imagine them using someone else's patents *for technology which did not physically exist yet* if they didn't have to. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyMagic%2B

"
"I'm sure you can. But the fact that I have called it out so many times (and people have tried to prove me wrong by showing images that don't prove anything) and only images of drive in restaurants with roller skating waiters still show up shows how much more normal it is to have skating waitresses at a drive in restaurant compared to a drive in theater, which just has waiters on their feet (fucking plebs :)).

tl;dr skating waiters at drive in restaurants are ""normal"" but skating waiters at drive in movies are not. stop fighting this fact people. or at least show me one single image of a person on skates serving people at a drive in theater. still waiting. Pretty sure 50s skating server girls at drive ins are a creation of the 70s."
Yeah. You can't put gas in it.
How was it responding to outside temp? Any interesting stats?

I dig the license plate style
"Good job on not using any gas, how close were you to filling up your charging port with gasoline, was it tempting?"
"Is there any evidence that the increase use of fossil fuels to recharge these batteries is better than cars using fossil fuels? I'm not trying to start an argument, genuinely interested."
"Awesome picture!  Can't wait to see the car and meet you guys in Council Bluffs, IA!  Have a safe trip!"

What's up with the predated UK plate?
"Not a single drop of gas... Let's see.

According to Tesla's website, the best Model 3 range is 500 km with a 75 kWh battery : 70/500 = 0.14 kWh/km to keep it simple.

Your trip was 4 675 km long at least, so you consummed around 0.14*4675 = 654.5 kWh.

1% of the electricity in the US is produced directly from petroleum, so you have directly consumed 6.5 kWh of gas, which is 0,516 kg oil equivalent, which is 0.688 L or 0.18 gal (not accounting for the plant efficiency). That's 13 760 000 drops ;)

On a side note, if we consider the fact that 65% of the electricity produced in the US in 2016 comes from fossil energies (34% from natural gas, 30% from coal and 1% from petroleum), that's 0.65*654.5 =  425.4 kWh, so 36.5 kg oil equivalent or 48.6 L or 12.7 gal.

Which is still impressive, a classic car consumes around 5 times more.

My point is that even though we need to go full electric, we also need to improve the way we produce this electricity."
How many days did that take?
"How many stops (charging stations)were necessary for this trip?

Was there any surprises as far as getting farther distance on a charge than another?

How many days did this journey take?

Are you satisfied with your investment? 

With all this gas money being saved, was/is it worth the charge wait time? 

How long does it take to charge? Where do you charge? Do you just sit in the car while it charges?

Do some charges work better than others? So many more questions. I‚Äôm excited for you! I hope you can help me with some of these, or someone else who has the same thing. 

Congratulations!

Interesting. I would have been impressed if you used gas. 
I'd be more impressed had you used some gas.
Psh. I'd be impressed if you did that with a Tesla and _did_ use a bunch of gas!!
As opposed to the thousands who fill the tank of their Teslas with gas?
"Share the route you used... always wondered how this could be done, other than using Tesla's website to map each stop."
It‚Äôd be really weird if you did.

I don't think he knows what he's driving...
How much coal did you use?
I bet you haven't even tried to use some gas ... I wonder if you could have used some?
Plenty of coal though
We just used coal to make electricity instead. ..
It is a Tesla after all...
Why the fuck would you need gas in the first place it's electric
Why does the number plate and back bumper look like the paint has faded/worn away ?
Only to be bummed out because Guy;s place closed. Sorry kids. 
"'single drop' refers to a liquid. 'Gas' is well, a gas. You can't have a single drop of a gas.

You probably still contributed a load of co2 into the atmosphere though, you shouldn't make these journeys just for fun, people like you are just fucking the atmosphere up just for the hell of it lol"
Nevermind the fossil fuels at the power plant.
Cool story bro
Only had to stop at 16 Tesla stations! They were all out of the way!!
How much coal?
"I just ate every item off the menu at McDonald's, and didn't even eat a single piece of pizza"

So....what was the total carbon footprint of that journey? I'm talking from the mining of materials for the batteries to the final charge on the car.
Its cheaper to drive on oil still. 
"Well,i mean,its a Tesla....an electric car. Of course you didn't use gas. "

True. The impressive feat would be doing it whilst using a lot of gas.
"Buy a gallon of gas, put it in the passenger's footwell and claim you drove a Tesla Model 3 from New York City to San Francisco 'with' a gallon of gas."
Nice! Only burned a bunch of coal!
I didn't want to be the asshole. Haha
Buy a gas generator and recharge the Tesla with that. 
Big if true
Only used a bunch of clean coal ;)
I think it'd be impressive if you drove in a telsa with gas. Kinda hard to do. 
Other than the stuff in the cabin :p
Didn't mow a single lawn!
"Poorly in cold temperatures (in NYC right now at -13C). However, that's not to say that an ICE would perform any better."
"We measure in Wh/km only, and have not been measuring changes in consumption by speed, only by temperature so far (will release that data soon). Haven't really had many situations that called for driving at 65 mph."

Yeah but hopefully none of it was liquid.
Can confirm. Recently took a road trip and all those gas station burritos had to go somewhere.
Advertising the Europe Model 3 tour that we're doing after this
Interesting to hear considering its popularity in Scandinavia. I suppose they‚Äôre just more used to the difference in performance.
Concerning. Will take this into account when driving up later today.

Real question: how did OP get a British model 3? I thought they were only out in America so far. 
"/u/youyouxue said the same thing when he made this trip with his Model X, so perhaps it's something that actually does tempt him lol"
"Plenty.  Here's one interesting read https://greentransportation.info/energy-transportation/evs-need-clean-electricity.html

Even ignoring the fact that it is more efficient to burn fossil fuels centrally rather than distributed in car engines, the two big ones for me are 1. that it will never be possible to convert your ICE car to green energy generation by say sticking solar panels or a wind turbine on the roof, it is of course easily done centrally and 2. that by generating the power centrally even with fossil fuels, you're taking the pollutants out of heavily populated areas (i.e. the roads where you directly inhale the pollutants of each passing car)."
"The ‚Äúlong tailpipe‚Äù theory is not true. If you factor in everything, even in countries where electricity comes from 100% coal it is better (or similar) to use an electric car. This is because a coal power plant is still a lot more efficient than a car‚Äôs combustion engine. Don‚Äôt believe me, look it up for yourself."
"You've already gotten some good answers so I won't go nuts giving another. :)

When talking about long tail pipe, keep in mind that most oil is transported thousands of miles, refined in places that have incredible cancer rates, and then shipped again to your gas station.

Yes you have to move coal and such, but once power is generated you don't have to ship it on a vehicle."
"Yes. Morgan Stanley analysts found that Tesla is not really a green investment. With the reliance on coal power plants in the grid, they found that driving a Tesla actually contributes more to climate change than driving a regular gas powered engine.

"> 1% of the electricity in the US is produced directly from petroleum

...Mainly in Hawaii and Alaska."
"> 1% of the electricity in the US is produced directly from petroleum, so you have directly consumed 6.5 kWh of gas

A couple of mistakes in your assumptions. First being is you don't know where they charged and as such you don't know which power generation sources they used. with this being 1% it is extremely possible they didn't consume from any power plants that use petroleum. 

More than likely they used at least some from other fossil fuels, in fact I wouldn't be surprised if they hit more than the national % amount."

"Average coal plant thermodynamic efficiency is better than nearly all ICE engines out there (prius and a handful of hybrid engines non-withstanding).

Even accounting for delivery losses, 100% coal delivered power to a model 3 is more efficient on average than an ICE.

Then there's the reality, there's a lot of natgas out there (1/2 the emissions of coal on average), there's nuclear (20% of our power, no emissions), wind solar and hydro (especially when driving through the midwest), and we see there are a lot of factors, but in all cases the grid is cleaner than an ICE."

"There's a lot of very bad info in this thread about the performance of internal combustion engine vehicles in the cold compared to electric.  ICE engines (an abbreviation I've never heard before outside of this sub btw) perform perfectly fine in cold weather once they start.  People are confusing how long it takes the heater to warm up the car with how long it takes the engine to heat up.  They are not remotely the same thing and are not comparable.

In any case.  Any modern ICE car built in the last ten years should start in this weather without difficulty.  The engine warms up to an acceptable operating temperature within 2-5 minutes, and the cabin will warm up in about 5-10.  I don't think people understand how hot the interior of a car engine gets.

Electric cars are going to be plagued with both battery performance and cabin heating problems for the entire duration of the drive.  Sorry, but all electric technology is just not quite ready for extended operation in the cold.

But some of the comments in this thread about degraded engine performance in the cold are absurd.  Electric tech is new and exciting and filled with promise, but you have to accept that it's still new and there are a lot of edge cases and operating scenarios that still need to be worked out."

Because it is a better system of measurement in every conceivable way.

The US is also technically a metric country: the metric conversion act of 1975(?), However it made the switch voluntary for civilian organisations, and the general public refused to switch, demonstrating stubbornness. Apart from the government using it, there is more proof in the form of a random highway sign in Arizona, which is measured in kilometres. "
"I use metric for navigation, born and raised in New England. I just prefer kilometers. "

The same reason he is driving in the United States with a British license plate: he's clearly better than us.
"Minor nitpick: The US uses the US customary units and not imperial. Imperial is a thing that was developed after the American revolution and after the metric system. It's the widespread collection of units used throughout the old British empire (and now Commonwealth) but the American versions are even more ancient.

It wasn't until about 1959 that both the Brits and the Americans decided to harmonize their units using the metric system. "
"The US is technically not imperial, it uses USC (United states Customary).  Besides that the metric system has been fully legal for use since 1866 and since the 1970s, all of the major industries have metricated voluntary internally.  These include automotive, machine tool, heavy machinery, and their suppliers.  Also, the medical and nutritional industries are also almost fully metric.  

It isn't as visible as it should be but it is there none the less.  

Electric energy is sold to all customers in the units of kilowatt hours.  It should be joules to be true SI, but it isn't.  Thus any electrical device that consumes energy is going to be measured in watt or kilowatt hours.  
  "
"I drive in metric as well, in the US. Have been doing it for years. Took a bit of time to learn the cardinal speeds but then the rest is easy. Plus the Tesla helpfully points out the correct speed limit in km/h so you know how fast to go without having to look at signs."
I'd guess because it's easier to calculate in metric. Just move the comma instead of doing complicated multiplications

"Technically illegal to be wearing headphones (especially noise cancellers) while operating a motor vehicle.  Not sure if it's a primary offense; I've never seen someone get pulled over for it.

Edit: Oh I see what you're driving at.  Have the passenger wear the headphones and the driver just uses the car stereo.  Still gonna leave my post here in case anyone else misunderstands."

"And preheat the batteries. For short drives in winter electric vehicles are much better than ICE. There‚Äôs practically not any wear on the engine, while an ICE might even struggle to get warm.

"Depends on the state you are charging in, the rate at which you are charging, and the model you have or are planning to buy.

"> long road trips aren't as convenient as a gas car time-wise. 

You don't buy a Tesla to do long road trips. You buy a Tesla for the other advantages, and the superchargers are to enable/allow road trips for the <5% of the time you may need them.

A minor inconvenience for a very small amount of the driving time for most people isn't a deal breaker. Compare this to the Chevy Bolt, where you pretty much can't do a road trip on it. Those people will have to have a second car with an ICE engine (or a Tesla), or rent a car to do longer trips. Meanwhile the Tesla can do it, with some compromise, right now.

The types of people who want to get to their destination as soon as possible aren't going to buy a Tesla for road trips."

Wouldn't the battery heat up as it discharges? 
"not entirely true. in truly cold climates ICE cars have difficulty starting. Granted, that's a problem that's been solved via block heaters and finding a plug to plug them into but there is an initial startup problem that EV's don't have in comparison. An EV will simply drive immediately without warming up.

In many ways EV's are superior in cold. No problems starting. Heat instantly. In fact if you're in a cold climate chances are you set your nightly charging such that your car is ready and pre-warmed before you depart in the morning."

> has been insanely cold in the northeast seems like the cold really messes with multiple aspects of the car from range to super charging speeds. I sat at a super charger for 30 minutes getting 60 MPH charge rate... slowly creeping up to 100 MPH.. turns out the batteries have to be warmed up to get to super charging speeds. Mind you, i had driven for 20 minutes before the super charger and even that wasn't enough to warm the batteries.

"> ICE engines (an abbreviation I've never heard before outside of this sub btw) 


Huh, really? I've heard it usually in respect to talking about internal combustion engines when comparing them to something that isn't ICE. So the first time I actually ever heard about it was in the MechWarrior universe. Most higher class mechs had nuclear reactors of some kind, but some industrial mechs had ICE engines still. So its definitely rare, but I've definitely heard it outside this sub."
">Electric cars are going to be plagued with both battery performance and cabin heating problems for the entire duration of the drive.

I understand the battery performance issues, but what do you mean by cabin heating problems?  I've heard a lot of issues with Tesla performance in the cold, but this was never one of them..."
"They perform perfectly fine, but its well known that gas mileage is reduced by around 20% in the winter. "
"My transmission would like a word with you.
""Thump, pause, thud.""

OK.  Three words."
"This is only true when the engine is started cold as all the lubricants are thicker. Once it warms up, the engine is (perhaps negligibly) more efficient, but it definitely can make more power because of the colder intake air. I‚Äôve seen some say that there is more wind resistance because of the denser air, but that can hurt EVs more."
"An ICE gets lower MPG in cold conditions because of one major factor, and one very minor factor. The major factor is that people leave their car idling to warm up for 5 minutes before driving anywhere. That's literally burning fuel to accomplish zero movement.

The minor factor is that cold air is more dense, which requires more fuel to keep the proper A/F mixture. This is a minor change in most vehicles, and frankly unless your vehicle is tuned for your location it probably changes the consumption of a fraction of a percent."
Did you just start driving or something? Humans have been starting cars in cold weather for decades with no major issues.
"Yes.

My home heat pump is working at -28C.

Since I'm all-electric, they program it that way, as it's still more efficient. If my backup heat was natural gas, the heat pump would not be programmed to run so cold."
"This explains why in really hot environments when driving hard, the car sends all (or most) of the air conditioning to the battery. I noticed this driving through death valley last year. It was 125F outside and I was driving pretty hard and lost the A/C for a bit. "
"-29C would be extremely rare in areas where 95+% of Norwegians live, so I doubt you'd get a lot of stories from those temperatures on norwegian forums. The coldest ever recorded in Oslo is -26C (in 1941), and most ""densely"" populated areas have a warmer climate than Oslo in the winter"
"Not where the Tesla‚Äô are. Saw a shitload of Model S and X‚Äôs around Oslo and Bergen, where the temperature is currently hovering at freezing in the dead of winter. 

In fact the North Atlantic Current tends to keep the country relatively warm, the January average for Br√∏nn√∏ysund is -1.1¬∞C (30¬∞F), which is 14.6¬∞C (26.2¬∞F) higher than the average temperature for Nome, Alaska, despite sharing the same latitude. "

"In Kansas.

"actually it seems not to be particularly impractical in everyday situations (AFAIK). The problem arises in science, where metric units are vastly superioir, and in global uniformity, which saves a lot of money.


PS european metric user here"
"It is some Americans that cling to pre-metric units.  As I mentioned in a previous post, a large number of industries use metric internally.  It is a costly and confusing mess.  The opposers whine on about the cost, but no one looks at the long term cost of not metricating which by now would have paid for itself a million times over.  "
"Only problem is that it isn't ridiculously impractical... When the system was made it was intended for everyday use. Average stuff used in conversation. It serves that purpose extremely well. Pretty much all units of measurement are relative to an everyday object so you have a frame of reference.

"Yes, front plates required everywhere. Many countries allow for different sizes however, so if you can motivate a smaller size regulation plate due to lack of space, it is allowed. Audis can fit full size plates over the grille, but e.g. Alfas are often seen with small front plates attached to one side.  
  
Edit for clarification: The smaller plates are motorcycle plates, and uses the sizes regulated for those."
It would be cool if we could use the black ones still
Yup. We have too in Germany also. It‚Äôs a shame they‚Äôre not basically customisable like in the US.

In hindsight, you're right, people don't buy Teslas (at the moment) for long distance trips. I do hope they bring that super long range featured in the Roadster 2 into the X, S and 3 in the near future!"
"A Tesla.

Edit: I better explain because your comment was a bit angsty. We had a model 3 that had a motor issue, very very rare, Tesla were amazing and offered us a shiny new model s p85. The model S is in fact MORE uncomfortable in the back. Anyone scooting about in the front is fine and generally oblivious but the back is horrid for comfort.

Edit 2: there was more money involved but there were more added benefits to the package. It was a bargain for a Tesla."
">It sounds like a Model 3 might just not be for you. 

It's most definitely not for me. I like to take trips and it would be a miserable car to take on trips much less own. I'd prefer something with a better initial & lasting quality along with an interior that has more than a wheel & an iPad.

Rq = rhetorical question
More accurately additives are added to absorb any excess water that found its way in from freezing. The gas itself won't freeze until much much much colder.
It‚Äôs more like a chemical composition thing. Cold batteries physically don‚Äôt preform as well as a battery at something more.... mild . You‚Äôll have to ask a chemist for more details 
Electric cars are not superior to ice cars in the cold. The de-rating of the battery issue far outweighs the instant heat of a electric heater. Not to mention cars now have remote start so that‚Äôs not even a thing to compare . Plus my ice car has electric seat warmers so it‚Äôs hot as quick as it needs to be 
I assume he means lots of energy used to try to maintain heat in car reducing overall range significantly...
Gas mileage is actually improved in cold weather due to more dense air. 
"Mechanical engineer here... My fucking suzuki consumes more gas in winter than in summer. Thermodynamics suggest otherwise because of the increased temperature difference in the combustion chamber to the outside air. Still can't figure out why it's not more efficient. I haven't searched deeper either. I don't care now because I'm going electric as soon as they start shipping model 3's to Canada.

Edit: downvoted for sharing my experience with my 10 year old suzuki in winter in Canada. Way to go r/tesla. "
"Even if you don't idle to warm it, you still get lower efficiency during the early part of the drive as it warms up. EV's behave similarly in that once the battery is warm from use the efficiency loss is significantly reduced, though not removed altogether. The problem is that it takes them a lot longer to warm up. Of course you can use a battery heater in some cars, but that in itself uses energy, similarly to idling an ICE.
"
"Yes, but if you live somewhere with seriously cold weather it can become a problem. In somewhere like Fairbanks AK, for example, all the parking lots have power outlets to plug in block heaters & oil pan heaters etc.

Then switch again. 
It was 1975 and Gerald Ford was our President. I got to learn the Metric system from teachers that had no clue.  
"It's only because of deliberate limitation that it's not noticeable. Rather than the whole gamut of English units Americans limit themselves to just a handful.

So with personal weights it's pounds and for long distances it's miles. Temperatures are in degrees Fahrenheit. Complexity comes in with smaller magnitudes but those are limited as well. 

Personal heights feet and inches but very rarely anything smaller than that (1 cm is smaller than half an inch). Food items lighter than a pound are given in ounces but nothing smaller than that. And the ambiguity of volume ounces and weight ounces remains.

In order to almost fully alleviate the issues of working with these units Americans decimalize them. So it's not unusual to see 1.5' and 3.1 lbs buy 4.8 ounces or 12.395 gallons. "
That is absolutely right. But it was also long ago. I always used metric since I'm from Europe and only recently encountered the imperial system because most DIY YouTubers are from the US. It's a rather huge pain to convert everything if you want to build someone else's plans. Guessing sizes in metric is also easy for me since I have deeply memorized what a centimeter or a meter looks like. It's just a matter of using it enough in everyday life.

"Werner von Braun and the rest of operation Paperclip put a man on the moon using metric units throughout. The onboard computer on the Apollo missions did it's calculations in metric and then did a final conversion to American units for people to read.

Americans have always used US customary units and not imperial btw. "
I guarantee those calculations they did were in metric. 
No it didn't.  Wernher von Braun the father of NASA publicly stated he loathed USC and never used it.  He did all of his calculations in metric.  Hidden metric put man on the moon.
"Permit me to state that you referred to America, assuming nationality

"There are plenty of other factors that have much greater impacts on the whole ICE system efficiency than the base theoretical temperature differential efficiency.

For my short 6 mile commute this morning, it took 3 miles before my engine reached design temperature, so was running in open-loop mode (ignoring sensors and running rich) for a much longer time period than in warm weather. I averaged 10% lower MPG this morning than on warmer mornings."
"The ICE engine itself is quite efficient at operating temperature, but until it reaches it you‚Äôre using more fuel and getting more wear. For my short 20km drive to work there‚Äôs a noticeable difference in consumption. Certainly not anywhere near what small EV‚Äôs like the Leaf experience, but noticeable. 

On another note: Many diesels have auxiliary heaters because they‚Äôre too efficient and struggle to keep the engine at operating temperature while heating the cabin, these also burn fuel. 

Second factor is that when it‚Äôs cold you‚Äôre more likely to use more electricity which in turn puts the engine under greater load and raises consumption. This is also true for EV‚Äôs. While this might not be substantial for a car with an engine like mine (3.2 V6), you‚Äôll probably notice it more with smaller more efficient engines. On the other hand I use my engine heater to preheat the engine and cabin in the mornings, this uses both electricity and petrol. 

Another hit, for me at least, is actually that average speed is lower and less stable than in summer due to other motorists having variable levels of skills with the conditions, so you might find yourself stuck behind someone driving at 20-30% below the speed limit. For cars like mine that can easily be a big blow to fuel efficiency. "

"You‚Äôre really only using SCs when traveling long distances. Otherwise, for daily driving, plug in at home and charge overnight.

And I agree, charging at 300 mi/hr is nice (yet rare), but doubling that would make long road trips even shorter!"
"I'm waiting for the 800V charging. You'll have charge times drastically lower. And if you had 400 mile batteries you'll be able to pick up 250 miles of charge (on a ~ 10% battery) in 15 minutes or so, which is perfectly reasonable.

Also that same increase in air density results in more air resistance, negating anything you gain in combustion efficiency. There are a ton of factors involved. Even your oil viscosity will measurably reduce fuel economy. Of course you can change to a better winter oil but no one does this. "

"> you still get lower efficiency during the early part of the drive as it warms up

This is an even smaller impact than having colder air has on the vehicle. The overwhelming majority of the adjustments for cold engines are done in timing tables, and the vehicle is in closed-loop mode. Once the engine comes up to temperature, the ECU may go into open-loop mode but can fall back to closed loop mode in several conditions.

EVs do not behave similarly in any way whatsoever. The chemical reaction is slowed considerably and cell damage may happen at very cold temperatures. This is why your grandmother used to store batteries in her refrigerator. An ICE's chemical reaction actually happens more efficiently at colder temperatures, again because of the increased presence of oxygen.

The efficiency of a battery heating mode, like Tesla has (I'm sure others do as well, I'm just not knowledgable enough), is vastly superior to an ICE engine. The amount of wasted energy in burning gasoline, to spin a shaft doing no work so that the waste heat can warm the heat exchanger and radiator is ridiculous. The only thing that needs to happen with a production ICE vehicle when it's cold is that the oil needs to be warm enough to not be a gel. That's the entire point of a block heater. It warms the oil in the oil pan so the oil pump doesn't have to attempt to force sludge through the galleys before the engine scores a bearing journal or cylinder wall."
"I just recently drove from Alaska to the lower 48. While in Tok, AK my car wouldn't start due to the cold (-27 F). It was being trailered so it wasn't a big deal. My tow vehicle was plugged in and it wasn't an issue. But an EV would be next to impossible to rely on in those temps. "
Generally in closer climates you are also prepared for that. In Canada all cars are sold with block heaters so the only inconvenience is finding a plug in. And generally either you or one other person in the parking lot has booster cables and will be more than willing to take a couple minutes and give you a boost. 
How about the point being the comment I responded to sounds like its some huge problem.
"I know some of those ductless systems are insanely efficient, but working at -28C seems far fetched. Maybe -10C"

Compressor is on the other side of the wall of my bedroom, so I can hear it pretty plainly (although we spent extra for the quietest unit (Lennox) that they had.) "
Do you have information at what temperature heat pumps stop working or are no longer effective? It's a subject I'm interested in but it's difficult to find actual information with numbers. They seem to think temperatures never go below -10 C.
"This is how the HVAC guys programmed it. We've had it almost 5 years. It goes into defrost mode every so often. If I crank it 2-3 degrees up at once, the backup heat kicks on.

I don't use a lot of setback. We typically run the house at 20-20.5C in winter, 18.5 at night. I wear a sweater. (Wife doesn't like it too warm, and this is how we compromised on not opening a window in the middle of winter.)"
"Rural area. No natural gas. House originally had an oil furnace, and we did not want to replace it. Oil and propane are both available, both very expensive. The heat pump's very efficient. 

At these temps it does run quite a lot, but we have a wood stove that we run when it's like this."

"According to the Amnesty report Tesla gets the best rating from the electric car manufacturers in controlling their cobalt supply chain - so that it does not come from mining with inhumane conditions.

The report from Union of Concerned Scientists and others states that C02 emissions in the life-cycle analysis are lower then the most efficient of cars in the majority of places. Then there is the huge benefit of cleaner local air with a lot less nox, particles etc.

You are also missing one important part: The majority of all new added electricity generation is green([2/3 off all new power 2016](https://www.iea.org/publications/renewables2017/)). Modern batteries and cars are increasingly being produced with renewable energy, they run more and more on this green energy as well. Its pointless looking at emissions 10 years ago (which a lot of reports do and still favor electric cars) - look ahead during the life-time of the electric vehicles, in 10 years time from now they are going to be even more favorable than today!

You claim Tesla/electric cars are not environmental compared to ICE cars? You are simply wrong, and increasingly more wrong each year;)."

Tesla actually has a battery heater. It is worth the energy to heat the batteries up due to unlocked range. 
"I have never worried about my car starting and unfortunately I am smart enough to sit in the car while filling butttt I digress. Also, no matter how you swing it you can‚Äôt fight a cold battery is derated "
"The heat pumps used for cabin air afaik will simply not work when it gets to a certain cold temperature. They won't tell me what that temperature is. 

For typical heat pumps I've read -17 C. I live where it gets below -30 C, so in my mind they'll work until it gets cold out, which defeats it's purpose."
"Over short trips your efficiency will go down, but once the engine reaches operating temperatures it will go back up. Because of this frequent short trips will use much more fuel as they are running very rich. "
"I never idle my car in winter. I let it get hot while rolling. I ruled that one out. Though there's efficiency loss until all lubricants are at their service temperature. I couldn't quantify the loss about that portion but it couldn't be that important because I would see the same reduced range either if I started the car in winter a few times or lots of times between fills. It showed me it wasn't a factor.

About the winter and summer blend.. I have to check that out. "
"Some company that does high water jet pressure cutting for the paper industry. Not making a pretty penny yet, respectable but not there yet so I'm not calling victory on the model 3 yet. They need to offer a similar financing that they currently have for the model S in Quebec. That's 96 months at 2%. Also that the base price is similar to what the Bolt is from the us price to the Canadian price. The Bolt is 37k$ us and they sell it in the ballpark of 45k$ canadian. So I'm banking on the relativeness of that to hope for a 42k$ canadian model 3. If you add the 8k$ of the Quebec province ev incentive then that brings monthly payments in the 450$ ballpark. That's my absolute maximum budget with taxes and all. So I'm crossing all fingers and my little suzuki needs to last one more year. The poor bastard, I wouldn't let it die. "
I would be sooooooo disappointed if it was something like the bearing grease eating away my mileage in winter. Either that or a nervous breakdown laugh. 
Not spinning the wheels more. It's not always icy. I ruled that one out a long time ago. Had to do a lot  high way for two years. Great road conditions between fill ups and still would consume more gas in winter vs summer. 
For sure. I imagine EVs would need a plug-in battery heater similarly to ICEs.
"Except the Tesla S and X have a system that the batteries are kept at the proper temperature when it is too cold outside.

Although that results in the battery draining. Not sure how much energy would be used, but I imagine if you keep the batteries topped up every day it wouldn't be a problem.

So it shouldn't be as worse as you imagine."
"For sure. It's a problem that's been solved, but i was just noting that it's not entirely a non-issue even with ICEs. "
"I usually see figures like 14 F, so that's about right."
Running most of that time isn't efficient.  I would expect you to be running on supplemental heat as well.
From my experience they will work at colder temps. It's just not very efficient. 
So no solar?

"not exactly. In the US, the scientific community (aerospace, chemistry, etc) uses metric."
"Is the ""mpg"" actually stated using Imperial or US gallons? An Imperial gallon is based on the volume of 10lbs of water at 62¬∞F, ‚âà 4.546L. The US gallon is 231in^3 ‚âà 3.785L.

So, in theory, with about 760mL more fuel, the stated mpg figure for a car in the UK should be higher than the same car in the US."
The biggest problem is the conversion back and forth. If the US would completely switch to metric we would have a standardized system for the whole planet. In everydays use it doesn't matter if you don't interact with outsiders

"I don't think that the derivation from a thumb or a foot or whatever is what makes it practical or impractical.

The practicality or impracticality rather arises from conversion of units into each other within the same system.

In the metric system it is always factors of ten. As the whole world (virtually) uses a ten-based numbering system, clearly using a unit system that makes conversion as simple as shifting the decimal point is great.

The imperial system, on the other hand, uses arbitrary conversion factors. A cup holds ... ehhh ... I can't remember how many ounces, whatever. A few I suppose. I'm not a freakin' chef.
Different example: a foot has 12 inches, but a yard has 3 feet. A mile however, has 1760 feet, and 63360 inches. Rofl."

It's also interesting when they compare a huge Tesla to a small hybrid vehicle. Here is map of MPGs required per state to beat an electric car: [map](https://electrek.co/2017/06/05/electric-cars-cleaner-than-gas-powered/).

The report also ignores the Tesla [giga-factory](https://www.tesla.com/sv_SE/gigafactory)  which will use 100% renewable energy. 

In my case that is not an issue since we get 97% of our electricity from water and nuclear around here. If an electric car owner lives on coal-country they should get solar - which many of them do. That's also something they ignore with the report, they just take the average of all electricity generated by coal in the US and assume its the same wherever you are, in reality it of course differs greatly from where you live.

Its about time the concept of cars only being sold through dealers was eradicated for good. Let the market decide. 
"Maybe the big automakers: Toyota, Chevy, Honda, Ford, etc start putting out their own showrooms and their own certified car repair shops rather than having to pay middlemen to abuse the customer.  Sounds like more jobs to me.

Big car dealerships with their cronenberg service shops dug their own grave by hiring masterful psychological manipulators to put the customer last.  Their reign of terror has ended.  Car salesman with a masters degree in high-pressure psychological manipulation treating their customers like crap: find a different job!  People don't like to be treated like a chump when they want to buy a brand new car or lose 2 days of effort every time the car needs a simple service."
"> Lawyers from the state Division of Motor Vehicles concluded that state law barring auto manufacturers from selling directly to consumers was only applicable to franchise auto dealers and not Tesla, who operates independently through company-owned stores.

This determination of applicability must be based on the crazy wording of the law in RI.

In Michigan, taxes is a non-motivator.  Michigan calls it ""use-tax"" on vehicle  titles transferred from out of state and collects the money either way.


I'd still like Tesla to challenge the entire franchise law from a the standpoint that the franchise laws themselves are unconstitutional and a violation of some federal commerce law, which would effectively kill them in all states.   There is no news of that legal strategy (if it's even possible).

RI law offers a $2500 rebate and shows a commitment to EVs in RI, but without funding it actually offers nothing, and this needs to be addressed.  In fact, the taxes in the first year on a new Model 3 (sales+property) in Providence are $5000, and another 6% of the car's price every year thereafter.  $10,000 in taxes in the first 3 years.

The price the dealer paid to the manufacturer is fixed. Most states mandate equal pricing by manufacturers to all their dealers. So the only point to negotiate is the dealer‚Äôs margin. They tell you they‚Äôre getting you the best deal from the manufacturer but it‚Äôs a lie because that ship has sailed and there is no (and practically speaking cannot be any) negotiating of the dealer‚Äôs price.

I get the impression the manufacturers won't try to rock the boat with their dealer networks because it's the system they have and they're so entrenched and politically active, but if they could sell their own cars directly, they'd be all for it."

"Who would that be noncompetitive to? The manufacturers? The dealers? Tesla?

Also, remember guys don't downvote because you disagree. This is why we have a reputation for being cult-like."
Can you elaborate a little on ordering directly from Honda? I purchased my first car a few years ago through a dealership and it was one of the worst experiences in my life. 
"No because small goods manufacturers can choose to sell their products directly if they want to.  If Dell wants to sell a computer directly, they can put up a website and completely bypass walmart and that's totally legal.  Choice is good.  Cost to me is minimized because I can buy a computer through a website and have it shipped to me.

The problem arises because the big 5 automakers are legally not allowed to put up a website and sell their cars directly to consumers.  If Toyota, Chevy, Honda or Ford made their own brick and mortar ""Car store"" or they put up a website where you could ""click to buy a car"" and have it delivered, the police would run in and start arresting everyone for breaking the law.  Basically Dealerships became a kind of Mafia, by shutting down all competition, and by resting on their prior victories, they let their usefulness to soceity deteriorate past the point of being minimally helpful, and became a useless parasite on the system.  Taking value, but not returning any value.

See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMWmYJOa-BM

I think walmart is half good and half bad.  Good because they keep costs down and streamline customer goods acquisition system, but bad in that they eliminated tens of millions of jobs over the last 30 years by economies of scale, automation and the jobs they replaced it with are soul crushing minimum wage ones.  

What I do hate are car dealerships, they need to be disrupted away.  And the Tesla company will grow faster than competitors when people realize that Dealerships have no redeeming quality, and only introduce damage to the whole system.  Why would you be a masochist and go to a dealership to be psychologically abused when you can have a delightful experience buying a Tesla online, or at one of their dedicated stores, and using Tesla's vehicle transport system to make car repair a matter of a phone call plus pickup.  No more standing in long lines at dealerships and wasting 2 of your days to fix your own car!

The American government has done well by getting out of the way of Tesla, and will be rewarded with long term return on investment through greater GDP growth thus tax revenue increases.  Everyone wins except for the entrenched dealerships who dug their own graves."
Could you imagine having to go to a different website for *every single item* on your shopping list? And ordering them individually? I'll pass.

"Simple answer: because they sell 200x the number of Subaru‚Äôs in Colorado versus Mississippi. Colorado dealers get them cheaper. I know this is specialized, but it‚Äôs one example."
"That's what I'm going through now.

I try to keep my offers reasonable because they're in business to stay in business and the salesman has bills to pay but they always come back with something 2-3k higher than my offer, just shy of MSRP.

I know the sales people aren't going to go hungry because they'll at least make a mini-deal on every car sold but I'm sure not going to be the one they make up the rest of their month on. Hopefully someday dealers will be able to sell direct with transparent pricing but I really don't see that happening with the automotive lobby around."

No no no. We wait until they almost fail. Then we bail them out because they are too big to fail or whatever. The companies then give huge bonuses to the CEOs that secured the free govt money as they failed as a CEO 
"No, the problem isn't that companies need to adapt or die.  The problem is that the whole basis of the dealership model is based on a promise of Do Not Compete by the manufacturer.  When the car companies started, they couldn't afford to establish direct sales and service centers in 1000s of markets.  Just look at the massive amount of capital that Tesla is spending to do so.  And they have the supreme advantage of online sales to help reduce their needs to serve a given market.  So, instead of doing it themselves which would have been totally financially impossible they decided to franchise.  That breaks up the capital investment into many, many, many smaller pieces which are individually within reach.  And allows the manufacturer to work on expanding production.  So, the franchisee takes the risk of creating and growing the market for the cars.  If, after the market was established, the producer could come in and start selling they would be able to undercut the franchisee 100% of the time due to scale and the ability to take a short term loss in a specific market to push their franchised ""competition"" out.  Essentially, once they had decided to franchise, if they were ever allowed to sell direct wouldn't have been fair competition.  

My point wasn't about other car companies competing with Tesla.  It was about Ford competing with your local Ford dealership.  That's one that the dealer is going to lose every time.  It doesn't matter that your local provider might be better than Ford or provide a better service.  They can just undercut the prices by enough to force them out of the market.  Of course, once they have the market to themselves they don't need to keep prices low anymore."
"To the existing dealers. The Ford Dealer can't compete with Ford selling direct. Not when Ford sets the prices for both the dealer and the consumer. You choice is to buy from Ford for $25k or buy from the dealer for $25k plus whatever markup they add to cover overhead and profit. Consumers would never go to the dealer.

Direct sales WILL put dealers out of business. The result will be slightly lower prices for the consumer, but will also cost lots of jobs."
"Build and price online through the dealerships ordering system. They pick and choose some of the cars, so that‚Äôs how we got this one sent in. The only hard part is having a friend that will let you pick the options "
"You think manufacturers want to bypass dealers? Why would you think that?

And i dont know in which kind of dealerships you go but they always had good customer service. Also its ironic when you speak of ‚ÄûNo more standing in long lines at dealerships and wasting 2 of your days to fix your own car!‚Äú when in reality you will wait for months if your Tesla has a damage."
"Dealers do sell what‚Äôs available today for convenience but they can also sell you exactly what you want too.

You can order it custom but just like Tesla you won‚Äôt get it that day though and it will take around 6 weeks. 

I thought this was common knowledge. 

If Tesla had their own direct to customer dealerships with cars, they‚Äôd have the same set up with a bunch of cars and the option to do customization. Of course they don‚Äôt have a machine that builds to cars on location in an hour so just like dealerships today, you‚Äôd still have to wait 6 weeks. "
"If it was a manufacturer owned lot, then it‚Äôs different. Someone who isn‚Äôt looking for anything in particular can pick between a handful of Honda Fits and go with whichever one is okay to them. For my family, what‚Äôs available today does the trick. In my case, the only reason I didn‚Äôt go with that is because the civic hatchback didn‚Äôt  hit the U.S. shores yet, so I just set my ideal car up to be shipped in when they came"
"Is that true? I've lived in NY and MD. Whenever I buy a car out of state (I've bought them in NJ, Penn, NC, and probably a few others I can't remember) I never pay sales tax at the time of purchase. I have always paid tax at the time of registration.

Sure, if I register a car in the state I buy it in, then transfer it to NY or MD, they'll charge me the difference unless I can show a long period of ownership, but unless I have a residence in the state I bought it in, I would never register it there."
Beat me to it.  Use tax is just to make sure that adjacent states don't have an incentive to undercut each other.

This is the part I find infuriating. I get that the manufacturer and the dealer aren't the same company, but being caught in the middle of this sucks. 

The dealer knows the numbers, I don't. He knows he's *actually* earning $1k on my sale and helping himself towards that bonus even as he's telling me I'm asking for something unreasonable, or he knows that I'm asking for something nobody will do and his first price was actually fair even though I'm negotiating simply because I've learned all dealers are liars. I don't want to be taken advantage of, but I want him to get his sale and put food on his family's table. "
">On average a car dealer has a single digit profit percentage on the vehicles they sell.

As do banks, and real estates. When dealing with large prices a small percentage is still a lot of money."
"Well ok, set price per state then. I mean why do dealers insist on the bullshit game?

If they ask $25k but make money down to $23k and actually expect an average price of $24k, why not just set the price to $24k and save everyone the ""let me talk to my manager"" crap?"

You cannot be serious, car dealerships are one of the most distrusted, and literally most hated commercial establishments in the U.S.A.:

Here's a result of an opinion poll that lists the [top 10 reasons of why car buyers are unhappy with car dealerships](http://www.cross-check.com/blog/harris-poll-top-10-reasons-buyers-are-unhappy-with-auto-dealerships):

> **Consumer Dissatisfaction with Auto Dealerships**

>
> 87% dislike ‚Äúsomething‚Äù about the process of shopping at auto dealerships

> 34% of 18-to-24-year-olds would rather wait in line at the DMV
>
> 24% of the 35‚Äì44 demographic **prefer to get a root canal**
>
> 52% of all age groups **feel anxious or uncomfortable at auto dealerships**
>
> 61% **hate the auto shopping experience**
>
> 54% would love to buy or sell a car without leaving home
>
> 42% would feel comfortable buying a car online without a test drive if incentives were included
>
> 33% of women (37% of Millennial women) **dislike being spoken to disrespectfully at dealerships**
>
> 62% of Millennial women **felt pressured by a dealership salesperson** (vs. 50% of men)

The main reason why people still go to car dealerships is because they must: through protectionist legislation dealerships have a virtual monopoly on selling cars in most states.

"Hey, I‚Äôve just gotten an anecdotal encounter that follows just this line. 

I‚Äôve got an older Honda CR-V with the ‚ÄúMight kill you, might not‚Äù airbag that I keep getting recall notices about. Over the past few months I‚Äôve set up 4 appointments that they kept calling and cancelling because they put ‚Äúmy‚Äù replacement part on another car. Finally this Monday came and I hadn‚Äôt gotten a cancellation call, so I arranged to have my fianc√©e follow me to the dealership so I could drop off my car and then go to work.

I get there 20 minutes after their service office opens, no-body in sight. Hit the bell a few times, no response. So I walk over to their sales office, fianc√©e driving slowly behind me. The moment I hit the door I‚Äôm greeted with the perfect Simpson‚Äôs representation of car salesman. It took a couple of rounds of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for recall service, can you help me find service staff.‚Äù  He moped back to his desk and just does an open page and tells me that will do it. 

So I go back to the service office and there‚Äôs a guy waiting on me. He takes my key and let‚Äôs me know it‚Äôs a quick fix, it‚Äôll be done in under an hour. So I go out and tell my fianc√©e that she can head out, no need to wait around on me to then just drive back again. So then I wait. After an hour my car is still parked in their bay, but nobody‚Äôs touched it and it‚Äôs a ghost town again. Ding the bell again, shout, nothing. So I go back to the sales office and ask the same excitable salesman if something is going on. Another round of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not buying anything‚Äù and he pages the whole office again. I go back to the service office and a different Tech is there, says my car isn‚Äôt even checked in, and that it‚Äôll probably be 4 hours until it‚Äôs ready to go. BUT THANKFULLY they have a shuttle service that can run me to my office. So away I go, let my boss know the issues, we laugh at how bad dealerships are. 

At the end of the day a co-worker that lives on that side of town offers to take me to the dealership to pick up my car, since 8 hours is more than 4 it should be done. Except it isn‚Äôt. They didn‚Äôt order the right kit for my car, but had ordered it for the latest model CR-V, but didn‚Äôt discover that until the dash was apart. They‚Äôre overnighting the part and it‚Äôll be the first thing done on Tuesday.  By this point my co-worker has taken off and the shuttle driver is off work. Best they can do is rent me a loaner car. I‚Äôm not happy with that and call my fianc√©e, she‚Äôs in the middle of something and can‚Äôt be to the dealership for an hour, but that‚Äôs better than nothing. So I go wander the lot looking at shiny things. 3 different sales vultures come by and ask what I‚Äôm looking for, only to get dejected that I‚Äôm not there to buy, with one of them continuing to pressure me into looking at this new off the truck car that he‚Äôs sure we can come up with a payment plan for. 

Finally saved by my fianc√©e who is upset on my behalf at how fucked this situation has gotten. I arrange alternate transport to work for Tuesday and give th service office a call around 10 to see when they expect my car to be done. ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs done and ready to roll whenever you are.‚Äù So I arrange for the shuttle guy to come and get me. Back to the empty service office and over to sales for the page then back to service. Find out that ‚Äúdone and ready to roll‚Äù ACTUALLY means almost done. Another half hour waiting around before I get my keys and can leave. 

So yeah, everything about that experience was sub-par. Every chance that they had to convert the bad experience to a good one was walked wide by. They could have arranged an overnight ‚Äútest drive ;)‚Äù so I didn‚Äôt have to wait forever, they could have tossed in oil changes or something dumb as an apology for the pushed back dates. Or just an apology at any point. Instead I felt I was seen as a cost to them and not even decent enough to sit down with a finance manager to see just what I might buy. "

"I would highly doubt the sales person or the dealer make $1000 purely from the sale of a vehicle.  Unless the dealer has marked it up crazy (which will show up on the window label). 

See what the label says for MSRP and use that as a fair number. I had a sales manager tell an indian family to ‚Äúget the fuck out of here‚Äù because they kept insisting the dealer in the next town over was offering 5000 below MSRP on the car and we should offer 6000 below. Fuck that. With accessories and MSRP we would‚Äôve been 10 grand underwater on one car. 

Keep in mind TRIM LEVELS matter. Comparing a Honda Civic DX (crank windows and no a/c) to a Honda Civic EX-L Touring (heated steering wheel and personal chauffeur)  is foolish and caused more misunderstandings than anything else.   The price difference is staggering (18k up to about 32k) even before it gets to the dealer. 

Edit: why do people always downvote facts from a reliable source? Because they don‚Äôt like dealerships?"
"Because its planted in people minds now they hae ti play the game, so dealers expect negotiations and account for it in the listed price."
"maybe Because they're competing against other dealerships? not sure. 

 if anyone had the same price there would be no need to shop around and go to their dealership, they'll have to compete on intangibles like better service, warranty etc. and it will be a race to the bottom for them. 

everyone will end up going to the same one dealership in their area.

also maybe selling cars in real price (24k) wouldn't be enough to sustain their business. 

"
Same reason there are sales. People want things cheaper. Most think it's on sale it must be cheaper when it reality sometimes it's not or maybe only .01 cheaper.

"If Ford had never used a franchised dealer to establish a market for their products, then there would be no problem.  The problem comes about because Ford couldn't afford to create those markets.  The upfront investment to do so over a wide area was just way too high.  Or, attempting to do so would enforce such a slow expansion that they couldn't effectively compete with other car companies.  It would limit them to being a niche product with a very limited geographical footprint.  Imagine if the only Ford ""stores"" were in Chicago or Detroit.  The only way to buy one would be to go there first.  It would seriously limit their pool of potential customers.  So, in order to capture market share over a wide geography, they established a different business model.  The franchised dealership.  

That business model works by making a trade between the manufacturer and the dealer.  The dealer makes the investment needed to establish a demand for the product and building up sales and repair to service that demand.  So, they are taking on both all the market risk that there will be sufficient local demand for the product and the upfront capital costs involved with any large retail business.  The manufacturer essentially gets all that for free.  But part of the deal is that they can't come into that market after the fact.  Once all the work has already been done to create a local demand for their product, there'd be basically no risk for them to establish a ""store"" that automatically would put the dealer out of business.

"I did pay about $1000 over MSRP, but it was one of the first Civic hatchbacks in my area, so that‚Äôs cool"
"How is this trolling if i am just askin legitimate questions?

Do you want everyone here to gag on Elons cock?"
"Actually manufacturers are unsure what they want. It‚Äôs one thing to organically grow a direct sales model, it‚Äôs another to try to shift to it. Don‚Äôt feel bad for them. I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs more complicated. They‚Äôre simply not ready, and to-date not truly willing, to make the investment required for direct sales. The most talked about ‚Äòsolution‚Äô for manufacturers is to allow them to create a line-make that can have direct sales. If Saturn could come back as all electric with a separate sales model that can be organically grown from the ground up, that‚Äôs a viable path. But to think GM is itching to suddenly go into the business of owning and operating its own dealerships, that‚Äôs just not the case. "
That is some Comcast level fuckery right there. Much respect for not completely losing your shit. 
"They might not want to do it but the last time I had a dealer do it they did it without question.  They did try to offer me a couple of similar cars on their lot, but they got me the car I wanted once I told them that those wouldn't do."
"Custom orders you just do online and don‚Äôt talk to someone until the paperwork. Then it‚Äôs already done and they can‚Äôt really tell you no unless you don‚Äôt meet the specifications, but if that‚Äôs the case, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to buy a car anyway. 

As for dealer trades, just say, okay, I‚Äôll go over there then, and they are pretty much guaranteed to do it because it‚Äôs either lose business or do business. 

One time I told a used dealership about a car I liked and they flew some guy to buy one up north, I didn‚Äôt even ask or say I was going. I didn‚Äôt even buy the car at the end of it. "

"The last ICE I bought (Porsche) the salesman just so happened to walk out of the room as I was discussing numbers with him, part of that whole ""I need to go talk to my manager"" song and dance they do to waste time.  He left his computer unlocked with my car's information up.  I then knew EXACTLY what they paid for the car.  I offered $1000 more than that, stood on it, they said no... so I ordered another car for that same $1000 over price at another dealership.  Deal accepted instantly.  I loved the car and felt I got a good price and they made a fair profit as a middle man, but I don't miss that whole middleman part at all."
"Right, because the price of ""window etching"" et. al., which is included on that label,  is ***completely*** fair. /s

Why are you surprised that people hate sleazy stressful dealerships? That has nothing to do with Tesla. Dealerships are a perfect example of cronyism.

"Sure, they could have a contractually binding non-compete clause.  But Ford could also just decide to stop providing cars to a dealership until it went out of business then move in.  The problem has nothing to do with competition between different car brands.  It's strictly about potential competition between a parent brand company and its dealerships.  The problem is that when Ford/GM/etc. first started there was no way that they could try to do what Tesla is doing.  Or they could but it would have doomed each company to being a small regional brand.  The only reason you can go buy one of those cars in your local area is because of the dealership model.  That doesn't make that business model perfect, but to have relied on it to establish all of its benefits and then to turn around ignore those same benefits while bitching and moaning about its warts is the height of obliviousness.

And it's not because McDonalds puts out a superior product.  Or why through their first 15 years--when they had no franchises--Five Guys burgers had opened a total of 5 locations, all close to their original restaurant.  And in the following 15 years--once they started franchising--they opened ~1500.  Without franchising, the only way you would ever have heard of them was because you lived near Washington DC.  "

Every grocery store pays different amounts for different things too. I don't understand why you think cars are so different. The price on the sticker, plus applicable sales tax, should be what you pay to drive off in that car, period. Make it a bit lower and stop the mind games, everybody wins. "
"I think they legally have to give the final price on the sticker, in canada at least. "
"Those are good burgers, Walter."
"Your problem is twofold, you're trolling and you're unable or unwilling to admit it.  

Valid criticism is fine, but every time you've typed a question mark has been to cover up a lie you made just to elicit a reaction.  Why do think murder is OK?

Now, you're not ignorant.  Future trolling is intentional and you can't pretend otherwise.  Act like an thinking adult or leave.

"
"True.  I am also surprised at how different the deals can be.  One dealer is looking to score like $4000 profit on a deal and will settle for no less, and the other is fine with $1000 and completes the deal in an hour.  "
The dealer doesn't print out the sticker.
One dealer can be 2-3 cars away from hitting their mark and the other could be 2-3 over it.
"Oh ok pack it up then, there is no possible solution to that. I didn't realize dealers don't have printers, can't make their own signs, and can't in any way shape or form think of a workaround given that they get a sticker with MSRP on it. "
"It's a federally mandated sticker.  

Are you incapable of asking what the local and documentation fees are?"
"You still don't get it, at all. 

I'm asking them to stop with the haggling and be clear about the damn price. 

Leave the MSRP sticker. I don't care. 

Put up a sign that says ""this car has an MSRP of $26k but we are selling it as follows:

* With no accessories, including all fees: $25k

* Snow tires: $600

* Floor mats: ...""

No more haggling. No more bullshit first offers that if you don't walk away from you're a moron. No more pretending to talk to the manager. No more ""if you get this and this I can work with you on the financing"" bullshit. No more ""yeah we can do $20k... By the way there's a $4k fuck-you fee."" Just a clear, fair price."
"...they have those signs, they're called amendment stickers.

You can go to any bank and apply for your own financing, and what dealer has 4k in documentation fees?"
"Got it Dec 24th, been a fantastic car. Went to drive it this morning and nothing would wake it up. Tesla Service couldn't ping it or reboot remotely either.

Currently at the service center. Will post follow up."
You have too many windows open. Try closing some.
"Some follow-up details:

Service person checked the 12V battery, fully charged:

https://i.imgur.com/UhuTfzx.jpg

We did get a free loaner car from Service. 
No ETA yet from Tesla, they'll contact us Monday with more information.

https://i.imgur.com/uZu7bu3.jpg

The system to lock/unlock, open trunk, open/close windows and turn on headlights is separate from the core system to drive it. That is new to the Model 3.

It was difficult to get the car out of the garage. We have a narrow courtyard, and the only tow point on the car is in the front, so the driver put dollies under the rear wheels, I rolled down the windows and then 3 of us pulled the car out by hand."
"One thing I learned is there are multiple levels of reboot, at least according to what the service folks tried with us.  30 seconds of pressing in the scroll wheels is first, then hold brake and press scroll wheels is 2nd, pump brake 5 times then hold scroll wheels for 1 minute is 3rd."
Try disconnecting and reconnecting the battery. Also can I have your car if you die trying this? Thanks. 
Yikes. Hopefully it's fixed for you soon and that the issue isn't too widespread. Keep us updated!
Damn is this the 3rd one recently?
"Seems like a lot of negative attention. I'm a huge Audi fan. Unfortunately they made thousands of cars with 2.0 engines from 2009-2012 that burned a quart of oil every 500 miles. No apologies. I remember Honda had multiple transmission issues in the 90's-2004.  Ford had multiple EGR problems. Toyota vans with power sliding doors requiring 2k repairs. GM ignition problems. Toyota cars with cracked exhaust manifolds. Power antenna mast issues from every OEM. Ford 6.0 diesel motor was quite possibly the worst diesel ever produced 2003-2009.  My first ASE Master Tech certification was in 1993 and my first Honda Master Tech certification was 1994. Worked as a line mechanic at Honda for six years then owned a autobody and service business. A lifetime of fixing cars and dealing with OEM's.  I don't believe any of Tesla's problems begin to approach the lack of integrity I've seen in a lifetime of watching OEM's fuck lifetime loyal customers. 2 kids in college or I would have 2 brand new Tesla's sitting in my driveway.

"Just curious, why do you have a commercial ‚Äòno parking‚Äô curb signage on your own driveway?"
Thanks for beta testing this for me. Hope all kinks are ironed out by the time I get mine. (currently scheduled by the end of the year)
"Off topic, but I really love that color. Best one imho."
"OK, latest update. 

They need more time. Scheduled pick up is next Saturday (I've got some conferences to present at and won't be able to pick up earlier even if ready).


Basically it's a non-trivial problem of why it's not responding to either local or over the air attempts to communicate."

"I know 3 other Tesla owners (Model S, two newer makes and one older). They all have constant mechanical issues. A few years back I was all gung-ho about throwing money towards my first Tesla. But now... not so much. It's like being in a really expensive pilot project."
12v battery or DC to DC converter failed maybe?
So ... forgive me for not already knowing this when I probably should .. but .. if you're parked in your garage and it's dead .. how do you put it in neutral to at least push it out?  I have a 90-degree garage/driveway scenario so not sure how a tow truck would be able to do anything is she died on me there....
"Wednesday evening update. Still haven't diagnosed the problem. I asked if they'd isolated it to a specific component, they said not yet."
"I love Tesla but how is it possible to still have these problems? They've released 3 cars prior to this, the battery technology is the same, no?"
Keep us posted!

Over time, the production will become more refined. The kinks will be worked out. Issues like this won‚Äôt happen. But for them to not happen, they need to happen to someone first, and that is you my guy. I‚Äôm sorry it was you. It‚Äôs probably infuriating and upsetting. You‚Äôre pioneering the product and clearing the path for someone who will by a more reliable version of this product in the near future. "

"This is a good time to remind people to back into packing spaces and their garage if they can. It not only is safer when leaving the parking space, but it helps with towing. "

You need to 30 seconds press in the scroll wheel, while also simultaneously holding down the drivers side window button for 10 seconds. Let after letting go of the driver side window button, press and hold down the passenger side window button, also for  10 seconds. 
Then as you‚Äôve released both the driver and passenger side window buttons you should have a remaining 10 seconds left to hold the scroll button. 
Following this you‚Äôll here a gentle harp strum, kinda like on BMW‚Äôs, indicating on the screen to press accept for reboot.

OP and his car will match: dead.
I love Reddit!
"""This is IT, have you tried turning it off and on?"""
"Yes.  One was already delivered and had a high voltage controller fail.  The other one, just posted the other day, was supposedly a drive unit failure - it was on a vehicle that was pending delivery (next day) and that was the reason the delivery specialist gave him that they could not deliver it.

Seeing the frequency of these failures occur as they're trying to ramp does give me a moment of pause, if I'm being honest.  Hopefully the ramp does not coincide with a decrease in quality."
How is it percentage-wise from other new releases?
3 total failures in 3000 cars?  So 1000 failures in a million - thats a PPM of  1000 when the industry standard is about 50-75 PPM.
I live in Canada and reserved a model 3.  I'm on edge about it because I work night shifts and it's going to be left outside in -20 unplugged.  I'm worried this will be a bad arrangement. 
"most folks in this thread are ignoring this. every manufacturer has issues.

a lot of ignorant thoughts in this thread, sad"
"All brands have them, 10 year old german cars also have a major rust problem for some reason, Toyota (Previa) and Nissan Navara/Frontier have troubles with their turbo diesels (google nackered Navara). For Nissan it was something completely wrong with their conrods. We were told by Nissan it was 2% chance of engine failure. Welp, we were the 2% then and Nissan and the importers refused to help most people.  

While googling the Navara stuff I found [This about their newer Navara](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2791663/nissan-navara-safety-fears/). 

If you want a car that never dies I will sign in blood that the Corolla  1995 are bullet proof. Non-interference engine too so you can (if you insist) drive until the timing belt snaps and nothing happens. "
"> worst diesel

I think the diesel out of a gas engine 350 Olds V8 has the low point for diesels. 

I agree fully that Tesla is handling the problems as best it can as opposed to avoiding them like so many manufacturers.

"Not commercial at all. In California, all no parking striping is red (vs yellow or green or white for other messages).

Looks like a gated community with no driveways and narrow roads = no parking outside the garage 
"
"Because If anyone parked there, they would block him in?"
Condo or townhouse? They often have these.
If you look at the home across the street from him it look like they might have very small setbacks so that could be the sidewalk there so it is marked since it is unusual. Just a guess.
That's not uncommon in the Bay Area. 
"I thought it was a fire access requirement, not a commercial thing."
"My biggest fear is getting mine, something goes wrong and they take months to fix it due to parts shortages or service backup.  Tesla either needs to be prepared to fix issues quickly or provide loaner cars."
Whend you order yours? 
Do you know if it's power related or perhaps comms/computer?
That is actually my happy face.
"Most likely reason, sounds logical. I think reddit has done it again!

Friendly advice to OP: Just because you CAN park you car upside down, doesn't mean you should do it."
"I think Tesla vehicles are awesome but the out of warranty repairs and their growing pains scare the shit out of me. Pain in the fucking ass to get replacement parts, Tesla locks down all repair tools/documentation so that only they can repair your vehicle, pain in the ass at times to schedule repairs (so fuck you if you don't live near a service center) because you can only get repairs at Tesla on their schedule. 

One of my friends used to work at the Fremont factory and she had like four different drive units, like four or five doorhandle replacements, and a battery pack replacement on her S before she said fuck it and lemon lawed it."
"My model S ludicrous mode has had no problems whatsoever. None. In my 4th year of ownership.

Still gets 250 mile range on full and still launches at around 2.6 seconds for 0-60. "
">It's like being in a really expensive pilot project.

"I just really don‚Äôt understand how they can be so bad at manufacturing. I do automation manufacturing for a living and if they had any skilled engineers whatsoever, they should not be having all these issues."
"I'm on my second model S, 6 years of ownership overall. Not one single issue. That's not true, the sun visor broke in my old one. That was it. "
"Considering he managed to get in (I.e. key card sensor worked), I‚Äôm guessing some systems are independent. Perhaps that gear lever still worked. "
Tow truck drivers have dolly wheels that they can put under a car's wheels...can push a car sideways if needed.  Technology courtesy of the repo business.
If you can at least get the 12v to supply power you can put the vehicle in tow mode.  Better chock the wheels. If it's totally dead you're screwed.
There‚Äôs always going to be issues with a car first being released. When I worked for BMW we had multiple failures in our cars and we had been doing it for 100+ years haha. Tesla is really one of the few companies that has such an intense following that these failures are much more publicized. 
"No, the battery technology is a completely different configuration from cells to bricks to packs, the lithium ion chemistry is the same but all else is new. And the motor uses permanent magnets. And the charging electronics are newly redesigned. And the primary computer is new.

That‚Äôs how it is possible."
It wouldn‚Äôt matter if they produced the same thing millions of times. There will always be defects. 
"AFAIK, the battery tech plays no role here. The computers work off the 12V bus supplied by the 12V battery. There‚Äôs a DC-DC converter that charges the 12V battery from the HV bus, but nothing on the HV side works without the 12V supply present. Conversely, the car will be responsive and everything other than AC and drive units will work when only 12V is present. You could be missing the entire HV battery pack and the car will happily tell you that, and let you listen to the music or whatever. Just like in any other car when you run out of gas. HV battery charge is like gasoline in Teslas. "
"They have to pinch every penny to make their margins, which is a recipe for problems. "
"have you forgotten the millions of cars recalled by multiple other companies in the last 10+ years?
"
This comment is way underrated. 
"Then, on the control panel, go up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-b-a. I hear that will unlock extra range."
"> petrol pedal

The same holds true with an ICE though. There are plenty of things that can go wrong and leave you on the side of the road requiring a tow. 
"Depending on the ICE car and the level of electronics in them, the same applies."
Just imagine... Wow!!

"Their cultural disdain for Toyota, Lean and the NUMMI legacy is biting them in the ass.

They kinda deserve it. They‚Äôre wrong, after all. We know how to do quality manufacturing these days, and they seem to have chosen to ignore that.

"Makes you wonder if the internal/employees first group had the same number of issues, and they were like a test group to look for any potential production problems. If so, they didn‚Äôt find enough or ignored them to get their production numbers up."
A ramp up in any complicated manufacturing process will always lead to more lemons.   But tesla could amend this by increasing Quality Assurance personnel and protocols.   
Or it could just be that there‚Äôs a much larger sample size to find the duds now...

"A few weeks ago I was lucky enough to be seated next to and had a lengthy conversation with a manufacturing automation exec for one of Tesla‚Äôs manufacturing partners who had just spent a week in Fremont helping tune part of the Model 3 line. I sat next to him on a flight from SFO to ATL and we chatted the whole flight. He was very impressed with the way Tesla approaches manufacturing versus everyone else. Though it‚Äôs completely different, his takeaway was that they will succeed *because* they don‚Äôt give up looking for ways to do things better. He admitted it was frustrating because of expected norms, but said they push tenaciously to a better method in the end. Is it unchecked hubris, or courage of conviction? Time will tell.

All of this reminds me of the Volvo forums when they switched from 850 to S/V70 in the late 90s. No owner access to anything in the ECU. Bricked cars. Only the service center can talk to the car with a software key issued via satellite link from Sweden through their VADIS system. People were saying the same  sorts of things then about Volvo for pushing the envelope. I had a first run 70 series Volvo and never had a problem.

Points being: New stuff will have new issues & the internet has a natural bias toward negative experiences."
Aren't failures like this reasonably common in normal cars? 
3 total failures in 3000 cars means 1000 failures in a million - thats a PPM (parts per million) of  1000. The industry standard is about 50-75 PPM.

3 is only what's been reported here.  What about the ones that are not visitors of reddit or sharing on the intarwebs?
"Might be worse since the employee cars, employees had a nda. But there was a post of a employee dead car at a supercharger in a rainy day."
"3 failures in manufacturing aint so bad, but allowing them to get out of the factory is the problem."
Tbh all those highly up-voted negative comments about Tesla seem a little bit odd to me.
"1994-89 Honda Accord was a non interference motor. Those were the days.  I used to rebuild the master cylinders, wheel cylinders, alternators and starters on Honda, Toyota and Nissans.  80's and early 90's it was fun to fix cars cheap.
"
I'll agree with the gas to diesel conversion.  It's almost like the Tesla millennial complaint blog. They have no idea what it's like to really get screwed by a car manufacturer.
"You do have a point. Though, it is also supply and demand.  As more cars get on the road and out of warranty, you may see more of a demand for aftermarket service. At the same time, without the combustion motor, liquid cooling and the benefit of regenerative braking...you lose probably 80% of your maintenance cost. Same story on the parts.  Most high end cars have a limited selection of aftermarket parts.  Because there is little demand.  Like the iPhone, eventually someone will hack the Tesla and customize it for themselves."
"Exactly this. We have courtyards with multiple garages opening onto them, and anyone parking in the courtyard curbside would block others from getting out."
"Yeah it's concerning. I'm seriously considering delaying the Tesla for 3 years and making do with a new Leaf instead, because at least that comes from a company who actually have experience making cars that work."
"In theory I should sell my Outback to afford my Model 3, but I may overlap them for a few months."
"April 1, 2016"
They didn't say.
When did you leave SA?
"

Haha, couldn't resist but think of Steven Seagal ;-p

 https://youtu.be/oVclsVDTi3w"
"Door handles used to be a problem, to be sure.  They're $1.18 to fix these days, and you can 3d print your own replacement if you're worried Tesla will take too long.


The early drive units seemed to be a big problem, though that was with noise and not failure.  I bet that's why they do the infinite mile warranty for 8 years in the first place!  I haven't had trouble with DUs on either of my model S for a couple years now though."
"We need data, not anecodtes, whether they be good or bad! a vinbot for mechanical problems."
"""My grandpa smoked a pack a day and lived to be 90""

Doesn't matter.  There are *plenty* of Model S maintenance nightmare stories to go around, which is wholly unacceptable given the cost of buying a Model S and the typical sales pitch that a Tesla is worth the added premium because ""it requires less maintenance than an ICE car."""
[removed]
"I'm increasingly of the opinion that any reservation holder considering a 3 as their only car (myself included), has enough evidence to wait it out until Tesla has demonstrably achieved a high enough reliability score i.e. with hard statistics, rather than ""look at this one happy owner who's never been to a service centre""."
"This is an old anecdote, so take it with a grain of salt:

1. Fremont uses (used?) a lot of temp labor. These tend to be people who don't give as much of a shit because they can be fired at any moment. It's not conducive to quality manufacturing, and as the labor market tightens up it's going to get harder and harder to find quality people willing to put up with temp contracts.

2. What companies like Toyota and Honda pioneered--and even GM and Ford *eventually* figured out--was that it's better to have a slow line, *even a stopped line*, if that means problems are addressed as early as possible in production (i.e. the Andon system). In contrast at Fremont you want to NEVER stop the line for any reason, and will get in trouble if you do. It leads to a ""just push it out the door"" mentality.

Again, old (2014?) anecdote so maybe things have changed. But if not, it's no surprise they aren't getting high quality out of the system. "
"They need very good tenacious engineers are serious about really getting to the bottom of issues and fixing them right, vs ""just enough to get by"". Those people are hard to fine, and too be fair there might be just to many issues that there is no time to fix them right."
They're mostly <25 year old kids being herded by a small handful of wildly overworked veterans poached out of Detroit. 
"I'm no expert here, but I feel like they focus more on recruiting out of Silicon Valley and temp factory workers instead of recruiting actual automotive professionals.  I don't think that they're able to poach any of the Big 3's best people.  It's a pretty lousy proposition:

*""Come and work for us out in the middle of the desert for less pay, more working hours, and under a micromanaging visionary that also builds rockets!""*"
"How much does the automation manufacturing field pay, if you don't mind me asking? I'm a software developer with a handful of years of experience, and automation is one of my hobbies and study areas (I build robot arms for fun). I'm usually more interested in the software aspect, as that's the part I can most often get my hands on, but a lot of that is older technology with lots of limitations."
"Eeehh, I sort of align with your point, but you're not providing much concrete evidence to support it. Your explanation is akin to ""I know some code, this shouldn't be hard to do"", but really Tesla is dealing with subtle differences, not unlike https://xkcd.com/1425/, where even ""simple"" changes can be quite complex. 

I think they're trying to get by and do things they way they believe they should be done. Perhaps there might be organizational issues at a rapidly growing company causing some problems, but I think for what they've accomplished for how long they've existed, they're not too far off track."
Soft tooling :)?
"Or it died with him inside, and now he's trapped! Quickly, Reddit, we have to save him! Someone get the crowbar!"
media frenzy is a two-edged sword and Tesla can't say they haven't seen upside from it. This is the cost.

So far I've only needed to do this to fix issues with the  streaming radio service not working and the soft reset has worked for that. "

"A good comparison, for those experienced with Android, would likely be reboot vs soft reboot."

"I believe they tried too hard to get this car out on the road, they should have spent more time testing and fixing most of the big bugs then released to the public , it would probably have resulted on a faster quality car being sold to customers.

The fact that most of these problems are electrical is beyond inexcusable this is what tesla does, this is there whole reason for being and they cannot get it right."
"Eh, it happens. How many of these failures are at fault if Tesla's manufacturing/installing vs supplies?

I bought a new Subaru WRX and it ended up in the shop week after week for nearly a month once winter hit. 12V battery failed and then relay after relay when the temps hit -35 C. The things that failed had nothing to do with Subaru's manufacturing process right?"
Companies launch new models from time to time and I don't recall any other manufacturer having this much issue.
Any good reads on this? Specifically what TSLA is doing different?
I kinda wish Elon Musk sold Tesla to Apple and went even crazier with SpaceX. More capital for both companies that way and I think Apple could add the quality control and supply chain management that Tesla seems to be missing. 
"Given that one of the conditions of employee orders was that they were advised to not publicly speak about them, we have no way to know what kinds of defects those vehicles saw.  It's entirely possible these types of issues occurred in those first few thousand vehicles - we don't know.

Even when we just consider the owner orders that are currently being filled, it *seems* like these types of issues (major enough to make the vehicle inoperable) have only popped up in the last two weeks.  It'll be interesting to see what the new month indicates, in that regard, since we should see another spike in volume coming up."
"Also as they fix bottlenecks the production techniques will change. Things that were done slowly are being done fast. Things that were done by hand are being done by machine. Many machines have probably been reprogrammed. Some will have been replaced. 

All this brings up opportunities for new types of problems to creep in."
"You're referring to soft-tooling.  They skipped that step, because they'd done modeling and simulations and indicated they believed they could expedite their time to market (which became important given demand) by going straight to final tooling.  

That is normally the step where minor adjustments are made and tooling adjusted before they prep for final production.  To be fair, while it is not common, it is definitely not unprecedented.  "
"From this car and the other 2, looks like they skipped testing the software, too."
... at the beginning?
">While it may come as no shock that luxury-car maker Mercedes-Benz came out atop the list of least-recalled brands, with an average 0.41 units recalled per vehicle sold, General Motors, with nearly 100 million vehicles recalled since 1985, actually placed third-best, with 0.65 cars and trucks recalled per unit sold.

I did a quick google search. Im not sure where you are getting your numbers but forbes seems to disagree"
What's your source on that? I have no doubt that Tesla has a higher failure rate simply because they are a new manufacturer but I'm curious how the comparison is made. 
"Exactly, the fault-rate is much higher."
That would make it even worse. Unreported failures male the number even higher.
Yeah I doubt most employee owned cars get problems posted publicly.  Probably a lot more problems especially earlier on.
Obviously it must be more as the biggest group of buyers are employees with NDAs.
It is bad i just showed you the numbers.

Agreed. I went from being excited about getting one soon to deciding to wait a few years and drive my current car into the ground to give them time to sort these things out. Fit and finish has been a problem with Tesla that seems like the Model 3's first gen is suffering from too

"Ding ding ding. Quality is a practice of management, not engineering. And it‚Äôs not likely culture changes in a few years, so this seems the likely explanation."
"I think a lot of it is silicon Valley ""didn't build it here"" syndrome, where they have to ""disrupt"" everything, rather than just make a competitive product. In the real world, this of course means that when well over a century of development has led us to invariably making door handles the same way on every single type of car, tesla wants to do their own stupid thing that breaks all the time, because ""disruption."" I suspect an awful lot of this bone-headedness spills over into manufacturing. And while they're great at attracting 20 something's, straight out of college, nobody in their right mind with any experience in the field would want to come work for them. So there's a lot of highly competent children running the show, trying to do everything their own way. Hence, shitty manufacturing. "
Things changed. Check out the ‚ÄúThis American Life‚Äù NUMMI‚Äù podcast. 
Maybe they had the engineers but lost them due to the high turnover rate and awful management.
"Seriously, why can't tesla attract real talent? For fucks sake, even hyundai has managed to grab Peter schreyer, who ways the lead designer for audi for *years*, Albert Biermann, who headed the bmw m division for the development of some of the finest cars they ever made, luc donkerwolke, who designed just about every Lamborghini you can think of *and* the bentley continental, and a whole bunch of other giants of the automotive industry. And tesla's just being run by know it all kids who don't know well enough to realize that just because you can do something doesn't mean it's a good idea. "
You think Fremont is in the middle of the desert?
"Software development does pay more. I started automation manufacturing when I was 17 making $12.50. Got raises really quick and was making $50/hr in a year or 2. I make $100/hr right now working about 20 hours a week for that and do freelance programming work on my own. I usually charge a set fee, but it works out to around $100/hr. I could definitely charge double or triple that, and people do charge that much too. I do like mechanical engineering more, which is why I still do automation manufacturing part time. It‚Äôs just pretty nice working for myself programming and setting my own schedule for that. If you‚Äôre just doing machining you can make $25-50 in the Bay Area. Once you start getting into designing CAD/CAM, that‚Äôs when you‚Äôll start making $50-100/hr. "
"No. It‚Äôs not ‚ÄúI know some code.‚Äù I am a computer scientist and I have been automating assembly lines for the last 12.5 years. I know what goes into these things. Which is why I said if they have any skilled engineer, they shouldn‚Äôt be having so many manufacturing issues. Unforeseen bottlenecks is understandable, but the lack of quality from ‚Äúskilled‚Äù engineers is not. It doesn‚Äôt matter that they are a newish comoany; they aren‚Äôt reinventing the wheel or manufacturing, even though they are trying to make it more streamlined. "

"Other manufacturers do have that problem.  It‚Äôs been a thing all my life to ‚Äúnever buy the first year of a new/majorly changed car model‚Äù.  This is no different.

what makes you think most car manufacturers dont have problems? maybe you hear about their recalls too often and have started to ignore them"
Or they have the same problems and no one writes about them when it is other car manufacturers - the level of scrutiny on Tesla at this point is unprecedented.  
"Utterly false.  It's just that nobody cares when other car manufacturers have issues because they are boring and its been that way for decades.  Co-worker bought a jeep and they had a problem in the casting of top of the engine in 10% of vehicles.  He was without his jeep for 3 weeks while they disassembled and reassembled his engine with a new header.  Were you flabbergasted when that happend... were you gobsmacked???  No because you probably didn't even hear about it because its BORING and nobody cares.  Tesla is sexy, and that's why you hear about it."
"If this thread is any indication and has truth behind the claims, Tesla skipped in depth testing in order to ramp up production and get cars out sooner. Shame, really."
"The car is now in beta testing. The first several thousand cars off the line are intentionally sold to employees and current owners. Also, preference was given to people who live on the west coast of the USA where Tesla can respond more quickly and easily. OP states that he lives a short distance from the factory in Fremont. These are the hallmarks of a staged release intended to catch bugs that manifest themselves in real world conditions."
Oh wait....

Essentially leaves the power supply on and motherboard ‚Äúreboots.‚Äù Pretty much an instant reboot with no delay.
"My understanding is it grounds out the reset pin on the motherboard, which in turn re-initializes certain registers that causes it to resume execution at step 1 (pulling the BIOS into memory and boot strapping the OS)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_reset

The processor and motherboard never lose power. For some more advanced devices it's possible for reset to get your system back up without ever shutting down, clearing memory, it just kicks execution back to some pre-known state."

It‚Äôs an assumption based on the results and stories from the inside, but it seems like Tesla is stuck on the American way of management, and thus will have a much more difficult path to quality production.

Cars are super complex and lots of parts/systems have to work really well, but luckily a bunch of semi-smart Americans, Germans and Japanese have spent decades solving most of those problems.  You just need to reverse engineer a few good examples, hire some experienced people and do it the ""standard"" way.

""Gotta disrupt"" and ""any old approach must suck"" might be fine for a phone game, but stuff like cars and airplanes are a terrible fit for that mentality."
"While your thought is valid, the real world is not like that. 

There are tons of experienced auto workers at the factory. In 2010 NUMMI was producing 6,000 vehicles a week there. Also in 2010 NUMMI shut down and TESLA announced plans. Initial hire from NUMMI was only 70 key people to help and advise with the change over. But many NUMMI workers were hired by TESLA as the plant grew. Experienced people want to work for TESLA.

There is nothing special or disruptive about the assembly line, those terms belong to the car itself. If anything TESLA is a little behind but following closely the best practices of other manufacturers.

That explains those numbers. 12.5 is low to start, but $50/hour within a few years is astounding. My ideal job would be a lot like you describe (but with software development instead of machining), but I'd prefer a 40-hour workweek and instead take lot of time off to travel. 

So what kind of programming work do you do? Is it entirely robotics, or do you do one of the C#/Java/Python/etc stacks. In the Midwest, so many companies just don't have the ability or desire to take advantage of a decent skill stack."
"Thing is, they didn't re-invent the wheel but they did try to re-invent door handles and it hasn't gone over well, ha. An EV has the potential to be painfully simple with only a handful of moving parts, but they chose to go head first into the wow-factor and sacrifice quality."
Since you have experience you know there are always surprises no matter how skillful you are. My classic example was at Caterpillar when they found out someone had replaced a roll up door and the engines could not leave the factory.
"> Or they have the same problems and no one writes about them when it is other car manufacturers - the level of scrutiny on Tesla at this point is unprecedented. 

When Germany manufacturers have a faulty car, it gets send to a special line where it will be checked if the car can be fixed. If not, the car will be disassembled and the parts will be used as spare parts. But this costs time and money, both of which Tesla can not afford.

"It's their polite way of making sure you reboot again without using the word ""again.""  They know it's not different, but the second reboot verifies you have indeed rebooted and helps check logs between the two reboots if they're chasing a problem they don't see.

"But we aren‚Äôt talking software. This thread is about hardware. With Tim Cook being a supply chain guy, Apple in particular excels at this. It‚Äôs a reason Jobs chose Cook, he knew that he‚Äôd be able to efficiently run the product side.

Software is a totally different thing that has its own issues at Apple. See the power struggle between Scott Forstall and Jony Ive (hardware product designer). Scott was essentially let go because was uncompromising about his software design aesthetics (skeuomorphic centric) whereas Ive focuses on industrial minimalism. Ive was given Forstall‚Äôs position to unify hardware and design but Ive‚Äôs design motifs feel almost cold due to the industrial minimalism and is definitely generic. This all happened in the immediate post-Jobs years at Apple. It seems to me that Apple‚Äôs software problem really stem from the trying to fit a square peg (industrial minimalism) in a round hole (user experience). 

In my personal opinion, Ive‚Äôs designs work for hardware luxury products but that doesn‚Äôt make for a compelling user experience when you interact with the software."

"Well, that and a huge chunk of automotive components are purchased from suppliers.  You can buy motors, transmissions and pretty much any other part from suppliers, Aisin and Denso are examples, but there are many.  The major auto manufacturers are system integrators (and most design/manufacture their own engines), but most parts are bought.  This is another thing Tesla does different, and perhaps is part of why they struggle in the quality department."

I do a lot of app development around here, so thats mostly java, swift, and other c type languages. For the automation, we mainly just use Siemens PLC's, so thats mostly just normal yes or no PLC programming. It can definitely get more involved depending on the project though."

True story: About 12 years ago, I was driving my old Jeep Grand Cherokee.  This idiot was driving like a complete idiot, cutting people off, randomly changing lanes, etc.  He cut in front of me.  I hit the horn.  At the next intersection, he stopped way short and got out of his can with a tire wrench, screaming at me.  I hit the gas, full throttle, straight at him as fast as my 195 HP straight 6 could do.  He jumped out of the way.

underrated comment. unlike most manufacturers that release a vehicle with problems that more than likely dont get fixed in the next iteration (or cant) the beauty behind teslas are that because everything is so interconnected and computer controlled regulating problems even down to voltages and stuff can be fixed via updates. i used to hate electronics in cars (am ex mechanic) but i really think tesla nailed it with their system.

Apple has a great SCM, but they aren't a manufacturing company. They don't operate their own factories. That is all outsourced to Foxconn. Tesla, Toyota, BMW, etc all operate their own manufacturing plants unlike Apple, so saying that they are good at manufacturing is not true. "

"Software updates are almost always going to be covered under the manufacturer warranty. And a situation like this is requiring the car to be towed in no matter what.

And let's not forget about the non-zero likelihood of an OTA update actually causing a situation like this. I personally don't want my car randomly receiving and applying updates without my per-update consent prior to applying an update.

For those of us that don't happen to live close to a Tesla Service Center look at a situation like OP's with abject horror.  If I have a bricked BMW 3 Series, I can have my car taken to the local dealer and have it fixed. I can go check on it easily. With Tesla, my car would be towed  three hours away. In both situations, I'll have a loaner vehicle of the same make as my own car.

Don't take any of this to mean I'm not rooting for Tesla. Even if I never buy a Tesla, the pressure Tesla is putting on incumbents means I will be able to buy an EV much sooner than otherwise could have happened. And Tesla the clean energy/energy storage/DC charging network company is making the world a better place for EVs no matter what happens with their vehicle business."
"A lot of people have been told that, it's one of those urban legends that keeps making the rounds.  It's a non destructive myth though, so no harm in repeating it.

If that longer wait is a ""deeper reboot"" the brake pedal should trigger the longer wait time as well.

"But is that a feature you can pay to unlock or upgrade to? Don‚Äôt all iPhones still come with wired headphones and an adapter that lets you use any 3.5mm headphones? Not sure that wireless Bluetooth headphones is a pay-to-upgrade type of situation. There‚Äôs the convenience on older models of being able to charge and use wired headphones at the same time, but outside of that, how is this a feature you have to pay to use/unlock?"
Cause most people don‚Äôt have Bluetooth headphones. You are probably the guy you bemoaned the fact that cassette players were removed from cars
"Don‚Äôt the face tracking emojis use the dot projector which is used for Face ID? How would you suggest someone use the tech on, say, an iPhone 7? Or do users have to pay to unlock these emojis?"
"Perhaps I missed it, but I didn't see anything that suggests this issue was caused by an update. Seems like a hardware failure of some kind.

The most unusual software issue I had was on the day of delivery. Bluetooth and wifi weren't working, so I rebooted the center screen and then it wouldn't get past the boot screen. Car was still drivable, just couldn't access most of the features. Spent a couple hours on the phone with Owner Support around midnight, mostly going through troubleshooting steps, and they fixed it remotely.

Tesla doesn't automatically apply updates without your consent, except when done by a service technician, so that's a non-issue. The point is that you can ignore updates and have service handle them if you want, while with service performed by dealers, you have no choice but to take it in for software updates, which I think in some ways discourages the manufacturer from sending out frequent updates.

The closest service center to me is about 4 hours away. When I called for annual service or warranty repairs, they came and picked up my car within a few days or as soon as the next morning, leaving me with a loaner Model S better than mine. In one case, they just performed repairs in the parking lot at my work. I've never had my car bricked, but I'm confident if I did, they would prioritize me for same-day pickup/repair, or first thing in the morning. My last ranger lived just a few miles away in a neighboring town and swapped my car first thing in the morning for annual service; that's how Tesla makes service fast and convenient when there isn't a nearby service center. In my case, Tesla is banned from opening a service center in my state, so that's the best they can do."
"Why would the folks in Fremont perpetuate this ""urban legend""?"
"They use the front camera only. I believe MKBHD did a test where he covered the dot projector and they still worked.

Man, I'm the President of local chapter of the  car club for the brand of car I drive, but if I had a situation like this on the day I took delivery of one of their cars, I'd be reaming both the dealer and corporate. That is a completely unacceptable customer experience.

My wife wants a Tesla, but I don't know how long she'd put up with stuff like this.

Also, I drive a plug-in hybrid that is a first model year car. I've put 7k miles on it in five months without a single issue. Hopefully Tesla can get both their initial and long term quality up to match their competition, and quickly."

If you'd have bought an actual car you wouldn't have had that problem in the first place. And you should've refused acceptance of that car anyway. That's not your problem to fix.

"""I don't believe you"" or ""reboot again so I can see if the boot logs give me a clue"" are less professional.  Also, the helpdesk knows as much about your car as you do; developers don't answer the phone and the people that do hear the same urban legends you do.  In-store staff are wrong about the car all of the time, putting that same knowledge level on the phone won't make them more educated.

Like I said, it's non-destructive to believe the myth, if you choose to believe it just do that - there's no need to push back.  I'm OK with people believing in santa, but I will mention it's a common myth when I hear it repeated so others can make an educated choice on the matter.

If you find yourself dwelling on the matter, grab a stopwatch and go to the garage.  Root your car if that isn't enough."
They do indeed use the IR and depth sensors. He seems to have updated his claim after speaking with Apple. There are a number of sources that corroborate this. See MKBHD‚Äôs tweet: https://twitter.com/mkbhd/status/930871607094140928
"I consider that to be a side effect of being an early adopter. I got my car less than two years after launch of Model S. For the privilege of owning a decent EV, I have been willing to take that chance and tolerate some reliability issues. Fortunately, it has been working relatively great ever since that initial issue. I wouldn't be surprised if my car has been serviced less frequently on average than most modern ICE cars, even though half of my services were for warranty issues that Tesla insisted on fixing right away instead of waiting until the annual as I was willing to do (except for one with a broken window regulator)."
"I didn't even notice the issue until after I accepted it and tried connecting my phone. There were no Tesla personnel at delivery to work with me through any issues, just the third-party truck driver. Anyway, I was excited, it drove without issue, and the glitch was resolved in a timely manner. I'm not a whiny perfectionist when it comes to cars, that's how you inconvenience yourself waiting another 2-3 months for a replacement which could also not be perfect. I'm nearly 4 years in and loving it at least as much as the day I took delivery.

The only thing I really wanted for service was not having to drive all the way to the service center and ideally not being stuck with a gas loaner. I would have no problem getting an EV loaner worse than mine as long as it had the range for my commute. Most of what makes owning one so great is just bonus and not a deciding factor for me. I likely would have gone for another brand of EV if any existed with at least 100 miles EPA at the time."
Despite the time of the reboot being the same I can't imagine the exact same process happens when you have your foot on the brake or don't have your foot on the brake. One method you can do while driving and the other you can't.

"I thought you were just trying to convince *me* that a ""deeper reboot"" is indicative of longer reboot time?

The reboot is the same, regardless, but owners don't need to know or care.  Believing otherwise will never affect you in any way, aside from remembering this conversation if you need to call the helpdesk.  They're using the two reboots to have a nice easy ctrl-f search string to snip from when they send along to level 2 support, and you think the reboot does something different without questioning to yourself why they'd do an ineffective not-as-reboot first when the ""better reboot"" that takes the exact same amount of time wasn't just done first if that was expected to fix something.  It's just something people don't think about so they make up stories."
"As far as I'm aware, we currently have a sample of one with a bricking issue out of thousands delivered. Not enough to determine overall reliability. Still, day 1 reservation holders should know they are taking a chance with reliability, being so early in the production queue for a first-of-its-kind car from a relatively new manufacturer. I have confidence Tesla will do all they can to prevent major issues such as this, as they have shown with Model S and X. They're constantly under a microscope and they certainly hate the negative publicity they get for every significant reliability issue or especially safety issue. Often, all it takes is one occurrence that they can examine and they'll figure out what caused it and how to fix or at least prevent it. I expect they would easily have average or better reliability by the time they reach 100,000 units. Of course, like any other car, there is always a non-zero chance of a lemon that gets through QA and starts acting up as soon as it's driven off the lot."
"Oh, definitely lemons happen with any manufacturer.

I'm rooting for Tesla, but I do wonder if Tesla won't end up dropping their vehicle business at some point to focus on solar, batteries, and charging network. 

I'm really hoping to see them sell Supercharger access to other manufacturers. Or maybe get in to the business of selling Supercharger installations as a white label for other manufacturers or to, for example, truck stops. There massive amounts of money to made in the coming decades building out checking infrastructure even if they never are able to get a handle on mass market auto manufacturing (even though I want them to succeed at that, too).

Cheers!"
"> I'm rooting for Tesla, but I do wonder if Tesla won't end up dropping their vehicle business at some point to focus on solar, batteries, and charging network.

You make a good point. Tesla's mission is ""to accelerate the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy"". If they complete that mission in the vehicle industry such that 100% of new vehicles from all manufacturers are EVs, it's not that far-fetched of an idea that they would discontinue their vehicle business. I suspect if they do, they would most likely sell it or branch it off into a separate company with a different mission statement. I would, of course, hope for the latter if Tesla is still the driving force of innovation at that point or if the dealers still have a stranglehold on whatever manufacturer may buy them."
