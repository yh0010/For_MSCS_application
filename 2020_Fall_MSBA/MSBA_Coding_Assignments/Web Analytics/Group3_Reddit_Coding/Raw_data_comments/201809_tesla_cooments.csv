"Because there is some misinformation here, this should clear up some things.

- Tesla previously offered battery packs that were software-limited larger packs, so you could get into a cheaper Tesla with less range, but had the same performance specs.
- Free Supercharging is for select Model S, Model X and Performance Model 3's with an owners referral at purchase.  Non-Performance Model 3's are pay-per-use Supercharging.
- Supercharging fills up your battery approx 170 miles in 30 min and is intended for long-distance travel.  Learn more [here](https://tesla.com/charging) and [here](https://tesla.com/trips).
- This update (what this post is referring to) enables free supercharging for all cars in the hurricane’s path, along with temporary pack software upgrades."
Now if only they'd allow me to hook up an inverter to my car in case I need emergency power!
"That's really cool.

Meanwhile, Verizon throttles data for SC and suggests everyone upgrade.  /s"
"Can someone please explain; how can Tesla remotely, digitally, increase the car’s battery capacity? I don’t get it."
The free supper charging for all is super nice of them.  Also I wished they had a storm response team for the network like other major industries like the gas companies do.  We need the charger network to be up and safe ASAP pre and post storm for all those in the evacuation order area.  
How can they allow your car to have more battery capacity? Is it being restricted initially?
"Wait, what?  Software locked battery capacity?

Why would they sell the car with extra battery cells?"
Additional battery capacity for everyone or only those software locked models?
Pretty awesome!
"I'm in awe, great job Tesla!"
"What other car company would do that?

There is not an ICE car company that can increase the size of their fuel tank automatically, remotely and for free.  And neither would say, here, fill up for free.

Let alone a car company that would help their customers in a potential disaster evacuation to begin with.

But Tesla does, why is this not reported as vigorously as they do other stuff.

This is how a company should act towards customers."
Gracious gesture. 
"I think it's a bit creepy that you buy a car, but the company you bought it from, can still tinker with it, remotely. It's like you bought it, but you're only renting it."

"Does the fact that a company having complete access to your car and the opportunity to shut it off at any moment freak anyone else out? That's so fucked, that's a level of intrusion I never want to experience. "
"Almost clicked OK to accept the message. 
I don't own Tesla car. "
having a corporation fuck with my car remotely sounds like a nightmare
Greatest car company in the world
wait so normally supercharging isn't free?
"So does each tesla actually have the same capacity battery, but the lower models just don't get to use the whole thing? Does that mean you could purchase a higher capacity without actually physically upgrading the battery? "
Tesla really should just make this standard policy indefinitely.
"Brilliant and the right thing to do Gas prices go up, supercharging becomes free. Who is on your side in a time of need? Place your bets. "
Ya....but HE SMOKED WEED
Hooray! All the rich people are saved!
But elon smoked weed tho. How am I supposed to support someone who gives people in need free shit to help them if they did something perfectly legal that most people will have done at least once in their lives?
"How can they increase your battery capacity or enable ""supercharging"" in your vehicle? Unless your Tesla already had those abilities but they were preventing you from using them."
"So why do you normally have to pay for this feature if you bought the car and the battery installed in it? It's cool that they're making it free for a day, but I don't want my car of all things to have day 1 DLC on disk."

"The most expensive model (p100d) costs between 95,000 and 135,000 dollars depending on options. Everything else is below that. Even if we take 100,000 dollars, which is not indicative of the average price of a Tesla, what GM EV is better than a tesla for $20,000?  

As far as I'm aware, the only GM EV is the bolt, which has an MSRP of $38,000. If that's the one you're going with, how do you define that it is better than the P100D ($100,000 model). What categories does it beat a p100d?  

If you are thinking of a different GM EV, which one?"
Meanwhile what they *really* need are those submarines he made for the Thailand cave rescue.
Any free gas? Yea I didn't think so. Fuck the oil companies. 
Someone please tell me why don't they give you full battery capacity to begin with?
"Nice P.R., but does the price of charging matter in reality? Poor people don’t drive Teslas..."
"I’ve not truly looked at Tesla’s as a legitimate purchase, but if they keep up this kind of service and assistance then I will definitely make it a purchase at some point in my life. 

This is awesome."
Good PR move.
Yet one more reason to own a Tesla and run the shorts off
What does additional battery capacity even mean? 
"as a noobie regarding Tesla - what is supercharging and why does something need to be ""enabled""? 

Don't you buy the car and have access to everything? "
This is the most useful thing I've seen all-day
I bet that a whole bunch of people spend the extra to upgrade in mid-october after experiencing these upgrades.
"The enabling of supercharging is in the older Model S60, which originally had supercharging as an option.  "
People complaining about this when gas cars have been doing it for years. 
[removed]
How much is does it cost to charge your car at a charger?
He turned them up to 11.
"If that is the case they still would be doing it which they don't.    Currently you can get 2 battery sizes in the model s an X.  They are 75 and 100 kWhs.   Both of them are physically different batteries and the 75 kWh is not a software locked version of the 100.   They only did this for a short period of time because of the number of battery versions they had.   At one point there was a 60, 70, 75.   So they just made one 75 kWh pack and software locked to the two other sizes.   "
I love it when companies do awesome stuff for publicity. Tesla has done some amazing charitable work all over the world in the last two years.

"Hi all,

Is there any reason to limiting the battery's capacity in the first place?"
Wish I could be in the USA
Can someone please list which gas stations in the hurricane's path will be giving out free gasoline? Gotta stock up for my yard equipment.
Why do they throttle the batteries in the car? 
aw those poor poor boomers :((((
So reading the sticky and my fairly limited understanding of manufacturers limitations. Could you theoretically jailbreak a Tesla to unlock some of the goodies the manufacture doesn’t allow on some models?
"Out of curiosity, how hard is it to modify the software yourself? Like I know if you want to change the code on a normal car you have to just tune the ecm and you need a code but you can go through a regular tunning shop. "

Wait just last week someone told me superchargers are free to use already when you buy a Tesla... 
Let’s see how much coverage this gets in the media...
Why is this so loved that you have the capabilities but they lock it on you. 
">Badging on your display may adjust during this period.

What is that supposed to mean?"
"Fuck yeah!!! Tesla. Cant afford one. But fuck yeah anyways. 
As a contractor I tell my customers to buy one. And I dont even own one. Company seems awesome. "
Question. How long does it take for a full charge?
"So I guessing this is a firmware update.
I've only seen a handful of Tesla's.
What's to stop people from stopping their car getting downgraded afterward?"
Fuck I want a Tesla so bad
Another American company doing good during natural disasters. 
"With electric cars something like this is possible. I doubt any gas station would offer free fuel to anyone in a hurricanes path, but with electric cars, that Tesla has control over the charging stations, this is very doable. Really good move by tesla!"
But wait!  There's More!
If course mainstream media doesn't announce this.
I wonder if they could send me some ram.
I had this same thing last year hurricane Irma 
They should enable Autopilot for everyone near the coast too... makes that traffic a little more bearable.
"👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 I don’t see any other car companies offering free gas or anything, so good on you Tesla!!!"
Is super charging not free?
"So it's about four months later now and this ""temporary"" unlocking of battery capacity still hasn't been rescinded. I would have thought they'd have relocked the battery by now."
when there's a big story about Tesla being anti-union.  interesting timing.
WOW !Tesla just dropped the mic on every car manufacturer on the planet. PEOPLE FIRST PROFITS EVENUALLY😍😍😍
All 5 people should be ok. 
"wait, extra battery capacity? why isnt the battery's full capacity always ""enabled""? wtf kind of bullshit is that?"
"So Tesla cars have batteries that you can't use at max capacity, unless you pay more?
And the charging speed is slow, unless you pay even more?
So cars have DLC now. Great times. "
I thought charging your car was always free?
r/humansbeingbros
I've been thinking it was free all along
"But..but...the CEO was seen smoking weed... That means that the company can no longer do any good!   
/s "
"LOL

So, what, the 1000 people in the state who own Teslas are ok?

Damn Reddit, don't hurt yourself patting Elon on the back so hard"
"Wait, I thought supercharging was already free for life?"
I love this company!!  
"This backfired on them the last time they unlocked car features. Great idea and people should be grateful for the help but others got a bit angry about TSLA being able to control someone's car remotely.

"High impact marketing strategy.

"""Your software is updating, this may take a while....."" "
"Some info about battery capacity:

Electric car manufacturers artificially limit their cars' battery capacities (yes, even the top of the line model) for two practical, pro-consumer reasons. First, charging or discharging a battery all the way wears it out far more than staying in the middle 70% or so. Second, as a battery wears out, more capacity is gradually unlocked so that it can retain it's original ""practical capacity"" for a far longer time."
Don't see GM offering free fuel to any of their customers... 
"This sounds like a game achievement: Congratulations, you have unlocked better charge"
"Seriously, this is awesome. Imagine GM or Ford offering free gas fill-ups?!?"
"Wait, so the battery capacity is capped based on what you pay?"
"""You may temporarily access all of the car you own! Be grateful!""

Reversible binning is anticompetitive behavior and should be illegal. "
"Joe rogan literally just talked about this happening to someone else's car company on the podcast....all the cars got soaked abd battery's blew up. It was ""funny"". Elon played it cool of course and said ""that's why we made ours waterproof"" and hit the blunt,of course. Kind of crazy..."
I thought supercharging was already free?
But their CEO smoked weed! 
"Unless the hurricane tries to unionize, then they'll shut down all their chargers and rebuild them elsewhere."

Thats terrifying. Way too much control and power of your vehicle.
It should be free in the first place. I personally think so any way. Charging you for a download.
"Not surprised (there is precedent for this), but it is totally cool of them.    

Go Tesla Go!"
"OH GOODIE God Elon is letting me use my 100 thousand dollar car to its full potential.

But just for a bit guys......."
They sell you dlc that's already in the car. Fuck them
"Holy crap, who on earth wants to buy a car that's completely gimped without DLC?"
"How do they remotely control the battery capacity,"
[deleted]
I supercharge for free everyday? I didn’t know some places charged money 
ELI5. Can you not always charge for free?
"Meanwhile, gas prices shoot up."
I have a question: why are these features locked to begin with if the hardware is already there to support them?
"This just touches on the whole issue of right to repair and the idea that you don't own your car, you are renting it/leasing it (at least the OS) from Tesla, who is free to do as they please. They are benevolent now, but I'd rather have the choice to use my whole battery or throttle it. "
wait tf that actually costs money after you bought an expensive ass car
How does that help if the power is out?
Why does Tesla throttle a battery’s charge capacity? How can they lock/unlock that?
Quick now block Tesla auth servers in the firewall and enjoy free battery for life.  
"I know the battery life issues of draining your full battery, but why exactly does Tesla think its okay to have full control of the battery life ""emergency mode"" instead of giving consumers the option of flipping a switch themselves? There are plenty of personal emergencies that would warrant using it without a mass scale shut on. Its a very apple-esque philosophy- ""we know whats better for you with our products"". Not to mention the implications of having a completely external force be able to manage how much of a battery you are willing to use.

I know this is exactly the wrong sub to post this stuff in, but this to me is one reason, among others, to not buy a Tesla. They did a great thing for the market by forcing conventional car companies to go mainstream, but as a personal buying decision, I will not buy one if this ""feature"" is still a thing.

Point is moot cuz I'm broke anyways but..."
"I have a legal question: 

Given that Tesla has demonstrated the ability to enable/disable additional battery capacity at the flick of a switch, does that open them up to potential lawsuit? If I'm in an emergency, shouldn't I be able to do the same? We don't make people pay for cell phone service before they can dial 911.


"
So it’s more expensive than a car?
[deleted]
Hurricanes definitely a peado too
"Remember folks, being in the good graces of the public is just as much an asset as anything else. "
“Yea but their CEO smokes weed so I’m boycotting Tesla”
Why dont they allow them to have access to more battery capacity all the time?
Soooooo they throttle battery capacity any other time.....
Um...why was there an artificial limiter on it in the first place?
"Wait, Tesla throttles the charging speed of its cars? Do you have to normally pay more to unlock this? "
"Why is nobody asking why they are selling cars with artificially limited battery capacity in the first place? 

Sorry you are stuck on the side of the road. We can allow you access to the 20% reserve for an additional one time payment of $1,999. 

What toxic bullshit. "
Why digitally limit the battery charge?
What is supercharging? like faster charging or more maximum capacity? And if this is possible why isn't it standard?
Additional battery capacity?? Do they lock part of your battery unless you pay extra? How does it work? 
Why dont they enable supercharging and expanded capacity in a normal config? Is it a beta thing? Wouldn't that be dangerous if the supercharging is too new?
Um why would you normally not be able to access your capacity?
[deleted]
"Good, I was really worried about the safety of Tesla owners"
based elon.
"Why don't they sell the vehicle with more battery capacity if they can automatically do that with a software update?

Edit: Just saw the mod sticky"
Uncontrolled aftermarket access for throttled equipment... During another hurricane. Highly unethical regardless of the intent. Will the defense still be the same if they throttel car performance before the next model release? 
"Wow, even cars have loot boxes now."
WTF... Batteries have DRM now?
"This is disturbing that they know that your car is near the hurricane's path. Big brother Tesla much?

&#x200B;"
Microtransactions in cars. You guys are being robbed in broad daylight. Hilarious.
I don’t have a Tesla. Why would they restrict that “additional battery capacity” to begin with?
Can anyone explain why this isn't always available? Would it ruin the battery or something?
Thanks for unlocking a feature that is already built into the car but you don't let people use?
The rich are _always_ getting richer.
Is there a reason supercharging is a paid service? Lol
... the supercharging is a bit counterintuitive... its just going to burn up battery that much quicker... 
"Man through fanboys are strong here, musk can do no wrong"
"Lmao. A quick charge. Who wants to spend 4 hours at a gas station let alone 30 min.

Good luck building Tesla gas stations "
"Let's incetivize people to get into the hurricane's path, what a great idea! /s

&#x200B;

But honestly some people are going to use this the wrong way."
"And when you get in an accident and are injured or killed due to increased power provided and the implication that it was given by Tesla to allow you to drive faster than safety would allow, you'll see people or insurance companies filing lawsuits against them."
Just to add to this.   Current batteries from Tesla are not software locked.  The Model S and X are either 75 or 100 kWhs and they are physically different batteries.   The software limited batteries were only for a fairly short period of time and were mostly 75 kWh batteries that were software limited to 60 or 70 kWhs.
"Wait so they limited what the car is capable of and made it cheaper, but it's still exactly the same? 

As if Ferrari knocked 10k off a car and said ""you can't go over 100mph""?"
One other point: Some early Model S vehicles don't have access to pay-as-you-go Supercharging so if they didn't pay the $2500 to get unlimited supercharging they aren't actually able to access the network at all. This should also allow those early owners to Supercharge if necessary.
"Any word on how they're determining which cars are in the path? Owner address, geolocation?"

So this is basically DLC. Are we sure Tesla isn't owned by EA?
"Not possible, that pot head Elon Musk would never try to help people. Must be a publicity stunt like the cave rescue thing in Thailand. This is just liberal propaganda "
[deleted]
"This is supposedly going to be a thing on the pickup truck, and I hope an option for all teslas now that free supercharging is going away.  Even my old ""small"" battery can power a house for several days straight without taking any energy savings measures so that would be pretty awesome in evacuation scenarios."
Wouldn’t that be lovely
"Seriously. I have a battery-backup sump pump, but depending on load, it could run out in a day. It operates at 1kw for a few seconds every few minutes (in a heavy flow storm) and I've got this beautiful 75kwh battery within twenty feet."
"[CHAdeMO adapter](https://shop.tesla.com/ca/en/product/vehicle-accessories/model-s_x-chademo-adapter.html) and a V2H (vehicle to home) system like [Mitsubishi’s 1,5 kW system](https://i.imgur.com/ArkhoOs.jpg) or [Nissan’s 6 kW system.](https://i.imgur.com/Sr8QCF9.jpg)


If Tesla’s CHAdeMO implementation is standards compliant I imagine that it could use the systems above. They work on the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, Nissan Leaf, Kia Soul EV, and the Toyota Mirai fuel-cell among others. 

"
You can then plug your car back into the inverter and never have to charge your car again!
It has an inverter in it. Almost any frequency and any voltage can be made by the motor inverter. It just needs to be made available. 
"Can't you already do that with the 12 volt system?
"
"They can't take the wear of such a conversion into account, and therefore cannot bring warranty to market on a third party chop-n-change style upgrade.

But you CAN plumb in an invertor, attach a secondary ICE, convert your car into a shooting rake... Anything you like. Just don't ask Daddy Elon to fix your shit up if it breaks down.

They might do something fucky with remote shutdowns or some other DRM style bullshit, so if they're bricking customised cars then disregard my above point."
">  

A battery pack that you can store in your trunk of your car. The modifications of adding battery pack can take up space, but there are plenty of case modders who build sound systems that can easily modify your car to conceal a extra battery pack that you connect your car to with if you plan on traveling long distances. If you don't use much storage (single/family unit models, etc), you can easily add such a device and install it in your trunk permanently with a sleek concealment compartment.

Something similar could maybe come to fruition for hybrid cars with other companies perhaps?

"
"the original tesla roadster can be upgraded to this capability
https://shop.quickchargepower.com/JdeMo-for-Tesla-Roadster-JdeMORoadster.htm

then you need a CHAdeMO v2g or v2h
altogether that works out to like $8k usd

then you need the $30k battery upgrade from tesla to make it worthwhile

so total inc installation is about $40k usd
but you cannot use superchargers"
You can hook an inverter up to your 12V battery and your big battery will keep it topped off. You just have to use some tools to gain access.
Ok but at least they don’t do it during wildfires or anything
You may be removing that /s here in the next week. 
Switch to t-mobile bruh
"Well, technically since the battery is being ""enabled"" for greater capacity, doesn't that mean Tesla throttles people 99% of the time and stops them from using the product to the fullest potential until they deem it necessary?"
Tesla is doing this out of self interest. The last thing they want is a Tesla stranding someone fleeing a hurricane making the news. 
"No need for the /s, that’s exactly what they did to the fire fighters in California during a wild fire while they were on site trying to stop it. "

"Well, Tesla does still throttle your battery capacity the other non-hurricane days of the year. So there's that."
what? For Harvey last year Verizon gave everyone in Houston unlimited data for months
But Tesla throttles their batteries every day and no one complains.

75kwh packs are just digitally restricted 80kwh packs for example but for regular ones I think with this they let the computer tap into the restricted reserve for battery longevity
This guy has never downloaded more RAM. 
"As well as restricting the maximum amount you can fill the battery to help degradation, some cars have larger battery packs than they paid for, ie 100kw in a 80kw car as that's what was available at the time for whatever reason. "
"The cars when new are prevented from charging above a certain % of the actual physical battery capacity to slow degradation, the system will automatically adjust this as the batteries get older so that you keep the same range you started with for a longer time."
"It’s limited by a computer. Reason being a lithium battery like your phone can only be charged so many times. So it’s true capacity is 100% (obviously) but is limited to only charge and die at 40-60% or 20-80%... Why? Because if you discharged and charged FULLY it causes extra stress on the battery. We buy new phones all the time so there is no reason to limit us because it’s disposable. It would be a shame if a 50,000-100,000 dollar car would only last 3 years which is why they limited it. However in an emergency the risk of battery wear and tear is irrelevant so they lifted the limit in the software. 
 
Short version: If a lithium battery is outside the 20-80% range it takes extra wear and tear and reduces the number of total charge cycles. Hence why phone batteries go bad quickly and the Tesla battery is meant to last such a long time."

>Only on a couple of models. The first Model S had three versions: 40, 60, 85. Only the 60 and 85 sold in meaningful numbers, so they were the only batteries made. It would have actually cost quite a bit more to start building ""40"" batteries when so few were ordered. The 40 car got a 60 battery that was capped at 40 kWh. and the car was still sold for the ""40"" price. This opened up two interesting possibilities: paid upgrade to 60 just for paying the price difference at any time you wanted, and much reduced battery wear, so a 40 battery will likely never start to wear out much.

> A few years later, Tesla revisited that strategy with the new ""60"" Model S and X cars in 2016. At this point, Tesla made 75, 90, and 100 (toward the end of this) battery units. This 60 option was introduced as a way to offer a cheaper price of entry for the Model S, basically allowing you to decrease the price of the car, only to pay the difference plus a small fee to unlock the extra capacity later if you wanted it. It's important to understand that Tesla actually made a lot less money on these cars. Later, Tesla offered the upgrade for substantial savings, sometimes as little as a couple thousand dollars."
"It's like downloading more ram, but more lithiumy."
"It's a paywalled gas tank: you only can fill your tank to a certain percentage and if you want to have your tank fuller than that, pay up."
"I know everyone has already answered your question, but what’s scary to me about this kind of trend is that people seem to be ok with it.  Personally, I think the idea of an artificially limited battery is a huge step in the wrong direction for consumers.  It doesn’t take much of an imagination to see the potential for abuse of this type of tactic.  Maybe not tomorrow, but some years down the road."
"Lithium batteries have a certain ""safe operation"" range. When you charge a lithium battery to ""100%"" it's not actually at the max physical capacity and neither is it completly discharged when the batter is at ""0%"". This is because having the battery at Max physical charge or completely discharged is stressful to the battery and will damage it and decrease it's lifespan over time. So batteries limit how discharged they can get and how much charged they can get. What they are doing here I presume, is that they are getting rid of the ""software safety lock"" for the battery, so it can charge and discharge completly. It will damage the battery and cause stress to it, but it's much better for people to be alive and for a Tesla to survive than to prevent damage to a battery"
"because the batteries have the capacity. but they didn't pay for it... 

it'd be like your internet giving you max speed even though you only pay for 5 down because there's an emergency. "
"Battery health seriously degrades if charged too much and unloaded too much. Batteries show basically no degradation if only used in a very narrow band, say charging to 80% and unloading to 60% (I do not know the exact values). If they remotely increase battery capacity, they're changing the charging and unloading restrictions, basically sacrificing battery health for extra capacity."
"Yes, this.  Tesla needs a emergency response team with like 5 semis standing by with charged powerpacks connected to superchargers (bonus points for including plugs for other EVs).  

Station a few in Louisville, a few in Birmingham AL, and a few in Salt Lake City.  Would be able to reach most places in a day or so.

Would be able to add capacity to the supercharger network very quickly. Would originally assist with evacuation.

As evacuation slows down, they can find critical infrastructure (hospital, etc) and provide backup power through the powerpacks as needed. 

After a storm (or other disaster) these trucks can supplement the supercharger network in areas that are damaged."
Supercharging is not free anymore? Always thought that was one of the big benefits to owning a Tesla. When did they start charging for it?
"> supper charging

Nice freudian slip.  If superchargers were located the same way gasoline stations rather than prioritizing restaurants nearby I'd be a belt size smaller."
"Yes, because in the long term it hurts the battery. Just like only super charging a battery will hurt it in the long run. 

But totally fine for emergencies and every now then. Kinda like eating junk food. Once every now then won’t hurt you but everyday it will. 

Also older cars had bigger packs but buyer only bought a smaller capacity. "
Some Teslas were sold with batteries limited if you paid less. This unlocks the whole battery 
FWIW they don’t do this anymore.  Software locked battery capacity doesn’t exist on new models. 
I'm not a Tesla engineer but I'm assuming it's a situation similar to how Intel software limits their chips. It's cheaper to manufacture the same item. 
"Keeps the battery in better condition for longer, that's why Teslas in particular have so little range loss over time"
"It's cheaper from a logistical perspective, and allows the owner to upgrade at any time."
">Wait, what?  Software locked battery capacity?Why would they sell the car with extra battery cells?

It's not that the car has extra battery cells, is that they limit the charge capacity of each cell to improve durability. A battery cell that is constantly charged to 100% will degrade faster than a cell charged at say, 80%. All your Li-ion battery devices do the same as to increase the number of cycles the battery will last. 

&#x200B;

In this case, Tesla is saying, ""well, if you are dead those extra cycles of charge will be of no use to you, so go ahead and be safe at the impact of a minor degradation to your battery pack"
It's from previous models that shipped with larger batteries that had low demand. For example some 60kwh Model S shipped with it limited to 40 kwh because the 40 kwh Model S had too low of a demand. So those who ordered a 40kwh Model S got a 60 kwh one instead.
"This is a fairly common practice.  I dont know the full details but its something along these lines:

You produce 2 batteries, a 75kWh and 100kWh...from there they are binned into 4-5 different bins;
60, 75, 80, 90, 100 or whatever kWh...that means by producing 2 batteries you can use nearly 100% of them even though they arent' perfect.  Again this isnt a perfect example since there are cells that make up larger battery modules that can be interchanged and such but largely the idea holds.

Another note as an EE, you can buy test equipment from vendors like Rhode and schwarz...the box or hardware itself is say, $200k but then you can buy another $1.5M in software to unlock the full potential of the hardware."
"Same reason cable companies sell ""basic"" packages, or telecoms companies sell limited data plans.

So people pay extra to have it unlocked."
If you run your Battery to absolute 0% every time  it decrease it capacity overtime.
Maybe you want to upgrade later
Software locked models
But I’m sure free super charging is for everyone
"Tesla discontinued the 60kwh battery, but still offered it by installing a 75kwh battery and limiting it in software (with option for a later over-the-air upgrade) for a while. So people who bought a 75kwh battery optioned down to 60kwh are having that limitation temporarily lifted."

"Tesla owner here (but also the owner of a bunch of petrol cars). They're uniquely positioned to do this. Porsche, GM, MB, etc. don't own any gas stations to give away free gas. "
"I appreciate Tesla, but nothing here sounds better than a gas powered car. "
"While I agree that this is a good thing Tesla is doing, your critique is a bit naive.

&#x200B;

***TL;DR:*** *Tesla does what Tesla does because it's an easy public opinion win where no matter what they do they can only win. ICE and other engine type manufacturers can only loose if they tried the same because of logistics and having to deal with humans interfering.*

&#x200B;

It comes down to infrastructure. A ICE car manufacturer would need to send fuel trucks into that region (with probably very congested streets, creating more congestion wherever they start to refill cars) to give out free refills where Tesla just has to hope that the power grid can supply the chargers and that there are enough available for their customers in any given moment. Removing the restrictions is a good move because it probably spreads the charger usage over a wider area.

Now, coming back to the ICE car manufacturer that decided to send fuel trucks:

*What you would think about the company if they told you the fuel in the truck in front of you is only for customers of a different brand?*

*Even if they supplied all car brands, the moment they run out of fuel the publicity is turned against them.*

&#x200B;

Also, it has to be said that this a problem ICE cars usually do not suffer from. If the shit hits the fan I can just store two jerrycans in the trunk (that I hopefully have stored beforehand) and be on my merry way. If there is not enough fuel available for the gross population the streets will be littered with abandoned vehicles anyway so might as well leave the car in the garage and find some other means of transportation.

You *could grab some beers from the fridge and go to the nearest charging station and drink a cold one with the two Tesla drivers hating the 200 other people clogging up the streets when they ran out of fuel. Might as well make some new friends and watch the destruction unfold.*

&#x200B;

If you need to shame anyone then I would like to propose going for producers of natural gas or fuel cell driven cars.  From what I heard it's nearly impossible to get hydrogen on normal days let alone when a hurricane is moving your way. So even if you tried to be out of there early you still get the shaft."
Is this satire? No other car companies artificially limit the size of their fuel tanks either.
Probably because it's not necessary for other companies (for non-electric vehicles anyway).  There are gas stations every mile from the coast all the way across the country.  Someone with an all electric vehicle might get stranded if they have to stay somewhere without any way to charge their car.
"You could say that gas stations could do ""fill up for free"", but they still have a finite amount of gas."
"These days I'm more concerned with how these giant companies treat their labor.

"Why is Tesla intentionally limited these things to begin with?

If the car had the capacity to do these things already and I paid for it, why are they allowed to turn them off remotely?"
Are you trying to compare remote software patching and remote fee waving to... providing and distributing free portable gas tanks and paying for 3rd party gas pump use?
Well said.
"My gas tank's capacity isn't artificially restricted, so I have 100% fuel capacity all day long."
"One could also say, 'why is Tesla normally restricting my battery capacity even though it's available?  It'd be like an ICE car company installing a rock in your gas tank that takes up space to reduce the amount of gallons you can put in, but if you pay them more money for the upgraded model they'll remove the rock for you.  

They're also not saying they're letting you fill up for free.  You're able to access the supercharging of your battery rather than using the usual longer charging method.  

"
"> What other car company would do that?
> 
> 

Artificially limit the capacity of their cars, unlocking only based on $$ and nothing else?  No one.  No one would."
Most ICE companies wouldn’t lock a feature already in the car behind a paywall. 
Lol Tesla is just doing this has a marketing ploy. You really think this or any company gives a crap about these people. Dont be delusional.
"This is how a company should act? They shipped cars with a certain battery capacity, and then — by software only — limits your ability to use all of that battery.  This is exactly the same as EA or Activision releasing a game where 20% of the content already on the disc is locked until you pay another $20.

Tesla, by doing this, is a slightly more tolerable EA."
No ice car ships with a 30 gallon tank but limits it to 20 gallon unless you pay them thousands.  
Because he got high 
Uhh why is the battery capacity being artificially limited in the first place? Free electricity is nice sure but the battery thing is fucked \<_<

True ownership is a thing of the past.
"I agree. Owning a vehicle shouldn’t be like using ITunes where I constantly gave to read terms of service and it’s constantly changing. While I think the updates that they push are mostly beneficial to the consumer, it’s really asking a lot of that same consumer to let them have access to it.

Only the Model 3 performance gets free supercharging.   The AWD and RWD model 3's you have to pay.  Some of the really old Model S's could have been bought without free supercharging as it was originally an option.    Most Model X and S's have free supercharging though.  
It’s my understanding that it’s  only free on some cars 
During early manufacturing they put the full sized battery even in the cheaper models to help efficiency. They don't do it anymore now that they have it more figured out. 
Yes.

Try taking one around some fast corners
"They've done this in the past, and while the supercharger access is applicable to any vehicle, the extra battery capacity really only applies to those with 75kWh batteries that were software locked to 60kWh. 

Still admirable, but just wanted you and others to know that in general there's not much additional capacity to be had on ""regular"" cars."
Everything isn't a PR move. 
How is it a PR move if this was displayed to the owner of the car? If it was a PR move they'd publish some notice on their website. The only reason the media found out is because owners posting screenshots.
A few cars were software locked to have a smaller battery that Tesla was selling for less money.
They enabled *free* supercharging.  Some models could already supercharge for free but some models can’t.  
The people with software limited battery packs represent a very small percentage of tesla owners.

12 cents per kWh on average in the US. The model 3 has a 50 and 75 kWh battery with a range of 220 and 310 respectively. They take about 75 minutes to full charge from nothing at a Tesla station(they are faster than the standards). It would cost you between $6 and 9$. According to the national average of electric charging prices.

90 people have already asked this question on the thread and it has been explained ad nauseum.  Go read. 
For a short time Tesla offered different capacities of battery.   To simplify manufacturing they made one battery (75kWh) and software locked it if you wanted to pay less and get a smaller battery.   There was no some nefarious plan by Tesla.   It gave the consumer more choice and allowed them to pay for a cheaper price for the car if they didn't need a larger battery.   Plus there was some benefits for the consumer.   They could unlock the extra portion if they wanted to upgrade.   Their supercharging speeds would appear faster because of the software lock.   Battery degradation would also be masked by the software lock.  I don't get how people can think this is a bad thing.   Charging speeds are all the same though.   Don't see where you are getting that is slower unless you pay.    
The capacity is governed to preserve the longevity of the battery. It had nothing to do with paying more. 
You couldn't have gotten it more wrong if you tried lol but good indignation!
It's not free for model 3 owners. Only for S and X. But it's dirt cheap compared to gas. 
"Given the choice I would prefer those 1,000 people not die or be stuck in a terrible storm. What's your position on their safety?"
"No, either via referral code, or you pay for supercharging, All Model 3 non-performance models also pay."
Letting someone wear the shit out of the battery more without charging them an extra warrenty?
They have 100% battery. They also have additional battery reserves which can be enabled remotely. 
"The cheaper cars have the same battery as the more expensive cars, but the battery capacity is software limited, because you know companies like to make money, even after the initial sale... so to streamline manufacturing they have the same battery, but if you don’t pay for the bigger battery they software limit it. "
"This is just pure fiction.  

Edit: I should clarify. Everything about the 70% is mostly true, but this has nothing to do with what Tesla is doing here.  When Tesla started selling less expensive Model S instead of changing their battery manufacturing process they put in the same battery as the more expensive model S and software limited it...  they are just making these cars act like you bought a more expensive car, years ago, for a few weeks. "
"Only on a couple of models.  The first Model S had three versions:  40, 60, 85.  Only the 60 and 85 sold in meaningful numbers, so they were the only batteries made.

"Yes, with the software cap. They did this on some earlier models to make a cheaper price point. I don’t believe that any are like this now.

Nowadays, all the batteries are the size they say (or close) and you are capped by that. You still gotta pay for an actual bigger better though "
"How is it anticompetitive?

If the alternative was not selling the lower priced version to the consumer at all, do you feel that is better?"

Electricity that they purchase from the local grid isn't free. Tesla pays for electricity just like you do. 
That's not what happened here dude. gtfo
"It's not gimped.  You're choosing to pay a lower price for a car, so that maybe now you can actually afford it if it was borderline before.  You can then pay back the price difference on the car and unlock the extra capacity.  Tesla offers this option because they know that most people will exercise it.  If you never do, Tesla actually makes a LOT less on your car.  This increases sales, not profit."

Same with Enhanced Autopilot etc.. the hardware is there, unlocking it is a $5000 (or more?) upgrade. 

That's how Tesla could allow every owner of an AP2 Hardware car a free ""trial"" during the last months...

Same thing with Tesla and their features.. for some models, when they consolidated battery production, they stopped building the smaller batteries, but just software-locked the bigger one to the ordered, smaller (and cheaper) size."
"During early manufacturing they put the full sized battery even in the cheaper models to help efficiency. They don't do it anymore now that they have it more figured out.

For superchargers, those are just charging stations, not features of the car. "
They are doing it so people can evacuate to areas not affected by the storm.
"Imagine if Ford called you during a hurricane and said, hey that car you bought, guess what?  it has a bigger gas tank we didn’t charge you for initially, we’re going to unlock it, oh and by the way, feel free to fill up on us...  no charge, and take care...  also, “we’ll let you know when we’re going to shut that extra tank you never paid for off. “"
From what I know they mostly limit the batteries through software to between 90% and something like 30% to protect the batteries. Keeping the batteries between those levels extends their life greatly
Because then people would only use that and they would not be able to keep a warranty on it because it's not designed to always be using the supercharged mode.
"During early manufacturing they put the full sized battery even in the cheaper models to help efficiency. They don't do it anymore now that they have it more figured out.

The customer is getting exactly what they paid for. "
No. 
"Maybe.  Have they? No. Will they? Very unlikely, the stock would plummet. 

In this case they are increasing battery capacity via OTA software update...

It’s like ford saying hey we’re going to temporarily increase your gas tank size, and also, feel free to stop at our gas stations and top it off, whenever you need for the next few weeks...  as if that would ever happen. "
This question has already been asked a lot on this thread.  Go read the comments.
Go read the comments.  This question has been asked 50 times.  Don’t jump to negative conclusions.  
Go read the comments. 
Older models could opt for a lower price even with a larger physical battery. I imagine it was to make production smoother. They don't do that anymore since they have become more efficient. 
"No, superchargers are just the fast charging stations. If you don't normally have them free, you have to pay for the electricity. "
"Just like you pay $40 to refuel your car, you have to pay $4 in electricity to recharge your car. Imagine if gas stations just said ""It's an emergency and we made a million dollars more than expected last year, so fuck it, let's give free gas to anyone leaving the hurricane!"". That's what Tesla is doing.

>Thats terrifying. Way too much control and power of your vehicle.

Not any more than any other car. They are basically giving free gas."
"No one asks because they have told us, and we already know. Lithium ion batteries live longer if you charge them more slowly, don't let them run to 0, and don't let them charge to 100. So they are giving people a longer battery life, in exchange for a few percent of range on the top and bottom of a charge."
"Common practice. Intel does it with their chips, car manufacturers do it with ECU limits, etc."

Easier to produce. Computer chip producers do the same with memory for example.
They did this on some models because they wanted to offer a cheaper price point early. I don’t believe they do on any of them now.

Batteries last exponentially longer when they are not charged to 100% they limit it below that so you don't have to buy a battery that costs a few thousand dollars in less then half the time if they didn't limit it.

Common practice. Intel i3 i5 and i7 mainstream chips have traditionally been the same silicon with features blocked off. Cheaper than making different chips but allows you to cover a wider price range. Very similar philosiphy to apple charging $100 for the extra storage.
Good not felonies for me then
"Yes, or as if Tesla put Autopilot on every car it made and charges you to activate it."
"Easier to set up one line at first but set up your end capacity via software, then upgrade the production process for the smaller battery."
"For rechargeable batteries like liions/lipos there's a benefit with software limited capacity: the batteries can be kept in a more comfortable range of charge percentage and will last longer / degrade slower in capacity and overall performance like internal resistance and self discharge. A trade-off especially in mobility is the additional weight. But if I where to choose between two cars with same price and same capacity, I'd go for the one with bigger battery and artificial capacity cap instead of the one with that actual capacity."

They do have everyones gps location so I’d assume geolocation
"For the free supercharging it would be based on the supercharger used. Every supercharger cabinet and stall has an ID and they know exactly where it is.

For the pack unlock they can use the cell tower connection / GPS to do the unlock regionally. They don't have to be too tight. They could unlock all the packs in the US or all packs east of the Missippi and it wouldn't hurt anything."

It would void my warranty
"The motor inverter outputs are directly connected to the motor; there is no external wiring for them. The 12V DCDC is limited to about 2kW on its output side. The only way that it would be possible to take significant power out of the car (without physical modification) is to use the mode that the SC uses where the charge controller bridges the raw HV DC to the charge port terminals. Supposing you were able to spoof the SC protocol and get the car to do it, you'd still need an external 300V/400V DC input inverter plus you'd have to contend with any protections that kick in when the onboard charger starts sensing current pouring through in the wrong direction."

They don't need to throttle when you have no reception
My guess (I know nothing about how Teslas work) is that they throttle battery capacity in order to increase the lifetime of the batteries. Could be wrong though.
"That's exactly what is going on. Right now, Tesla batteries are lasting a very long time, and part of the reason is because the entire system is optimised to keep the pack as cool as possible, and to charge it in a narrower profile.

The pack can be charged up to 4.2V per cell, but doing that can slightly degrade the life. You can discharge the pack to 2.8V per cell, but that would also degrade some of its life. 

Since some of the Teslas have a 300-mile range battery pack, the standard charging / discharging protocol limits the charge to 4.05V per cell, and warns you to stop-and-charge as you near 3.3V per cell.

As to the charging rate, with the active cooling, the pack can be charged at a fast and high-amp rate, but the faster you charge it, the warmer the pack gets. Normal charging is at a fairly slow rate, since most people sleep for around eight hours, and that is the time that there are a lot of idling power plants, which causes night rates to be more cost effective (in some areas). 

In an emergency situation, owners may want to fast-charge the pack, even if it gets very warm. Under normal conditions, an owner would have to give up some of the warranty life of the pack. All Tesla owners have always been able to fast-charge, and then fill the pack up to the max possible, and then run them down to a very low LVC (Low Voltage Cutoff). The difference here is that Tesla is saying they won't charge you for doing that."
"They don't throttle anybody.

&#x200B;

Much like your home modem might be capable of 300mbps speed, but you only buy 100mbps?

&#x200B;

Are you being throttled, or are you getting what you paid for?"
I guess it's a win-win then

It's the same with cars nowadays. They hold an extra gallon of gas that isn't displayed. That's why it always feels like you've been running on an empty tank forever. 
They haven't ever made 80 kWh packs.  This is only about the software limited S60 that were actually 75 kWh packs
That's really fucking shitty that they'd lock out shit on your car. That's basically on-disk DLC.
Clearly never downloaded a car either. What a chump.
"Friendly advice: battery capacity is measured in kWh, not kW."
This is incorrect.  They’re referring to the old S60 models that were software limited 75kwh packs. They don’t sell any new modes with software limited packs anymore. 
"I made a post in TIL about this a few weeks ago. Seems like everyone wants to spin it as paying less for less battery usage rather than marking up prices to fully use the battery you are buying.

This is incorrect.  They’re referring to the old S60 models that had software limited 75kwh packs.  They don’t sell new models with software limited packs anymore.
I think this is right. It used to be the case that the 60's were software limited 75s.
"They needed to meet a low price target for the lower end cars, and maintain the medium and high range prices.

Since they were only making 2 batteries they had to make one car worse or else why would anyone buy the mid-range if it’s the same exact car?

"Also the battery will last longer if it's emptied less, so win-win."
"Chip limiting has more to do with the fact that the same process yields different results depending on the quality of the silicon. So after the chips are made, they are graded and restricted to their true capability."
I think some models are sold with the larger battery pack but software limited in exchange for a price reduction. It also allows for people to upgrade their car if their needs change. 
Actually they are talking about a battery with extra cells.   For a short time Tesla Sold batteries that were actually larger and you could have paid for a 60 kWh battery.   To reduce manufacturing headaches they just made one larger battery and software locked the battery.   So you could have paid to unlock the extra capacity later on or in this case they can just remotely unlock it so the car now could use the extra capacity.   
There should just be an emergency mode that can be manually activated for non-nationwide emergencies. Don't want to run out 5 miles before you reach a hospital with a wife in labour or whatever.
"Thank you for a reply that doesn't require me to be smart to understand. I think there's a lot of suspicion in this thread about Tesla purposely holding back capacity, without an ELI5 reasoning being put out."
"Exactly. This is fairly common in quality management, best batteries are open for more charge essentially. It works the same for processors, storage etc. Another good example is in Monitors.

They limit it like that because too low charges are not good for battery life.
"true, but what company would offer free ""fuel"" to those in a  disaster?   I think that was OPs comment.  "
"But its also free Supercharging.  So, the equivalent would be to send verified owners of your cars money to pay for gasoline during the crisis."
"They do with their engines. Same engines, tuned differently with different horse power, torque and fuel mileage."
So true! 
What is this ICE 
With a normal car you could literally add as much fuel capacity as you liked on your own and relatively easily. So you could increase your range from 100 miles to like 500 in about an hour. You'd have to pay for extra fuel but it wouldn't be hard to do.
Sure they do. There is always more room for gas...just put it in the bed of your F150.
"There are ICE cars that have electronically limited performance unless you buy the performance pack though. And increasing the fuel efficiency via software update is completely possible, it's called Chip Tuning."

I believe in this situation they are letting you tap into the reserve battery. Its because the batteries lose charge over time and this way you get about the same range for 10 years as opposed to 3.

They didn't limit anything.   You got exactly what you paid for.    If you bought a 75 kWh battery that was software locked to 60 kWh then you didn't pay for a 75kWh battery.   You paid for the 60kWh.   
"Would you feel better if they gave you a smaller battery that was more accurate to the size that you purchased? 

Because with the limit on a big battery it's not only cheaper for tesla to manufacture, but it's also much much better for the lifespan of the battery. "

"It's free for pretty much every Model S, Model X and Model 3 Performance."

I’m pretty sure if I read the Tesla sales agreement it’s probably like iOS on apple devices or OS X on pc. You rent the os bullshit. 

Bottom line they sold it and software limited it. Meaning they already absorb the price. They gain shit. So no there is no justification. 

You don’t fill up on Tesla. You fill up on taxpayers. Don’t confuse the two. 

Also fast charting is awesome. It also 1/3 the battery life. But who gives a fuck. Most people hang off Tesla’s nuts. 

"
"Oh, I see now. Thank you."
"still bollocks... if it's cheaper to give everyone the same battery, just give everyone the same battery capacity then. Im sure there were other things in that cheaper model that made it cheaper, why intentionally cripple something included anyway. /r/assholedesign

edit: oh no, did I swear in church or something? you guys same as apple fanboys? cant see fault in your obsessed over product range?"
"Maybe I don't understand, the capacity is there, it's able to handle 75kWh. I'm supposed to believe they didn't work the full price of the battery and the software into the cost of the locked down 60 kWh battery? 

Other articles I read said that that extra 15 kWh only accounts for at most 40 more miles. So if I'm shelling out the money for an electric car (a Tesla to boot) why wouldn't I just buy the unlocked larger capacity battery? Is the price differential really that much that it's going to make or break the deal? If thats the case maybe I shouldnt buy a Tesla at all. If its cheap enough to swing, why did Tesla go out of their way to create a software that is going to lock down the full capabilities of the battery? If it makes more sense and is cheaper for them to have a single battery that is configurable, is the price of that car the same or cheaper than a model with a straight up 60 kWh battery? 

Also 

>Their supercharging speeds would appear faster because of the software lock.

But then 

>Charging speeds are all the same though.

Why would the software make it appear to be charging faster even though its charging at the same speed? 

Maybe not outright nefarious but to me it all sounds very sus. 
"
This is incorrect.  They’re referring to the S60s that had software limited 75kw battery packs. 
Ooooh ok! What about the supercharge? 
Interesting
"Only free for S and X owners who used a referral code (which I imagine is the vast majority, but not all)"
"Good for those 1000 people, but LOL at Musk's self advertising"
Lots of “hey that’s great” and “wait a minute” I say 
No. 
"Nope.  Tesla and everyone else all slightly derate the batteries.  Tesla blocks off a couple of percent at the bottom to protect the battery from over discharge, and also caps the individual cell voltage about .04 volts below maximum rated spec, which is for a range of charge of about ..9 volts from fully charged to fully discharged."
"*Yes.* Because the lower price tier is dumping. They're spending the money to deliver a high-quality product and then doing additional work to make it objectively worse. They are selling people the fully-capable hardware and making that hardware lie about its capabilities!

This behavior prevents newcomers from competing on price. A lesser company can't just sell a cheaper car at similar margins. Tesla can price their products arbitrarily low - even below cost. In consumers' minds, the framing effect of multiple tiers justifies an inflated higher price tier, even if the products are physically identical. "

"What shitty logic. You can install trackers and remote lock outs / shut downs on almost any car yourself.

Try again."
"i'd sell it and get another vehicle, they lied to me."
The battery is the same size on all cars but they fuck you over and limit you 
"It is gimped. You have a car, that is physically capable of better performance, but it is locked behind software. They took a good thing and made it worse. That is what gimped means.

If a car is physically capable of performance, it should be sold with the ability to utilize that performance.

I couldn't care less about Tesla sales or profit. This is ridiculous."
"Interesting, thanks for he knowledge "
"I have the charger at home of course but the place I work at has a supercharger that I use before I take off. 

"
How much is it?
"> They don't do it anymore now that they have it more figured out.

Ah, I see. That makes sense.

>For superchargers, those are just charging stations, not features of the car. 

Also makes sense. So it's like premium service for the fancier car."
Who says you didn’t pay for it? You bought the whole battery at a markup from production cost. You bought the whole battery unit. They just have software to control it
Next question: Why can they do it remotely and on a whim 
"This isn’t true. A better analogy is: Imagine if Ford called you during a hurricane and said, hey that car you bought, guess what?  it has a bigger gas tank we didn’t charge you for initially, we’re going to unlock it, oh and by the way, feel free to fill up on us...  no charge, and take care...  also, “we’ll let you know when we’re going to shut that extra tank you never paid for off. “"
"Well at least give the consumer the choice. Say the warranty is void if you use it, thats easy. You can keep a log no problem. The mentality of ""we know whats better for you and are going to lock you out of our product"" is harmful for consumers."
"You don’t know what you’re taking about. Tesla made a battery pack, and realized some people didn’t want that much range (that big of a battery) and so considered making a smaller pack, but realized it was too much reengineering so they kept making the same battery pack, but in order to sell more said, let’s sell the same car for cheaper but software limit the battery pack, so that the people who bought the bigger battery don’t feel ripped off, and maybe get more revenue later when people opt to unlock the bigger battery, but either way we still make some revenue on the car, just a little less on the software limited battery...  this is just tesla saying if you bought the cheaper car, we’re going to make it act/charge like the more expensive car for the next several weeks,so you can get to safety.

Sorry I didn't read through all the comments before I asked a question
Comments are doing nothing but confirming what I said. 
"More shitty logic, what the hell. The only way to charge your car is via Tesla charging stations right? They have full power and control over you. I can get my diesel fuel from where ever I want and my fuel capacity is always going to be a set amount. No one can limit or increase it.

You people are delusional lol."
"The owner ostensibly ‘owns’ the vehicle and should always have the capability of accessing that mode of their own volition, without needing Tesla permission first. If the owner decided they want access to more range at the expense of needing a replacement battery sooner, that should be their choice. "
"Right, so we get to the point of it. Market segmentation and money. 

To borrow a phrase from the gaming community, this is like on-disc DLC. You’ve already produced it, and agreed that you can sell it for less, so why charge me again later?

It’s clear that they can actually sell the car for less money. They wanted to move more units, but rather than just lower the price of the car as-is over time until they hit their sales projections, they spent the same amount of money producing the car and cut down a working feature to protect the ego of their earlier buyers who spent more. It would be a different situation if they were putting batteries with a bad cell or something in there, but people are getting the exact same car with a software patch that pretends the battery is dead when it’s not. All for the sake of what? Keeping wealthy customers feeling special?"
You are correct.  the current 75 and 100 kWh batteries are physically different.   
Oh nice. Thanks for the answer 
Cool didnt know that
dude you have given the same response to every single person in this thread. pathetic

Ford has no clue where my truck is. Not out of touch just not fond of this kind of crap.
Didn't realize they used NiCd batteries if that's the case.
"This is incorrect.  They’re referring to the old software limited S60 models that had 75kwh batteries.  But yes, go read the comments. "
Wtf you mean they didn't charge you for it?  You definitely for sure paid for it
"The same production cost, arbitrarily limited to capture more of the market?"
"Not exactly. My understanding is the i3 is a different chip completely, similar to the Celeron chips but has extra L3 cache. "

"A 100kwh battery can output 1700amps under ludicrous launch scenarios, the average home is only wired for 200 amps total so amp draw will never be a huge problem for our car's batteries.  The average home's electrical use is 20kwh per day which would give roughly 5 days of power to most homes, but this varies wildly around the world based on geography and economic status.  Most of us here by virtue of owning cars that cost 2-4x the average new vehicle price probably use double the average kwh per day to power our homes too, so that's going to impact how long you can keep your personal house powered on a car battery also.  TLDR:  Yes neat! "

"My opinion doesn't matter, free supercharging is going away and I have no ability to change that fact.  But since it is going away, truck buyers can have the ability to connect their truck to the grid and power homes with a car battery.   This is technically not difficult, but with free supercharging people would be doing this to avoid paying for home electricity all year round the same way taxi services use teslas for free fuel."
"The home batteries are only ~7 kwh too.  They're good for maybe 8 hours of backup power, but are nothing compared to a 100kwh car battery."

"It’s a pay tier. Tesla saves money by only stocking one battery, but still needs a reason to charge people more for the higher trim level so they put software limits on the battery capacity for the “base”. Basically, they locked hardware behind a paywall. "
"Probably a combination of this, and the comments below. "
"That could be a valid reason, sure, but then people can opt-in to pay more to unlock the full battery anyway. So why not let users be the judge when it comes to how much power they need."
"Yes, here is an article on that [https://www.electricbike.com/how-to-make-lithium-battery-last/](https://www.electricbike.com/how-to-make-lithium-battery-last/)"
"yes, it's throttled.. because that's what you pay for.
Now , a car is not internet, it's physical.. I don't believe Tesla should limit price because of software"
"Yes, in both cases you actually are.

I'm paying for infrastructure and signals to travel over wire. If it can handle 300Mbs and you're giving me 100, I'm being throttled for profit. 

It doesn't cost companies more to send 300 vs 100 Mbs over the same lines. They tell you that because they want an excuse to make more money through tiered services."
A shining example of how capitalism is supposed to work.
"Haha no, they throttled the fire fighters after they went over 22 GB of their “unlimited” plan down to unusable speeds preventing them from securely communicating with other fire officials and emergency services. They had to start using their personal data plans and hotspots to barely get by. "

"isn't it more like, the floating thingy in your tank that gives feedback to the indicator has a diameter of more than zero, so once it's sitting at the bottom of the tank, you still have whatever height of it is usually submerged in the tank, even though it indicates 0?"

"The original model s came in 40kw, 60kw, and 80kw capacities.

EDIT: Missed a key"
"ahh, that's right my bad it's 85 that's 90 isn't it"
"Technically they have, the ""85"" packs are 80kwh in capacity.  The ""90"" packs are actually 85kwh capacity.  Most of the other packs are what they claim to be.   

The Model 3 LR battery is also an 80kwh pack, though they don't make any claims to its actual storage capacity."
I could be wrong but it might be something to do with the life of the battery. When youre charging it up to max capacity vs keeping it at approx. 90%. Less strain on the battery the longer it lasts. Im sure they cells/battery isnt cheap. 
"I don't know if it's this way for Tesla batteries, but I assume so given that they can temporarily up the capacity:

&#x200B;

Batteries in modern electronics are all restricted from using the entire capacity that they're manufactured with. Your phone battery does it.

It's for longevity - they can rotate which cells get used to keep overall wear down across all of them, or they can isolate cells as they die and activate the leftover/extra/surplus cells to replace them so the usable capacity for the end-user doesn't go down.

&#x200B;

At least that's what I've been told. I'm far from a battery expert and I don't even play one on the internet."
"Actually it much better for the user. It means the user doesnt have to pay $6500 for a battery replacement and instead will have a functioning vehicle. Batteries that arent fully charged every time are able to yield more charge cycles, which then allows for a longer use of the battery. This is much better to the alternative where you can watch maximum possible distance on your tesla drop before youre eyes.

What youre complaining about is like an old man being furious that his attic isnt viable living space. Its there to make everything else better and more insulated in your house as well as store the AC unit. Getting mad just because youre ""locked out"" of using it undercuts the engineers who thought ahead to solve the problems that people like you would complain about"
"It’s actually smart. It’s cheaper for them to make only one kind of battery. And if the user buys the cheaper, smaller battery, version they can always upgrade. It’d be more shitty if you bought the cheaper version and you had to buy a whole new battery or even car to upgrade. "
I believe they are enabling the battery to overdischarge. Overdischarging reduces the life of batteries. It is good they limit it otherwise people would often do this not knowing the consequences.
Id hate that. It's like when I got a printer and found out they limited me to 10 pages a month unless I paid their subscription. Dude I bought a device not your personal cash machine.

"Generally, large ompanies have people working emergency management ib some resoect already, if only for contingency/continuity of operations planning. You never know where or when a disaster can strike, and if it strikes more critical parts of your operation and you don't have plans in place to help deal with it, it's very not good. 

Also, federal, state, and local emergency management doctrine heavily involve working with private and public organizations, including industry, to aide during disaster response. These connections are generally happening long before a disaster strikes, so thay agencies and organizations can build a rapport and work better with each other when the time comes."
"uh, because Tesla...


Semi trailers with batteries (and solar panels, thanks u/JackJackson1SG8 for the suggestion), with a connection to the grid is possibly a more sustainable (sustainable as in long lasting, not as in the environment) long term energy storage than a generator with a few fuel tankers."
"Because that requires more assets than what I proposed.  I was proposing using 5 semis for the whole country, this Fema map shows 10 locations, and each location would likely require more than 1 semi.  Maybe this would be the eventual goal, but to start with fewer assets (ie, capital), I think my 3 locations are just fine."

For what it’s worth
"""I've had my phone for 4 years, and now the battery life sucks! Grahh! Planned obsolescence!"""
"When Intel makes CPUs they only make the top line CPU. Some turn out good, some turn out bad. The ones that turn bad gets the clockspeed dropped down, or a bad core disabled. And then they sell it as a lower tier CPU. Inside they all look exactly the same.

The ones that turn out really good are the ones that are easy to overclock. They don't take any damage from overclocking if you keep temperatures low enough."
"Not necessarily, if demand is high enough for the lower tier then perfectly good chips will be cut down to the lower price point to satisfy demand.  Occasionally it is possible to unlock a CPU or graphics card to a higher specification if the chip in question was software locked rather than having traces lasered off.  And example is that many of AMD's 56 CU Fury cards could have their bios swapped to unlock them into 64 CU Fury X cards.  Same story with may RX 460's being unlockable from 14 CU's to 16 CU's.

Another example is that many Phenom II x3 chips could be unlocked to a full 4 cores."
Yep this should be higher
"also some cores sometimes dont work, so you get things like restricted quad cores as dual cores, or even triple core cpus"
It’s not manufacturing headaches. It’s economics of scale. You can produce one cheaper than two.
It was cheaper and also easy money by making people pay to “upgrade.”

"Everyone wants the 8-year battery warranty, and they will damn sure sue Tesla if the battery doesn't live up to the spec. Then some guy will find a way to hack into it, supercharge very fast every day, charge to an extra high voltage, drain it down past the built-in safety features that normally protect the battery, and then after a couple years?...they will be screaming that they only have half the range they paid for.

There may be a little extra range built into the battery that you normally can't access, but...you are still getting every watt-hour of range that you paid for, and you have to initial a paper saying that you understand that when you bought it. Nothing was hidden."

"I drive a 2006 Honda CR-V which averages 26.5 mpg, and has a 15 gallon tank. I have fit 7 kegs of beer simultaneously in it before, and I'll assume a keg of beer has about the same cargo footprint a a 5-gallon gas can. That gives me 5 * 7 + 15 = 50 gallons of fuel, and 50 * 26.5 = 1325 miles.

It would probably take about 15 minutes to purchase and fill 7 gas cans and bungie them down in the back."
Most people pay with credit cards. Could easily be refunded.
Mainly it's companies not wanting to be seen to be profiteering off of natural disasters.
"Not really. This only applies to cars that are software-locked to a smaller battery size. So if you have a S60 that has a 75kwh battery, they are unlocking it for free for a short duration of time. Perfectly ok. Heck, you could just pay the money and unlock the 75kwh battery. "
Why wouldn't it be optimal? 
"I disagree. I think it’s more like an upgrade from a 17 gallon tank to a 21 gallon tank. You can pay to have the software limit removed, but it was always a 21 gallon tank to begin with. "

"I’ll tell it to the people I see waiting daily at my local supercharger.

Don’t get me wrong, I like Tesla’s but if I had to flee from somewhere I much rather do it in a gas car. Waiting 10-15 minutes in a gas line still beats waiting at a supercharger plus the ~30minutes of charging."
Or when the gas stations run dry because of all the people trying to evacuate.   
"How is that worse than charging a car? Normal fueling takes 3 minutes, supercharging takes how long? And standard charging? I'd rather wait in line at a chaotic gas station or fill up elsewhere while already having evacuated. 

My parents were in the direct path and filled up just fine earlier this week. They would be able to drive completely out of harm's way without refueling, or stay put and have 2 weeks worth of gas. 

Don't get me wrong, I think under normal circumstances Teslas are great."

"Going faster than 50mph also adds more wear on your car, we should limit peoples speed. "
"Dumb question, but according to other people in the thread, small charges are why it wears it down. Like charging only 10 or 20 percent. Why can't they have a limit at which the charging will start (say 80%) that way you can have the best of both worlds? Batteries last longer and customers have the entire battery capability from the start."
"Yeah but you've got to admit that sounds horrible. And a waste of resources as well.

If I bought the car that has a 75kwh battery then I'd want to use all of it instead of paying another 5k plus to ""unlock"" it"

They’re only doing it for certain older models that had software limited battery capacities.  They don’t sell software limited battery packs anymore
Supercharging is charging really fast at Supercharge locations. All Tesla’s can do it but newer customers normally need to pay
But it would cost more to manufacture different 60kw and 75kw models 
"A negative for Tesla profitability, yeah maybe.

A negative for the consumer?  Absolutely not. "
Haha. I bet. 
Until there's a country-wide *fast* charging network... the Bolt is not great for anything other than a commuter car.  Unless you like waiting a LONG time.
I test drove a model s 5 years ago and got my 3 in May. knew after the s my previous car was my last ICE. 
That's like asking why you have to pay for gas... 
"No, it's a charging service, not something built into the car. Tesla has 'superchargers' at various locations throughout the country. Some models include free access, some don't."
All models can supercharge.  Just not for free. 
People got what they paid for.  They are all happy too.
"Well NONE of tesla cars have 100%, the highest is 68% capacity. Why? Because you might be able to charge it 100 times to 100%, but you can charge it 5000 times to 60%. Tesla just gave a discount to those who didn't need the range knowing that they wouldn't need repairs because as the battery wears it's range is the same. "
"Imagine if Ford called you during a hurricane and said, hey that car you bought, guess what?  it has a bigger gas tank we didn’t charge you for initially, we’re going to unlock it, oh and by the way, feel free to fill up on us...  no charge, and take care...  also, “we’ll let you know when we’re going to shut that extra tank you never paid for off. “"
"Ah yes, people caught in the path of a hurricane don't deserve assistance because I don't like the time they were born /s"

"Note that you can't unlock extra battery capacity because this applies only to some very few cars that were sold a few years back.

If they did that as the normal config the car would cost more.
"That only applies to a few cars.

Tesla was selling cars with a 60kWh battery and a 75kWh battery.

They discontinued the 60kWh option but had to fulfill several orders so instead of wasting money making these batteries they just software locked the 75kWh batteries so only 60kWh were available to the owners, so exactly what they ordered at the price they ordered it.

Additionally, Tesla gave those same owners the option to unlock the extra capacity and essentially have a better car without having to buy a new car."
It provides lower cost entry point for buyers.  They received a better product that they could upgrade at a later point in time.  It’s Tesla giving a customer more because it’s just more efficient to have fewer variations.
This is literally done everywhere. It's called price segmentation and it is beneficial for both producer and consumer. 
"It's not cheaper to give everyone the same battery.

Tesla had some orders for cars with smaller batteries and instead of cancelling them they just software locked larger batteries so the end result was the same."
But but but Tesla is the greatest!!!!1
"Like I said supercharging speeds would APPEAR to be faster.    Fast charging a battery does not happen at a constant speed.  If it is empty or almost empty it can charge very fast but then begins to taper as the battery gets more full.   This is especially true when the battery gets to over 80 percent.    Because part of the top of the battery is locked on a software locked battery then charging would appear to happen at quicker rate especially if you go right to 100 percent.   

&#x200B;

Yes the larger battery can be significantly more.  On the model 3 the long range battery is a $9000 upgrade.   That would give you something like 70-90 more miles of range.    So in this case people chose to spend less and get the 60 kWh battery.    "
[deleted]
"Ah, my mistake. "
Superchargers are charging stations. So those people can stop and charge at no cost. It would be like your car company giving you free gas. 
I paid about $8.50 for a charge that would have cost me about $40 in gas. 
Charging your car at a Tesla supercharger is not free. 
"I paid $5 each way to the beach and back (from Hickory, NC, to Cherry Grove, NC), one stop each way."
"Yes, but that has nothing to do with this..."
It would cost them more to have designed a smaller battery and retrofitted the factories to handle both kinds.
"Yes, but that's not a Karma.  Karma batteries were air cooled and vented.  Tesla's are sealed."
"Supercharging is relatively cheap.  A fraction of filling a gas tank.  I’ve never spent more than $10.

I’m not sure what you mean by “regular charging” but most people charge at home most of the time, and they pay for the electricity on their electric bill. "
"Your comment is divorced from reality. The owner has full control of SOC, and providing access to supercharging doesn't have any impact on battery wear, its up to you to take advantage of it or not. This isn't rocket surgery man

&#x200B;"
">  But were software limiting it to make it cheaper

Ok perhaps a bit sarcastic, but my point was that reducing some performance metric in favor of another it's done all the time. ICE ECU's are a good example. 

Typically ICE owners can ""flash"" the computer on their cars to increase power. That power comes at the cost of range, fuel economy and durability.

In this case, Tesla trades in some range loss for decreased degradation. The battery is already sized appropriately sized for the task including the few extra unused kwh."
"Wow, a company trying to make money.....unheard of, right?  "
"Who lied to you?  This was very much known, when they decided to reduce the cars range via software and keep the same hardware, and charge less if you weren’t using it.  Tesla decided it was more costly to change the production line than to sell the same hardware at a lower price...  the same is true with many other Tesla features you can buy...  and if you don’t buy them the hardware is in the car, but it just doesn’t work...  

Seat heaters is a good example...  when the model 3 first was delivered there were no rear seat heaters, a few months later, all of the sudden everyone had rear seat heaters...at no cost.  The hardware was their for seat heaters and they turned it on...  this is the same thing. You’re getting something you didn’t pay for, and didn’t expect when you bought the car.  "
"No it's not.

This only happened to **very few** cars some years back because Tesla didn't want to cancel those orders.

If you don't have an S 60 you definitely don't have a larger battery."
"a handful of people who ordered a certain battery size while it was being phased out were given a larger physical battery which was software limited to what they paid for and offered the chance to upgrade later for a fee.  

we're talking maybe a couple hundred cars in the world with that configuration.  the main thing the article is referring to is free charging for those evacuating - comparable would be free gas"
Isn’t that the same as software programs. Pay to unlock pro versions
"That's not how the world works.  Lots of features in devices need to be activated.

Back several years ago, many security recorders used video encoding schemes that were not open and free, but were actually expensive.  To keep the costs down, the difference between a networkable recorder that can record 4 channels, vs 8, vs 12, was the number of channel licenses the unit carried.  A four channel unit was physically capable of recording 12, but it was prevented by a software lockout.  The manufacturer made three physical configurations, (1, 2, and 4 processors), but sold the units in various configurations by number of channels (4,8,12,16,24, 32, 48) but you could always unlock.it further as long as the unit had enough video processors in it (one per 12 channels) to record the number of channels you wanted.  A 32 channel recorder actually was sold with you locked out of 16 channels of capacity.  Each four channels to add was about $300.  Sure, the company was making a bit of extra money, but at the time, the codec designer massively overcharged for it and the manufacturer was able to keep the costs down for the end user.

There are lots of similar things.  Manufacturers have put a soggy camshaft in a lower end version of a car, just to keep it from cannibalizing sales from the ""sport"" versions.  The two engines cost the same to build, but one could produce up to 100 HP less due to the camera, physically restricted intake, and computer mapping.

My point is that in this situation, Tesla was offering to not charge you for a featured the vehicle physically had, and since you weren't paying for it, they prevented you from using that feature. Would you rather have the been making a 60 battery again, when they knew it would not be a big seller?  This would have mandated that the 60 car cost more, as well as driving up the cost of upgrades when consumers got sick of their bottom of the line batteries.

The bottom line is simple...  If you don't want something that's limited, don't buy it. This was something that was full disclosed well before purchase, basically from the first minute, that the 60 was a capped 75.  This wasn't something they hid.  This was something the owners optes into."

"Superchargers are just ""level 3"" chargers. They can charge your car super fast but will work with any Tesla. "
"What don’t you get?  They manufactured the same battery and sold it in other cars for 15 grand more...  And looked at making a smaller battery, and said, its not worth changing the manufacturing process let’s sell it for cheaper, and software limit it and at least make some revenue from people who can’t afford the big battery instead of no revenue...  and now they are saying, hey even though you didn’t cough up the big bucks for the big battery, please enjoy a few weeks of extra range on us, and also, feel free to fill it up on us too. "
Because they designed the system to work like that. Also it's very good marketing.
"It's a software limit, Not a hardware limit. So at 90% the software cuts off the charging current, and at what ever low end percent the software tells the car it can't go any more. The reason it can be remote is like OnStar in a Chevy, it is always connected to the mother ship (or more likely it reaches out to the company server every so often)"
That's why aftermarket modifications exist I'm sure that will be an option sooner or later.
"You don’t know what you’re taking about. 

Tesla made a battery pack, and realized some people didn’t want that much range (that big of a battery) and so considered making a smaller pack so that cost could be dropped...  but they realized it was too much reengineering so they kept making the same battery pack, but in order to sell more said, “let’s sell the same car for cheaper but software limit the battery pack””, so that the people who bought the bigger battery don’t feel ripped off, and maybe get more revenue later when people opt to unlock the bigger battery, but either way we still make some revenue on the car, just a little less on the software limited battery...” this is just tesla saying if you bought the cheaper car, we’re going to make it act/charge like the more expensive car for the next several weeks,so you can get to safety. 

"
This is incorrect.  Read the sticked comment.
Ctrl+F our your application's equivalent is your friend here. 
There is a small subset of cars that have a software locked battery.   At the time to simplify manufacturing Tesla made one battery and software locked it if you only wanted to pay for a 60 kWh car.   These are the cars that can be unlocked.   They don't do this anymore.  The current Model S batteries are either 75 or 100 kWh and those batteries are physically different sizes.     And the capacity isn't throttled.   It just software locks a portion on the battery.   The consumer knew this when they bought the car.   
"No, you can charge your car from ANY electric station by ANY company. You can CHOOSE to use Tesla chargers because they are free/discounted, but if you don't want to, most gas stations have at least one electric charger in the back. "
What a dummy. 
WTF? 
"Tell that to any phone manufacturer. Sure I get it. But most people don't want that hassle or expense, they want a car that lasts 10 years."
"> Market segmentation and money.

No it's not.

> To borrow a phrase from the gaming community, this is like on-disc DLC. You’ve already produced it, and agreed that you can sell it for less, so why charge me again later?

Again, no its not. Say PS4 makes games generally available for $60. This lets you buy the game for $40 and later pay the extra $20 if you like the game enough to get the whole thing. You also have the option of paying the normal $60 you would have had to pay anyway. It doesn't increase the net price of the car, it reduces it or makes it the same as before.

Also this isn't a practice done on any currently sold Tesla vehicles.

> They wanted to move more units, but rather than just lower the price of the car as-is over time until they hit their sales projections, they spent the same amount of money producing the car and cut down a working feature to protect the ego of their earlier buyers who spent more.

Producing an additional model costs a lot of money, especially if the demand for a such a model is low (it was). The options are either deny access to those who can't afford the more expensive car or allow access via selling the vehicle for reduced margin with capability limited."

Then they couldn't give you a warranty on your battery life.
"The 75kwh is actually 100kwh, but smartphone batteries wear after a year and tesla wears out after 20 years because of this. They let you charge to 100% of the 68% capacity lol. Basically, if you REALLY want you can unlock your battery to double the range, but Tesla doesnt want this because theyd have lots of warrenty repairs for batteries lasting 6 months. They decided to charge less for the car, instead of just making the more expensive one cost more for warrenty."
They don't.  They are Lithium Ion.  
Yep. Although it was really uncommon for i3s to be binned i7s. It is pretty common for a shitty 6core i7 to have 2 cores disabled and get sold as an i5. Great for consumers since it leads to less waste and therefore cheaper CPUs and some lucky bastard gets an i5 that is way better than normal.
"No, sometimes the entire chip isn't working. So they just disable parts of it not going to be used. This is especially true for flash memory."
"Exactly. Some people are willing to pay 200 some are willing to pay 400. If you just sold it at 200 youd muss out on the extra from the 400 guys, if you sold at 400 youd miss out on the 200 guys completely. Still have to have some difference in the product the customer gets to juistify their purchase."
"Correct. It's a common practice called ""tiered pricing"". I've designed products that can be controlled by a factory automation network, or manually. It's the same hardware, but there was a ton of work to develop the software needed for robotic control. Even though it's the same hardware, we don't make the manual users pay more to fund the development of the robotic features, and we don't let robotic users buy a manual system to avoid paying more.

Chips are the same. The added features of a better model of the chip take time to develop. Optimizing for speed takes time to develop. Laying out a chip takes a ton of work. You layout one chip, but you don't make everyone pay for the features that not everyone needs or would want to pay for."
">The same production cost, arbitrarily limited to capture more of the market?

It is typically cheaper production cost.  This type of stuff happens when the tooling, changeover, capacity and complexity cost to support two products will exceed the raw material cost of the excess.  As Tesla was still small, this made sense.  It wouldn't in the case of the 3.  "
"Maybe currently or different models for sure  but its dedinitely been a very common thing they did. I7s were full chips 4 cores 4 ht. The i5s were the same chip with no ht just 4 cores. And the i3 was basically half the chip disabled with 2 cores with ht
 That would halve the cache too i believe"
"I get what you mean, but wouldn’t that be paywalled content, because you don’t have to DownLoad the Content"
Not really but there are some similarities.

"I assume if you're hooking up your car to power your house you'll use as little power as possible though, that would help somewhat. Maybe don't run the AC 24/7 after the hurricane?

I could see the bigger issue being that by draining the car battery you're eliminating your ability to leave if you need to. I guess things would either have to be so bad driving isn't an option anyways or relatively ok enough that you're sure power will be back in 2-3 days.

For comparison: My car has 300hp (223kW), but it needs almost 1000hp of energy (772kW) to make that much power because of losses. My 22kW whole home generator has a 26kW motor, that's 36hp, and needs 86kW of energy to make that. "

Bingo! This is also the reason why you can't grasp how people can support the removal of subsidies for EVs as well as removing environmental regulations which stand in the way of fossil fuels power plants. Given the abundance of coal and natural gas in the US , power plants could produce electricity at lower prices than India or China, with the only side effect of causing some problems to those who'd inhabit the Earth 250-500 years from now. 

People who are insulated in their bubble of wealth like Tesla owners (not to mention the CEO) fail to grasp how this is an excellent deal for the avarage American and they'd support it with their wallets and their vote."

"By simply using the car as a stationary power source it voids the warranty.

"At&t had free charging stations in Houston during Harvey. They are giving needed assistance, but also getting great publicity"
And they don't do it anymore. It was a fairly limited run
"But they only charged you for the lower amount of energy that the battery holds.  This allows you to get all of the features of the higher cost model with a smaller battery pack, at a reduced price.

Also, you can choose to unlock the extra capacity if you pay the extra money, and you can do this at any time.

This is a common practice in many industries both hardware and software."
Ok.
I used to drugs. I still do. But I used to also.
"I like having a physical reserve switch, like on my motorcycle. If I ""run out"" of gas, I flip the switch and can go another 10 miles or so."
"Your reserve fuel tank is a trick by the car companies. The dimmer set to ""empty"" on purpose earlier to consume your understanding that you need to get gas now or you will definitely run out of fuel in the next 30km or so. 

The reserve fuel is still the same gas in your gas tank, just the dimmer sets at empty a lot sooner.

"I think it's changed recently. I am getting some photos together for a post for mildly infuriating showing my car at 100 miles for the first 1/4, 200 miles at the next 1/4, but then the last half is just slightly over 300 total.

Yea but he didn't expect you to call him out for talking out of his ass
"Also, when you gas up, that reserve gets filled. In a Tesla, you don't get to access that extra bit bit of juice unless Elon says."
This would be like if they sealed off a portion of your gas tank then offered to have a guy remove the barrier they placed if you give them money lol. In a way it's kind of like video game companies removing access to content that would have been in the game at release in favor of selling it as DLC later down the road
Except it’s not. They design it that way to increase the efficiency of the battery. They aren’t giving this to people who pay more. They are doing  now this despite the possibility of it shortening the life of your battery. 
I'm high and this seems revolutionary
"That's awful, they throttle their own product? Why? "
"Yeah. In this case, the ""fake restriction"" makes a lot of sense. This is actually a pretty smart descision on Tesla's part. I would defenitly not want to buy a Tesla  from someone who ran their car down to the *true* 0%, or charged it up to the *true* 100% every day. That can really hurt the battery."
"You are not wrong. Every EV manufacturer is doing this. They add spare capacity and then open it up when the cells start degrading. 

Hard drives and SSDs do the same. They include spare sectors/cells. When a sector/cell is detected as faulty, the drives firmware will stop using it and swap in a spwre (so capacity stays the same)."
"> I could be wrong but it might be something to do with the life of the battery.

If that were the case, they wouldn't offer an option to unlock it for some extra money. It's just a cash grab, nothing more."
"> they can rotate which cells get used 

That part is not true, most batteries in phones are 1 or 2 cells. The restriction is because in a given cell, charging it to 100% all the time reduces life span. In the Tesla there are thousands (hundreds?) of individual cells, but I doubt they rotate between them because charging all of them to 80-90% will be better for battery longevity than charging 80-90% of the cells to 100%."
This is correct as far as I know too. 
"I'm often accused of being an irrational fanboy but ""on disk DLC"" doesn't go far enough, bits don't weigh anything, 18650s do.

It means the user has to lug around batteries they can't use impacting the power to weight ratio.


This is one of those no so awesome things about Tesla.

Richard Stallman would say you don't really own your Tesla, I think he actually has, maybe google around, he says a lot of things.

/r/StallmanWasRight 

On the other hand the scheme allowed Tesla to offer their car at a lower price point when there were very few good electric car options out there.

In many ways buying electric is like buying a car and 9/10ths of the all the fuel it will ever use all up front, then saving in fuel costs until that price is made up. It's theoretically cheaper to own electric in the long run. So owning the Tesla could allow someone to afford the ""on disk DLC"". So it's more of an ""instant gratification tax"".


> using it undercuts the engineers 

This is a very emotive, but not very precise sentiment. Seems like you want to make this a fight.

One of the fundamental cornerstones to a free market is an informed market. Nobody is picking on any poor engineers, thinking about nuance of ownership in our world should be commended. Too many people click ""I Agree"" without even thinking about it.

""Do you really own your car or not?"" is a pretty important thing."

Why opt for a friendly advice when you can beat it into them? Think about it.
"Isn’t this assuming they needed three different cost ranges?  Why not just make the 75 cheaper? The difference in cost was $10,000 but they reduced the unlocking fee down to a few thousand now. Why not just lower the 75 price by $5000 and forget the paywall.

Are three price ranges required for Tesla?"
Tesla heavy-lift helicopter when?
"Ye that seems like a more reasonable thing to restrict. Kinda like if you buy an upgraded interior for a normal vehicle. Bluetooth radio connection, seat covering etc. "
"I don't think it is exactly the same thing : you can upgrade you car WHEN ITS READY. Here, the thing is already available. Just like when Capcom sold DLC costumes that were already on the disc on day one. It costs them nothing but... ""please pay more"". In your case, self-driving feature needs work so it makes sense to charge a fee. "

"Tesla's  60kwh cars built before supercharging was included as a part of the increased price of the car and before paid supercharging was possible can't pay for supercharging at all, they have to pay $2500 to enable free supercharging or they can't supercharge at any dollar value.  Enabling free supercharging also enables the ability to supercharge for these owners.   It does the same for 40kwh Teslas that can't supercharge *or* pay for supercharging - they have to pay to unlock 60kwh capacity and then again to enable supercharging.  There is no option for paid supercharging on old cars even now.

There are a lot of Teslas on the road that don't have the ability to fast charge at all, it wasn't always included in the price of purchase and that $2500 option (or $12500 for 40kwh cars) wasn't purchased by everyone.  "
Or less boost.
"Yes they do, rev limiters are only part of it.  Higher performance engine upgrades are often - and if you count hardware plus software almost always - software tweaks.  Tesla didn't invent the idea of ECU tuning for more horsepower, it was popular long before Tesla made people aware of chip tuning."
Tell that to the after market crowd as they spend millions increasing the HP of their cars.

He took $200 instead, because the engine is actually less durable, and gets slightly worse mileage, when the engine is tuned for performance."
"> It's not like anyone is intentionally giving their car less fuel economy or less power.

Yes they are.   Base car with Engine X gets the economy tune, less power more economy more durability lower price even though it's the same engine as the Performance version because the Performance option gets more power and less economy at the cost of lower durability and higher warranty cost.  A lot of people are willing to pay for more performance and less economy, it's a very profitable options group for many manufacturers - but not everyone.   More people choose more economy and less power, because not everyone is an auto enthusiast.  "
"Nope. Many of the same cars with higher trims get the same engine, but tuned differently and produce different numbers."
"A car model with more power will usually cost more, even if the only difference is how the ECU is set up. "

"Oh shit, that's pretty fucked up for a hardware company to limit the usability of its hardware via software unless you pay more."
"It does make sense what they do with the batteries. They could have different packs for 60, 75, 100 kwh, etc. But then they need manufacturing lines and different testing for each configuration. This way they only have to make two battery pack variations, and still offer a cheaper version of the car by software limiting the battery.

It seems like a shitty practice, but it wasn't originally this way. They changed to this method to cut costs. It also means you can get an upgrade for your car with a phone call, rather than a trip to the shop and a wait time to swap batteries.

It also has health benefits for the lower pack size, because each cell isn't pushed to the maximum, but rather 70-80%, making them last longer."
because it isn't intended and only for emergencies?
I am not a battery engineer and I think 60% of the sub is more knowledgeable about this than me but my impression with Li-ion batteries is that running the battery down too low is not good for it.  I think it's the sort of thing that makes a difference after many cycles but not so much just once or twice.

I'm not defending Tesla in this situation, just pointing out the laughably low estimate you have.

When I left for Katrina, it was hours at best and lines MILES long. Going down the highway a week later(after I realized I had nothing to go foward to) you'd see lines a mile long and people randomly out of gas on the side of the road. I always wonder what happened to those people"

"The idea is you wouldn't need to fill up at all. You should always be leaving your house with a ""full tank"". So you aren't typically waiting around for your car at all, it is charging while you are doing other stuff.

"I edited my post to clarify. No, that is false. No Tesla currently ships with a software limited pack. The three options for Model S are 75 kwh, 90 kwh, and 100 kwh. Model 3 has never shipped with a limited pack."

If you wanted a 75 kWh battery then you could have paid for it.   It doesn't sound horrible at all.  It gave the consumer more choice.   It allows you to upgrade later on if you choose to.   Plus there are benefits of a software locked battery.   Supercharging will appear to happen faster because of the lock.   And battery degradation will also be masked.   
"You do get to use all of it. The part that’s software locked isn’t the 75kwh, it’s extra on top of that. The battery is physically larger than 75kwh (for some vehicles) so for those they’re unlocking the rest of it that was software limited"
"The most expensive model (p100d) costs between 95,000 and 135,000 dollars depending on options. Everything else is below that. Even if we take 100,000 dollars, which is not indicative of the average price of a Tesla, what GM EV is better than a tesla for $20,000? 

As far as I'm aware, the only GM EV is the bolt, which has an MSRP of $38,000. If that's the one you're going with, how do you define that it is better than the P100D ($100,000 model). What categories does it beat a p100d?

"But I drive a Ford truck and already have 100% of my gas tank since the day I drove it off the lot. So if Ford called me and said that, I would just ""nah I'm good.""

"No, it isn't the same. The key difference in your example is that you're buying the software. If you pay more money, you can get the better software. This is fine. To make it a car example, you can pay this much for the v4 or if you want to go faster you can pay this much more for the v8.

Notice how that's different from buying a piece of hardware that is limited by software. Say I bought, for example, an iPhone (hardware). If I found out that the software was limiting the hardware like, say, [the battery](https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/apple-admits-iphone-slow-down/4179655.html), I would be angry (like all the people suing Apple).

If I'm buying the car (hardware) that is capable of charging quickly and storing a certain amount of energy, I should have access to everything that the hardware can do. Instead it is limited by what is basically ransomware."
"> There are lots of similar things. Manufacturers have put a soggy camshaft in a lower end version of a car, just to keep it from cannibalizing sales from the ""sport"" versions. The two engines cost the same to build, but one could produce up to 100 HP less due to the camera, physically restricted intake, and computer mapping.

Explain to me again how this example isn't greed based?

> The bottom line is simple... If you don't want something that's limited, don't buy it.

I'm not. My original question was more the along the lines of ""how the hell are people okay with this?"""
I read this but how much is it from like full to empty whatever that would entail. How high up do these batteries go?
"No.  Not even close. 

You don’t know what you’re taking about. 

Tesla made a battery pack, and realized some people didn’t want that much range (that big of a battery) and so considered making a smaller pack, but realized it was too much reengineering so they kept making the same battery pack, but in order to sell more said, “let’s sell the same car for cheaper but software limit the battery pack, so that the people who bought the bigger battery don’t feel ripped off, and maybe get more revenue later when people opt to unlock the bigger battery, but either way we still make some revenue on the car, just a little less on the software limited battery...”. 

this is just tesla saying if you bought the cheaper car, we’re going to make it act/charge like the more expensive car for the next several weeks,so you can get to safety.

"That’s not a fair comparison. Phones last longer, are easier to charge, and won’t leave you stuck on the side of the road in an emergency if you have a dead battery. They also cost a hell of a lot less money. You pay $60k for something, the whole thing should be yours to do whatever with. 

I agree with you that most people want a car that last 10 years. I disagree that it should be Tesla’s choice and not the owners to risk long term battery life. "
">	Say PS4 makes games generally available for $60. This lets you buy the game for $40 and later pay the extra $20 if you like the game enough to get the whole thing.

Yeah, that’s not how that works at all. Typically you pay the $60, then an additional $30 to get access to new products for your title that are not already made. When a developer attempts to charge you for “Extra” content that in fact already exists on the product you paid for, the community goes ape-shit, and rightfully so.

"Of course, of interesting note is that AMD *aren’t* doing that with their new chips. They’re built in two core segments that are then stitched together all the way up to 32 core server chips. It has the advantages of a simpler piece of silicon, and which means yield isn’t a problem for high core count CPUs, but at the cost of slightly slow cross talk between the cores that aren’t in the same pair - although that only happens in highly multithreaded situations where you are even doing that cross talk, and the firmware tries to minimise that by putting things that say they need to talk to each other on the same pair (and bear in mind each core runs two threads)

"So, ages ago I ran out of gas on my bike. State highway, 1:00AM.  I pushed the damn thing 4 miles to a 24hr gas station. As I'm filling it up, a guy at another pump says ""that sucks. Used the reserve too, huh?""

""Um, yeah... sure""

The most stupid I've felt in my entire life."
"I've heard a couple explanations for this:

One is that fuel level is measured mechanically rather than electronically.  It's essentially a lever with an air bulb attached to it that floats at the level of the gas in your tank. This bulb touches the bottom of your tank when there isn't enough fuel left to float it, thus reading ""empty"" before it actually is.

The other is that this is seen as beneficial because it's detrimental to fuel pumps to operate at low fuel levels. Encouraging a car owner to refill before they actually need to helps save wear and tear on this system.

Disclaimer: I don't actually know if either of the above are true."
"Except the guy wouldn’t need to go into the gas tank and remove the limit, he’d simply hook into the car computer and enable that spare gallon. There is no labor involved"
It would be like that if the express purpose of sealing off a portion of the gas tank was to have the full tank people subsidize the partial tank people in order to lower the minimum price of the car in order to increase market penetration 
">Prior to Irma’s landfall, Tesla announced that it would flip the proverbial switch, and allow the 60-kilowatt cars to become 75-kilowatt cars. This enabled the 60-kilowatt vehicles to go 230 miles per charge, rather than 200. “We hope that this allows you to travel to your next destination with confidence and ease,” Tesla wrote their Florida customers.

>Tesla was able to upgrade the kilowattage in the cheaper version of the car because both models actually have the same 75-kilowatt battery. The company just chooses to limit the capacity in some cars so they can have two different price points.

That previously was not the case. Dunno if they've changed the business model from 2016"
"I don't want to blow your mind, but you know how it seems like your gas gauge stays on F forever then drops like crazy?  Same thing, just in reverse..."
"Because economies of scale. They can't afford to sell all their batteries at a lower price, but they don't need to sell all of them at a higher price to break even.

You might be wondering then why Tesla wouldn't just make a cheaper version of their battery with less capacity? The reason is that it's actually cheaper for them to just crank out a shit ton of one thing rather than build the infrastructures for another thing.

They take a loss on the battery when they sell it cheaper but still make money on the car. They want to sell the cheaper car because there are some people who want to buy teslas but can't afford the more expensive one, and they can't make the cheaper car have the same performance as the more expensive one because then many people who would buy the more expensive one would then buy the cheaper one."
"The official reasoning is that they want a cheaper but more limited option to be available.

From a manufacturing standpoint, not having to create a 40kW battery line to be able to offer this option, and rather softlocking a 60kW battery, is more efficient."
"First of all. Throttle is 100% the wrong word for this.

Secondly, its is not awful. There is literally nothing bad about his. They aren't deceiving the customer, the customer is getting what they paid for. Tesla has used larger packs in ""smaller capacity"" cars a few times over the years. It was actually a really smart idea when it comes to simplifying productions lines. instead of making 3 or 4 different battery pack sizes, they make two and use software to limit them as needed. So the same pack is used in multiple models. This streamlines and quickens production. 

Also, for any car with a software limited battery pack, that battery pack will last longer before degrading as it is using a smaller percentage of its total capacity. Also, People who bought softlocked cars could at anytime, pay to upgrade their capacity if their needs changed or they just wanted more range."
"I wondered the same thing and I can’t seem to find an answer that makes sense to me. It could be that I’m missing an important detail about the difference between the variations of the models. 

What I’ve found is that they will put a 75kwh battery in all of the Model S, however you can buy a cheaper version of the Model S that is software locked to 70kwh. You can then purchase the software unlock at a later date for several thousand dollars. So the car has the same hardware and cost associated with assembling it, however they won’t let you use it without the unlock or buying the more expensive model from the start. "
"The battery lasts longer this way. The battery is 60kWh but you get access to 40kWh. After a year or so, the battery loses performance and is now only 55kWh, but it's still above 40kWh so you don't even notice.

That and extra money..."
there is also an option to have the battery unlocked later on. you can even bring the car into a service center and have the badges changed. 
"While Tesla is big on manufacturing, they don't make their products perfectly.  When your making a batch of power cells a few will end up being duds, not completely useless but flawed in some way to effect capacity.  Rather than toss it all together they can disable the flawed sections and sell it as a lower power rating. The same is done with solar cells and computer processors, and a lot of other products.  It's just Tesla's way of dealing with what might otherwise be a waste product."
"CPU and graphics cards do the same thing.  You used to be able to use a lead pencil to unlock additional power by bridging some connections or patching the card to think it is a higher model.  And no, this isn't the same thing as binning.

If they know people won't pay the higher price but they can still profit off a lower one, they will sell two versions even though it is the same chip."
"Allows you to gouge a bit at the top end , they probably figured out most people wouldn't need/want to pay for a full 80, found a way to make them at a certain price and get the top customers to subsidize the ones below.

Or something. That's a totally made up scenario."
It's also cheaper for them than making a bunch of different battery sizes

"The weight of the 18650s isn't really relevant IMO. 

The customer is paying for a car, not just its parts. As such they are paying for the expertise to make it, for the supply chain, and for the performance it offers. Talking about the individual parts, and whether it has X or Y batteries, disregards the larger picture. 

The 40kWh battery was advertised for a price that it would take to produce such a battery pack en masse. However, due to a much smaller order volume than expected for that battery size, there was not enough money in orders to justify spinning up a separate production line. To the extent that, if someone actually wanted a 40kWh battery with exactly that number of cells, they'd be paying as much as if they had ordered a 60kWh battery. Production lines aren't cheap. 

So what's the solution? Make the 40kWh people pay that extra $10k or whatever? That's not fair to them, they wanted a cheaper option. Give them the 60kWh battery for the price of the 40? That's not fair to the people who paid more for the 60. 

The fact of the matter is the people who ordered a 40 paid for the specs and performance of a 40. This includes the curb weight *which was calculated using the 60kWh battery*. Giving them a software limited pack is literally fulfilling what they paid for. 

Arguing that extra cells take up extra weight is like saying that tesla should have used steel instead of aluminum because steel would be cheaper. Or that they didn't need as many airbags or as strong of a structure because 4 star crash safety is enough. In the end, tesla is the one making the product and as such they dictate the specs and features of their product. You can't force them to make something a certain way. If people only would buy a ""true"" 40kWh pack, then tesla simply wouldn't build it. It's not profitable for them. And in the end, consumer goodwill doesn't pay the bills. 

Edit: also, you seem to be under the impression that the extra 20kWh negatively affects the power to weight ratio of the performance. The extra batteries actually *increase* the available power because they are wired in series and thus provide more voltage to the motor. That is why the original base 85kWh model has a better acceleration than the base 60kWh model, despite using the same motor. Similarly the 40kWh model would have had a lower series voltage and would have had comparably worse performance. "
"It's not fucking over the consumer in any way.

It's a solution to a problem.

The problem is that when batteries are fully charged, or fully discharged, it's massively damaging to the battery.

The solution is to not let you fully charge or discharge the battery.

This results in your batteries working for much longer.

Your phone does exactly the same thing.

The added benefit (if you could call it that) is that you can choose to ""unlock"" the ability to use more of the battery, but that's actually more taxing on the battery, and while you'll be able to drive for longer on a single charge, the battery will actually be ""good"" for fewer total driven miles.

If you don't want that, don't pay for it. "
At first I assumed you were an idiot but then I checked your other comments and I was sure of it.
"What if the alternative is that Tesla only offers the large capacity battery, and everyone has to pay for the highest model? It is very likely that producing a second, smaller battery would not be worth having a cheaper model.  

Some people do not need the long range battery, and would only be paying more for the same usage of the car."
"Offering a model for cheaper by using the same specs but just limiting the battery capacity is fucking over the consumer? What the fuck?

NOT offering a cheaper model because it's not financially viable to create a separate 40 kWh battery for the smaller demand would fuck over the consumer.

There is literally nothing evil or sinister about Tesla selling a cheaper model with a limited battery. "
Pretty sure the battery is the expensive part. 
You’re not thinking about it logically. You bought the cheaper version of the car with the smaller battery and you’d expect that to be it but oh wait. You’re given the option to upgrade it at anytime if you want. Usually you wouldn’t even have that option and you’d just be stuck with the smaller battery and this is all at the same price. Plus Tesla is an emerging electric car company in one of the most competitive industries in the world you can’t blame them for not making their cars as cheap as they possibly can be PLUS it’s a luxury car. If you want the economic value get the model 3
So i should be able to put AAs in my phone or my Tesla? Do you have any clue how batteries work? 
So if right before they shipped the cars they took out the batteries and threw them in the trash would it be ok?
Nobody's forcing you to buy the car. If you don't like the practice don't pay for it

"Selling the s60s for $10,000 less resulted in a loss on the cost of the battery, but a gain overall in more products sold. 

The s75 was sold at the price you'd expect for a 75kWh battery. The s60 was sold at the price you'd expect for a 60kWh battery, even if the 60kWh battery was actually a limited 75kWh battery.

Selling one model priced in between would result in Tesla losing revenue from everyone who bought or would have bought the full 75kWh model for $5000 more, while also not selling as many models in total since that $5000 increase compared to the s60 model would result in many that bought that model not being able to afford or not being willing to spend more on a more expensive model.

So not only does this method result in more revenue for Tesla, it also results in a more affordable model being provided for the masses, while simplifying the production process for Tesla."

How would you even break something with over clocking at all? your question makes no sense
Yes they do happen.   That is why you keep a reasonable amount of charge/gas in the car.   Plus even if this was an option that you could unlock the battery you would still have to charge the car fully.  It isn't like you hit a button and you get the extra capacity with a 100 percent charge.  In the case of an evacuation it makes a great deal a sense.   For almost any other emergency you wouldn't have the time to sit there and do a full charge so the ability to unlock quickly for a local emergency is going to be useless in most cases.  
"It also helps mitigate any PR problems. It would be a nightmare for tesla if someone died because their car didn't have enough range, or couldn't supercharge for some reason. This is an easy way for them to mitigate this PR problem while also coming across as altruistic.   

It's a win win for tesla and the owners."
Id say being able to go from an empty battery to a full one in 30 minutes would be a pretty big help compared to other charge options that can take anywhere up to a full day to charge to capacity.  
I just dont see what kind of a reason Tesla could have for discriminating people like that and not have their stock or the company be negatively affected..
Right... so it’s unlikely that Model 3s were excluded.  (But not all S and X have free supercharging).

"I know it seems like it’s similar, but that’s not for engine durability specifically. Above a very specific RPM valve float and piston rod plasticity cause immediate catastrophic engine failure. On a new V6 with OHV design, that can be as low as 7200RPMs. As the engine ages, the valve springs weaken, and rods yield, that number can be much lower, even below the rev limiter on engines with a lot of miles. 

That’s not the same thing as holding out capacity to achieve more charges. A closer analog would be changing oil at 3k miles to improve long term reliability vs 5-8k miles for convenience — something the owner has complete control over. "

More like deciding what options you want with your car when you buy it. This is the company giving their customers a free temporary upgrade because the boss is coming to town.
"You have a point but this quite prevalent in electronics really. Many CPUs are software or hardware locked to slower rates. It's just cheaper to make them all the same and then allow the customer to decide what performance level they want to pay for. 

Back to Tesla, I only know of the S60 and the really old S40 which were software locked for a short period of time. I don't believe any of the current MS or MX are software locked at all. The software locking allowed people to buy MS at a discounted rate and it probably helped those with short commutes. "
You pay less for the vehicle and can choose to upgrade at any time.
This was done for a very short period of time when they didn't want to make two different sizes of batteries.   They software locked the larger one if all you wanted was the smaller battery.   There is some benefits to a software locked battery.   Supercharging will appear to be faster because there is a section of the battery at the top that isn't used.   Also battery degradation will be masked because of this locked section.   It isn't like the person buying the car didn't know the battery was software locked.  Plus it gives them the user to unlock it if they choose to.   
Ever heard of intel?
What? No it isn't. They did the consumer a favor by lowering the purchase price. They could have just only offered the higher price and never offered the lower cost option. 
Ever heard of intel?
"Nah, its intended, you just have to pay more to have that extra storage unlocked usually. its kind of shitty, but its a way for them to produce two models with the same parts. "
I believe they're just lifting the locked capacity of lower end models. IIRC S60 models came with a S75 battery pack with a software lock on the battery capacity. That lock was undone temporarily the last time tesla did this.

Is that not already a thing? Seems like uncrippling your Tesla would be a good reason to hack the firmware. 
"sounds like you paid for a v8, because thats what they gave you. so you're either over paying for a v6, or wayyyy over paying for a v8. "
"No, you are getting a V8 in a car that has a V8. Youre just not allowed to use it fully due to an artificial paywall. If it literally didnt come with that additional hardware and needed it added after the fact to have additional capacity, then thats one thing, but to actually have everything you physically need to do something and not being able to due to a manufactured artificial limit kinda sucks. "
"no, that just tells me that they're overcharging for their v8's. "
"Southern California, Victoria Gardens/Rancho Cucamonga supercharger. Always packed (probably because I assume locals abuse it) 

Also if that’s the case someone topped off on gas will be ready to go to, making the whole thing just a silly argument. Some people can/will be screwed with a tesla and some can and will with any regular car"
"That's fair, I think regardless of what you drive you're going to be alright if you're planning ahead. I think the real point I'm trying to get at is I would much rather be caught in a pinch with the gas powered car."
"With that kind of pessimism you'll always be disappointed, even when you're not."
"And Tesla's software has far less vulnerabilities than any other major automakers. 

[DEF CON 23 - 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX_0c9R4Fng)"
Lol!!! that’s not how that works.  Most people actually remove the rev limiter (you call it the red line) from their automatic cars when they’re attempting to get more performance from them. 
This isn't a conversation for reddit. It's a business supply chain discussion and the dumb will always win out against nuance.
"And what kind of choice are you talking about?

If I wanted more choice, then I could buy a car that actually has a 60kwh battery and only pay for that amount of material instead of one that has a 75kwh battery but won't let me use what I paid for.

"
"So basically you're justifying misinformation of a regular consumer and sending a software patch with some bullshit ""const battery = 75"" patch to be worth paying an extra 5 grand?

The battery does degenerate, and supercharging is the same speed it just won't take as long as if you charged all 75"
"The spark. Based on reliability alone. 

Once Tesla finishes developing infrastructure, GM is gonna put them out of business overnight"
So you agree. Most non tesla Evs are better tham Tesla
"Like I said, it's all relative. You're probably rich compared to someone living in poverty. Someone living in poverty is rich compared to someone living in a hut in Africa. "
"All newer Tesla’s can be supercharged, some have it free and others have to pay (depending on the model and the use of referral codes).

Some of the older Tesla’s were sold with supercharger access as an option. Either you paid up front for access or you couldn’t use the super chargers. They don’t have the ability to pay for on-demand supercharger use.

What Tesla has done is made sure that *all* cars in the affected areas can get supercharger access and not have to pay for it."
"There's no ""extra"" payment. You're paying for the cost of electricity and facilities when you use a supercharger station, just as you pay the cost of gas and facilities to fill up a traditional car at a gas station."
Like gas someone has to pay for the electricity.   On most Early model S and X's the cost to supercharge was buried into the cost of the.   Now with the Model 3 you have to pay for charging.   Both the supercharger locations and electricity are not free.  Tesla or the consumer has to pay for it.   
You do have 100% of the battery. Stop talking out of your ass.
"Your smartphone battery only charges to about 85% technically inside. Ever. Why? Because your smartphone battery lasts 3 times as many charge cycles by only being between 10% and 95% between 3.0 and 4.2 volts. Smartphone companies COULD give you 100%, but the batteries would last 4 months then need replacing, because wear on the battery is exponential. And Tesla actually uses about 68% of their ACTUAL capacity. Their 75KWH battery is even higher than that. They limit it even more than that, so like 85% of the 68%, but that's purely because they can save 50% on warranty repairs for that category, so they can pass those savings since it's much more reliable. 

Tesla would rather you drive 200 miles 5000 times instead of 400 miles 100 times. "
"If Ford said we’re going to give you a bigger gas tank that you didn’t pay for, but use it if you need to, if not don’t, oh and by the way fill it up on us, you wouldn’t say...  wow that’s pretty cool of them?  "
"Hahaha!

Don't worry, Tesla won't come after you, they'll just don't allow your car to access their network."
"They have less maintnence, wear and tear, charge repairs, warrenty replacements on cells, and dead battery cells can be compensated for. "

"The typical EV owner will charge at home as the primary location, not out and about. I've only had to use a public charger once when I drove pretty far away. You just plug it in each night and unplug in the morning. You typically aren't waiting around for it to charge. "
No all.   Originally the free supercharging for life was an option that you had to pay for.   Then later they just included the cost in the price of the car.   So there could be early Model S's that don't have free supercharging.   
"Yes it would. It would cost them more in maintnence and warranty work later. It only cost Apple $4 to make a 256gb phone over a 64gb one, but they charge hundreds more. Why? Because the base phone doenst turn a profit, but now they have a cheaper phone."
"Some you have to pay for, some are free.  Whole Foods has chargers at a lot of their stores that are 100% free. "
"Yes...  but the increased range has nothing to do with that...  they are giving those drivers something they didn’t pay for...  what other manufacturer does that...  


It’s like ford saying that car you bought several years ago actually has a bigger tank you didn’t pay for, we’re going to open it up and let you put more gas in your car for the next few weeks, even though it’s not something you paid for. "
most software programs already have the pro options built in. The public just has to pay to get a code to unlock it.
"It isn't about greed in some cases.  An engine can't easily be upgraded.  Computer programming can.  If they aren't using it to get more money out of you, it's not greed based.  If they are allowing you to pay back the price difference, or even less than the difference, to obtain full features, it is a service to the customer in allowing them to afford something they otherwise couldn't."
"Depending on where you live (cost of electricty there, and how much you drive) you're looking at $20-$60 per month in electricity usage."
Depends on what sized battery you have.   Tesla has made cars with 40 to 100 kWh batteries.   The Model 3 Long range currently has a 75 kWh battery and gives you a 310 mile range.   The Model S currently can come with a 75 or 100 kWh battery.   That will give you 259 or 335 miles of Range.   A model 3 can do a 0-80 percent charge in around 40 minutes at a supercharger.   After 80 percent the charge speed tapers to the point it is not really worth doing especially if you are paying by the minute.   
Tesla does limit the packs substantially in the cheaper cars to create the effect of having a smaller battery; But they also limit the batteries to less than their full potential even in the full priced cars due to the reasons I stated above. It is incredibly damaging to charge a lithium battery to 100% its theoretical limit or discharge it past ~20%
"> Yeah, that’s not how that works at all. Typically you pay the $60, then an additional $30 to get access to new products for your title that are not already made.

You missed the point. I was talking about the game analog for what's occurring with Tesla."
All EVs will have some capacity that you can't access at the top and bottom of the battery.   That is there to protect the battery.   How much depends on the battery and how big it is.  But it usually isn't a massive amount.   But in the case of Tesla unlocking the capacity this isn't for that.   This is the specific case where they had some batteries that were 75 kWh but were sold as software locked 60 an 70 kWh batteries.   They don't make batteries like that any longer and was offered for a short time to simplify manufacturing so they didn't have to make 4 different pack sizes.  
"I think you might have read that backwards, as in the i7e were binned to be i3s (uncommon though it may be)"
Other way round. The i7 got binned down to i3 since it was way below specs. But that is way less likely. And there were two core i7s two years ago. Look up the i7 6600u.
"No, the previous poster is missing a lot of details. 

Chips often have issues that limit performance, so if a core or two are non-functional, it’s better for the manufacturing to limit the product to match the lower spec offering. 

TL;DR: Quality control catches a lot of “bad” components. Rather than scrapping them, you can typically use them in a lesser application without issue.  Nothing to get angry about, considering the product you purchased performs as you would expect it to."
"Wow that actually makes a lot more sense lmao, idk where I got downloadable content for DLC, thanks"
"You could start using a Fleet of Teslas as your energy source, and charge them at a distributed network of energy stations. No more being scuppered by the power companies wondering why you're using as much energy in an hour as the whole street does in a week. "
"you need to move the bounce house into the grow op!  Or hear me out, move the grow op into the bounce house!"
Solar roof. 
"That makes a lot of sense.

By charging the battery, you're essentially ""absorbing"" 100% of the generator output until fully charged. If you hook the house up directly, you'll essentially be throwing away whatever energy isn't used in that very moment.

Good thinking! "
"I may be wrong, that was from a owner's forum [here](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/voltage-of-model-s-motors.50391/). Battery voltage is going to be *variable,* a Li-Ion cell loses voltage as it discharges, 400V seems to be the voltage at full charge. That 320V is the AC *root mean square* voltage - meaning it peaks around 355, and if the battery pack's voltage wasn't high enough to cover that plus conversion losses, now you have to raise the voltage and complicating your whole setup (losing even more power in the process)."
"Ah, you’re right, but you probably know why I was mistaken cuz most people call it 220v, lol.

And actually here, I think people would be wanting their full 240v 200A service, it’s not just a 12v SLA in that car, it can take the full load no problem!

Interesting that it’s only a +-5% tolerance. My genset doesn’t kick in until it’s <88% nominal for 5 seconds.  "
"Ah, you're right and that was a silly mistake (and even then it was like ""watt? oh... coulombs per second""). 

Thermal efficiency losses. So to clear it up, the maximum power output of the motor is 300hp, but while it's there It's gonna need 745kW of chemical energy being converted at any given time."
Vehicle to Grid is probably going to become a topic of serious discussion once everybody's garage has a big battery on wheels.  
"See: Tesla's bullshit ""mission statement"" or whatever it's called. 

And your car isn't very fast either. I've got a 30 year old car with a higher top speed. Your car isn't fast, it's quick. And only from start or at lower speeds.. and only for how long? How long does it takes to warn your battery up to do a launch start, and then how quickly does begin to overheat and need to be cooled down?"
"> I know fossil fuels are subsidized

Fossil fuels are subsidized because of their strategic importance from a military perspective, so if the world suddenly fell under one jurisdiction those would go away, that is not the same for renewables...also 400B worldwide for an industry with 5+ trilions in sales doesn't seem that much.

> What subsidies"" for EVs are you kludgily trying to bring up so you can whine about them anyway? I know fossil fuels are subsidized, but I don't know of any EV specific subsidies (at least in my country, the USA).

"Oh wow. I guess you were new to motorcycles?

ATVs usually have reserve switches too."
"Had a motorcycle that was new to me, but about 10 years old.

Ran out of gas in the middle of the afternoon, full gear, in the summer, in Alabama. It was hot. Turned the valve to reserve...nothing. Turns out something was wrong with the petcock and it used all the fuel, reserve included, even when set to normal.

I pushed that thing 2 miles down the road, went to fuel up and realized I had forgotten my wallet. I had to beg the attendant to let me just put $2 in it to get to my house and back."
"Mostly just mechanical inaccuracy with a side of human psychology on the side. You're actually not supposed to drive most cars on less than 1/4 tank because the gas cools the pump as you've said, but they also know most people don't really do that so they build the pumps to last longer anyways."
"The fuel pump is cooled by the fuel it pumps, so it will overheat and possibly burn out if there is no fuel."
"I know, but that's unrealistic for the gasoline car's equivalent of the analogy so I was just going with what would work as an example. Since the whole gasoline system is more of a physical thing I figured I'd just make it a physical barrier that needs to be removed"

"/u/downfallmatrix and I have both given responses that answer your question.

Its really not complex."
"Hard drives come with a little ""extra"" space that is used when blocks of the old space start failing. Same scenario here. People who unlock that extra battery space get more capacity but also need to service the battery more often. "
"Yup. It's called price discrimination and though it sounds bad it's pretty much the most common sales technique in the book. Imo as long as people aren't expecting a bigger battery capacity and get blind sided by a smaller one this is totally fine.

"
It's also really really wrong.
"If you do actually fully discharge a lithium cell, you cause irreversible damage. You may be able to force it to charge back up again (most chargers won't let you do this), and it may work fine afterwards. Or it may catastrophically fail. For that reason, it's highly recommended not to deep discharge a li-ion battery. 

For a pack of cells the situation is actually much worse. Due to tiny variations in construction, some of the batteries will run out before other batteries, and they'll get charged *in reverse*, thus totally fucking up their chemistry and construction. "
"You can't fully discharge a Tesla, even these software locked Teslas will shut down at ""0%"" with about 5kwh remaining unused as ""brick protection"" and it would probably take a year or more of sitting at that 0% for the battery to drain enough to be permanently unusable."
"And from your comments, all you do is talk about money.  Basic bitch."
"This is the alternative, there's no ""what if"" about it"
It's all the same battery. They're charging you more to access something you've already paid for.
"Oh my God. All the cars use the same fucking battery, they charge you more money to get more usage out of the battery. It's like someone taking away your drink when you're 3/4 done and saying you need to pay an extra $1.50 to finish it."

Would probably help with battery life as well.
Except any apple phone or almost any other phone made in the last 5 years. On my galaxy i would need to perform surgery in order to replace the battery. A decade ago phones had detachable batteries that were easy to remove.
"Because overclocking increases heat production resulting in faster wear of the cpu, no?

Also more frequent crashes are cited as well. It would really depend on the semantics applied to breaking here but I think I would consider both of those “breaks” 

My question was in response to what you said;”They don’t take any damage if you keep temperatures low enough”

So what is described as low enough? 

I do think what you are saying a misnomer, overclocking can create damage and is not without risks.

Overclocking can indeed break your cpu and wear down your machine faster, but a typical slight overclock of 5-15% is generally accepted. Or am I wrong?"
There is no reason but that doesn't mean we should expect this behavior by default.
Yep

I think if you live in certain parts of the country they are superior. I live in a mid-sized urban center but commute from a university and I have to say there are not even close to enough supercharger stations to fulfill demand. How long does it take for a tesla to charge off a normal 110v socket?

Yes thank you for rephrasing what I said.
I could just as easily apply a better fuel economy tune to my vehicle as I could a better power output tune. It's done every day in the diesel tuning world. And it's done in the ICE world with manufacturers who use the same engine in different model vehicles and tune it for the performance characteristics of the consumer it's meant for.
"Both vehicles have been limited for various reasons, fuel economy, parts reliability, safety, costs. "
">But they're making mechanical changes to the car. 

Not always true. You can chip a 1 series for a substantial HP increase. Nothing else needed. I know because I've done it.  "
How is that different than what Tesla is doing with the battery and mapping of electrical power to the motors?
[deleted]
"no one is arguing or not understanding that, I was just saying it is nice that Tesla would do this for its owners...."
It’s still the same thing. Also engine optimization does offer different performance. Saw it multiple times before buying my S when I was looking at other cars. Many manufacturers do this. Software flashing can make a huge difference. That’s why companies like Dinan exist.
so tesla is the EA of cars?
Wasn't there also a 70 kWh battery that was a software locked 75?
"I have not heard the relevant story about intel, no."
"The reverse:  Tesla can profitably and sustainably sell the hardware at the purchase price, but would rather let it remain unusable to it's full potential than let you access it for free.

I get that it probably makes business sense and that it's transparent and customers are fine with it, but let's be real here: if Ford made 350 hp cars that couldn't top 250 without paying extra to change the fuel-injection software, the front page of reddit would be full of complaints about it."
How is it shitty? People got exactly what they paid for.
"How much of a percentage of total battery is locked behind this ""extra storage"" exactly?"
It's a car. Of course they are. Do you expect Tesla to sell at cost?
"It’s not overcharging if people pay for it, that’s how the market works.

DC charging?   Spark doesn't even have DC charging yet vs supercharging.  Availability?  I can order a tesla now, and the Chevy site doesn't even list the spark ev for me. 

But it's more reliable?  Any stats to back that up?  Anything to show how reliable the spark ev is?  I honestly didn't even know it existed, and I doubt they have made enough to have any kind of sample size."
"With a compelling argument such as yours, how could anyone not?"
"Cheaper != Better

Now yes, cheaper can mean more ideal for some people or certain situations, but it absolutely does not mean the car is objectively 'better'.

The BMW I3 in particular highlights this. It's only about 10% cheaper than a base Model 3 LR, yet has barely a third of the range.

It also has worse performance, worse cargo/passenger space, and has access to far fewer fast chargers, meaning it typically takes a lot longer to charge.

The leaf is probably the best car mentioned so far, but even it loses to the model 3 on a $/range basis, and shares the aforementioned drawbacks of the I3.

Which isn't to say that the leaf is a bad car, not at all. For the market it's aimed at it's a pretty good car, but it's not a 'better car' than the 3."
Yea I know that’s why I said nobody who owns a Tesla is in the situation where free charging means survival!
"Got it, thank you! "

How much more is your electricity bill?
"True, not all Model S had free supercharging. But all software capacity limited packs had free supercharging afaik? "
"The increased range *does* involve draining the battery further than you normally would, which apparently degrades the battery life. My understanding is that this is *why* the cars won't normally let you use that full capacity—because the batteries won't last as long in the future.

I don't know a lot about battery technology, but I was always told that it's better to recharge your li-ion batteries before they drain completely, because completely draining them negatively affects their overall life.

So I think this kind of risk should be explained alongside temporary suspension of a safety feature. Yeah, it's only the safety of the car itself, but Teslas are expensive.

"
"I understand how that works in your video recorder example, but I'm not getting it with the car. I could see people paying more for the fast charging feature in the case that Tesla has to license that technology, but that seems less likely to me in the battery capacity case.

I don't really know how much battery IP Tesla owns vs. what they license."

"This is incredibly educational, thank you!  The charge curve actually maps to my observed horsepower decreases I've noticed with SOC drop also."
"The spec I listed is for the national grid (4 sub grids of that are east, west, texas, and part of canada). So the +-5% is for the grid not the Tesla equipment.

Gensets are lazy to kick in because it's really hard for a diesel unit to start and stop if the power fluctuates but doesn't go out.

But something like a powerwall/powerpack thats digitally controlled can respond in milliseconds and will cut in way closer to nominal voltages. Nothing in the specs https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/powerwall/Powerwall%202_AC_Datasheet_en_northamerica.pdf show anything but the nominal voltage so I can't say for sure what voltage triggers it for a brownout/blackout. It might be 0.5v below nominal or it might be some arbitrary number well below the official 5% grid spec but still likely higher than your genset.

Table 14. Electrical Input and Output

* Nominal Input Voltage: 200–240 Vac or 100/200, 110/220, 120/208, 120/240, 127/220
* Input Voltage Range: Vac 176–276 Vac*
* Nominal Output Voltage: 200–240 Vac or 100/200, 110/220, 120/208, 120/240, 127/220 Vac
* Nominal Frequency: Online: 50/60 Hz auto-sensing; output frequency tracks input frequency to selectable limit (±0.1 to ±5.0 Hz; ±3.0 Hz default); switches to battery operation outside this tolerance. On battery: 50 Hz or 60 Hz ±0.1 Hz
* Voltage Waveform: Sine wave; <3% THD at rated linear loads, computer-grade power
* Overload Capability: 150% for 10 seconds; 300% for 12 cycles
* DC Input protection: DC fuse and battery charger overvoltage limit network
* Output Protection: Microprocessor-sensed overvoltage and overcurrent, with fuse backup

So in the US the wall would be configured to 120v/240v and would switch based on whatever software rule they set. Until I hear otherwise I'll assume something close to the +-5% the grid goes by."

""How quickly does it begin to overheat and need to be cooled down?""  5 years and counting.  I think you read an article about oveheating from 2012  and forgot that Tesla has updated their software and retroactively  increased the battery warranty since then.  they used to worry that the battery would fail at 100,000 miles and had restrictive thermal protections in place, since then they've learned the batteries can last a million miles and relaxed their thermal restrictions.

"Electrical capacity is measured in kWh as a unit, ""kwh"" is sort of like ""gallons"" for gasoline units.    Tesla sells big batteries with 100 kWh capacity and the average house uses 20kwh per day of electricity soa Tesla 100 kwh battery can power a 20 kwh / day home for 5 straight days (100 / 20 = 5).  

Headlights use much less power than your entire house so they last a lot longer - googling this an average headlight uses 65 watts (Tesla's LEDs should use less but I can't find that number so lets go with old fashioned lights), so 2 headlights uses 130 watts.  Converting to kilowatts we get 0.13kW.   If we want to calculate that into how long that will last we need to know kwh, so 0.13kW into 100kwh = 769 hours or just over 32 days of continuously powered headlights.

EVs use really big batteries, even the cheapest lowest range EV can power your entire house for at least a big chunk of a day.  This should really put into perspective how colossal the energy requirements are for driving down the highway for a few hours really are - You can either drive for 5 hours and go 300 miles or power your whole neighborhood for 5 hours.

I fuckin knew heroin made you immortal. Where've you been?
"Sadly no, I knew full well about it but just somehow in the frustration of running out of gas it never crossed my mind. Brain dead. No excuse."
Just gotta remember to flip it to off after filling up or next time you run out the reserve is already gone too. Done that once or twice
Not really. You could just have a switch installed on the float in the gas tank and tell the PCM to cut the fuel pump when it reaches a set level. Then you could unlock that portion of the tank by hooking up to the car and telling the PCM to allow it.
I thought the i5 was just an i7 with locked cores?
"Tesla's pretty good when it comes to their software, but that's a good question. I'd be surprised if it couldn't be hacked by *anyone*."
Im assuming you could but you'll be put into some blacklist that prevents you from getting any service from them in the future.
"It’s probably possible, but nobody would do it because of losing software updates "
Good on ya
"Exactly. 

Totally different story when it's advertised as X and then blindsided or lied to. NVidias GTX 970 debacle comes to mind. 

Edit: and people are downvoting me for explaining things. People are so incredibly stupid and petty. shooting the messenger."
"I'm not even commenting on the ethics of it, it's everywhere in almost every industry to create tiers of product."
"Oh, good to know. I could certainly use some."
It’s not the same battery this is only in one specific car the s60. It had the 75 kwh battery but was limited to 60 for longevity purposes and they temporarily boosted it up to the s75 software which isn’t good for the battery but is good for running away from a hurricane. 
"You understand that people paid less for the S60 than they did for the S75, right? You get that they actually did not pay for it?

You also grasp the concept of high volume production being cheaper?

Please. "
"Why are you only responding to the people who aren't explaining this concept correctly. You're both very, very wrong"
Because you didn't pay for the whole drink... 
"Yeah. Because you paid for 3/4th of the drink. Come on, this isn't difficult to understand. "
"No — the ‘you’re not entitled to anything at all out of other people’ approach. 

You are not entitled to internet service. You are not entitled to be kept alive by other people, except to a minimal extent (which you’re doing an excellent job of militating against). You are not entitled to snake oil. You’re certainly not entitled to an electric car. "
"Just to clarify, they are still making a profit on the car overall. Just less profit than they make on the s75.

Based on the economy of scales, they actually profit more from using the ""more expensive"" battery in the s60 rather than producing another completely different battery.

This whole thing is really a Win-Win, but some people can't seem to understand that"
"NSA probably said bad guys just take out their batteries when doing bad shit so now embed the battery so we can always listen even if your phone is ""off"""

"You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole."
"what? If you want to stretch your definition of ""damaging your cpu"" to ""crashing the computer"" then sure. Overclocking can damage your computer. 
"
good point 
Right. It would be really cool to see the actual numbers. 
"Doesn't Tesla limit its battery capacity due to the way batteries work? You're not supposed to take a battery from 100% to 0%, that'll damage the battery. For longer lasting life, you charge it up to around 80% then down to around 20%, and claim that is ""0 to 100"" in order to protect the battery. But in case of emergency, you gain that extra 20-40% so you can evacuate. Once or twice shouldn't have that major of an impact on the battery. That is a technological limitation, not a selling point."
"The cars are ""crippled"" because they sold smaller capacity batteries **at a substantially lower cost** than higher capacity models.  For production efficiency they used larger capacity batteries in some models and limited them with software.  It's not like they crippled features that ""should have come with the car for free."""
Giving someone something they didn't pay for in order to help them in a time of need is pretty much the definition of altruistic.
"> How long does it take for a tesla to charge off a normal 110v socket?

Depends on your battery size and much charge you need to add, but the answer is going to be a very long time. Over a day in many cases."
You’re right.  Companies have indeed started shipping incomplete software because of how easily it can be updated later.  It is a clear downside to the technology.  I’m a bit “old fashioned” too and I hear you.  The technology isn’t the problem though.  It’s short-sighted execs that abuse the technology.
"I never got the feeling that you were criticizing Tesla. I completely understand that it’s not a very big cost to them, and I think it is very important to not form a cultish circle-jerk. Reminding people that Tesla is not perfect, or just not as god-like as people make out sometimes is important. 

That being said, I still stand by my original statement. 
>the important thing is that they are giving out FREE SUPERCHARGING. 

I stand by this because I think the free supercharging is an important gesture. Even if it didn’t cost anything. Tesla is essentially doing what little it can to help people who are in danger. And that means a lot.  Tesla is a company that works hard for its customers, rather than to make money from its customers. 

I don’t really care if this is because of how the company operates, because of musk, or because Tesla is just trying to improve its PR. Either way, I trust Tesla more than most companies. (But not when it comes to timely ness.) "
They also have environmental regulations to abide by. 
"Easily, maybe. A reprogrammer that isn't VIN restricted costs several hundred dollars."
"i know you're not the parent comment but, car companies don't sell gas. They just sell cars. Tesla is a car company and a ""gas station"" which is why they are able to give free ""fuel"" out. "
"It's nice of Tesla to do, no doubt about that. 

However there's numerous people acting like they're so special because other manufacturers haven't done the same. It's *far* easier to hand out free ""fuel"" when you directly own the stations and have control over the vehicles using said stations. 

Your remark about it being $15 more than any other manufacturer has given out isn't fair. No other manufacturer has the same direct, easy access to do such a thing."
[deleted]
they let their customers know before hand and it made the model s affordable for those who bought it. If customers at a later stage want to use the full battery than they can just pay for the last bit of storage that is on their battery. So not really comparable with EA who just screw people over at all times. 
"Maybe. Although the EA equivalent would be being able to buy a game without multiplayer for a cheaper price. The S60 comes with a 75kWh battery pack but is cheaper than the S75. You can always upgrade later, but will pay more than what you would’ve paid at delivery. Do you consider EAP and FSD to be DLC? Depends on how you look at it. "
Yes! I forgot about that one
"They (and AMD) used to make processors (and probably still do) that used exactly the same die, and then limit its power either by severing connections after manufacturing or with a firmware lock. So you'd have a CPU that was technically capable of much better performance but had parts disabled.

Having a hard time finding a reference because search results have been flooded by Intel's 'AMD Crippling' in their compilers."
"Technically, you have cars (specifically turbocharged cars) that can make potentially more horsepower for something as simple as a ECU software reflash to increase boost. Some manufacturers will offer it as a ""performance package"" or whatever. Why didn't they just give you that for free? This is a very common thing. It's an option for people that wanna pay more. Alternatively, if you don't care for the extra power or KWH battery, you can pay less."
The margins on a car that was bought with a software locked battery would be lower though.   Tesla is paying the extra manufacturing costs on the battery even though it isn't being paid for at purchase.   The idea is that at some point the owner my choose to pay to unlock or if the car is a lease and when it comes back Tesla can unlock it and sell it with the larger battery.   I don't get how this is a bad thing.   At the time it gave the consumer more choice and allowed them to choose how much they wanted to pay and the battery size they wanted.   
It is profitable for them to sell *some* cars at that price. Probably not all of them though. 
"There are plenty of cars that are performance-limited.

Let's take ""if Tesla can sustainability sell the hardware at x price"" to its logical conclusion: Tesla should be selling everything at cost. They ain't a charity."
Except they don't have to rely on the fact that it would be profitable at the lower purchase price.  I would guess 80-90% of those software locked batteries will be upgraded before the end of the vehicles life.
"If ford sold two cars, one $5,000 cheaper that had a lower hp, people would have no problem with that"
you paid for a 75w battery. because thats what you receieved. but you're only allowed to use 65w of its capacity and must pay more to use the rest.  its pretty shitty when you think about it. but im on r/teslamotors so i wouldn't expect anyone here to understand. 
"I don't have an answer for that. I just remember that they did something similar last year and it came up that if you have say a 65w, you actually have the same battery thats in a 75w but they software lock it at 65. "
About 20% in a 75-locked-to-60.
I am pretty sure the batteries were all 75kWh.   You could have then paid for only a 60kWh or 70kWh battery. 
"For a short period of time, Tesla sold the model S60 with a battery that was 75kWh software locked.  So, about an extra 25%, but only for those limited vehicles."
20 kwh on a software locked 40kwh car.  10 kwh on a software locked 60 with a 70 battery.  15 of a software locked 60 with a 75 battery.
"it aligns exactly with it.. they sell you a 75w battery and only let you use 65w capacity.  so clearly, the 75w battery is profitable at the 65w price point. "
"Idk why you’ve been downvoted, I agree that gas isn’t a perfect solution either. What I meant “topped off on gas” I was comparing the charging to already having gas in the tank. So someone who’s car is at home with 70% or more of the tank full will be able to flee to safety and not need a stop for gas, just like someone who can charge at home will likely not have to stop at a charger. 

However, for EV vehicles if you aren’t 100% charged up you WILL likely have to stop and charge up. And that can take hours depending on where you’re charging and how busy the charging location is. Both cars have their issues and both will leave people inevitably screwed, but I’d place my safety on a gas powered if I had to choose. "
"It’s not being limited by the ECU, it’s being limited because you drive a shit car and the efficiency of the fuel system and power curve has hit a plateau. If you add more fuel and more air you would continue to make power.  

most likely what you think is ""losing power"" is actually just running out of gear and has nothing to do with the engine but is actually the transmission."
"> people will actually defend them integrating DLC into cars is mind boggling.

&#x200B;

This is a weird argument. You might have a point if you're talking about fully autonomous software that you can pay for and download at a later time. But getting the benefits of a larger battery while choosing to buy a 65kwh car is anything but. 

&#x200B;"
"Honestly, I'm trying to understand the argument.  From Tesla's point of view, the cost of manufacturing is the same if they are only putting one type of battery in the car.  I get the argument that ""you pay for what you get"", but it doesn't make any sense from a logical standpoint - the battery is already there, you paid for it.  

It literally is DLC for cars, but fanboys gonna fanboy I guess. "
"It's not like anybody was forced to get it. It was openly acknowledged and put forward as a cheaper way to get into a Tesla before Model 3 was available. Nobody who felt ""cheated"" (out of something they didn't even pay for) bought one, so it's not an issue. "
I completely agree. But that doesn't mean the company can't show some good will for its customers. 
I actually get free charging at work so that's my primary charging location. If I didn't get the free charging it would increase my monthly bill by about $30-$45.
Electricity prices will vary throughout the world but it is easy to figure out what you home charging cost would be.   The Model 3 efficiency is around 4.2 miles per kWh.   The average cost of electricity in the US 13 cents per kWh.   The range of the Model 3 is 310 miles.   So it would cost roughly $9.62 for a full charge that will get you 310 miles of range.   You can take your local cost per kWh and do the calculation for yourself.   
Yes they should all have free supercharging.   Again this is two separate things.   They have enabled free supercharging on all cars - mostly this will benefit Model 3s.   And cars with software locks on the battery will have had this limitation removed.   
"Yeah, you don’t know what you’re taking about. It doesn’t. Are you supposed to charge to 100%?  Not if you don’t need to, on a regular basis...  are you supposed to drain to zero % on a regular basis?  Not if you don’t need to...  are both of those things bad for the longevity of the battery?  Yes.  Does that have anything to do with Tesla unlocking software limited batteries, to allow them higher range and capacity?  Not even a little bit. "
"Tesla owns it all, as does Panasonic.  One, the other, or both are listed on all IP for their batteries, with unlimited lifetime license for all battery related technology between the companies.

Basically, their idea is to sell cars they wouldn't ordinarily be able to sell.  They do this by taking a model they already build, artificially limiting it in a modest way, selling it at a lower (very low or no profit) price, and then offering to unlock the limitation if the buyer pays the difference.

This model can work well for either party, actually.  If you don't need the extra 50 miles of range, you don't need to pay for it, and you will be guaranteed a much longer battery lifetime.  On the other hand, if you do find yourself needing the 259 miles instead of 208 (actual numbers), you can just pay that difference in price to remove the limit.  If you choose to unlock it, you're just as if you had initially bought it this way, and Tesla has made its nominal profit for a 75 car.  There really isn't a loss to the customer.  Initially, they were charging about $1000 extra, but now they don't do this, and actually offer the upgrade unlock service for less than the original price difference.  They started doing them for around $3000 not too long ago, which is actually a lot less than the price difference between models of the car (5000-8000)."
Not too familiar with Volts. Are you saying running the vehicle in gas mode will also charge the built in battery?
"Not a problem! And you're right. HP is a measure of instantaneous power, just like kW is. And with electricity, the formula is super simple: Current x Voltage = Watts. The pack has a maximum amperage output (and it can always give it), but voltage goes down."
"It’s propane, and if (as it usually does) the utility connection browns out first, it will have the generator already online before grid power finally fails - it usually starts within a second, and is online within about 5. In fact, just the other day it managed to pop the utility’s HV breaker: we browned out long enough to fire the generator, but immediately came above 212V. The digital load controller will remain on utility power but leave the generator running for one minute. A second brownout occurred long enough for the controller to switch to the generator, which was instantaneous (it was already running) but *out of sync* and I had a dryer, boiler, oven, and pool pump running. They fell into the generator’s frequency easily but when the controller saw utility power come back up pretty much right away and switched back, there must have been enough inductance in the system that *bang* popped the breaker and took four other neighbors offline. And no, no back feed. I thought “oh god I owe that electrician a summons” so called the power company to warn them, all was good. Only thing we could come up with was there being enough of a lag from reactive power loading. Scared the living daylights out of me!"
"Yes. An ICE only ends up being around 30% efficient (and usually it only gets close to that at it's torque peak, full throttle...and even *then* most engine controllers give more fuel than necessary to prevent predetonation and cool the piston). Then of that the figure is usually 18% or so lost in an automatic transmission drivetrain. The only reason the generator does any better is because it runs at a single speed (3600rpm, just like every 60Hz AC generator) and the drivetrain is, well, the shaft of the alternator. "
">You still don't make any sense. Was your off topic rant directed at the world in general and just made as a reply to me because I'm just unlucky?

100%. Bingo. We can end this interaction now. Nothing against you, in particular. "
"Subsidies, tax credits...whatever...they are paid for with taxpayers money anyway as the dollars lost by giving some people a tax credit need to be recovered somewhere else. The point is that people don't want to pay taxes to secure the quality of life of those who'd live on this planet 250-500 years from now ."
"Yeah, im familiar with the units, I have been looking at how much a 75/100 provide. But in the scale of things, I can understand what you are saying now about how much electricity they can provide, that is immense, lol 5 days straight! So how is Tesla enabling additional battery capacity? How long before this becomes a problem on the batteries? "
N O R E A S O N
"TO SHREDS, YOU SAY"
"Good attitude to have, don’t forget at 1am you were probably exhausted which also doesn’t help when it comes to critical thinking skills. "
"At least you didn't get stuck in the ditch on a snowy night, forget your cell phone so you sleeping the car and then get woken up three hours later because your cell phone slipped out of your pocket and jabbed you in the back."
Reset the trip meter when you fill up to remember how far you've gone.
An i5 is a i7 with disabled hyper-threading. An i3 is a i7 with disabled cores and disabled turbo boost.
"Something I haven't seen anyone say (and apologize if you found this info later) is that charging a Tesla battery from 0-80% takes about the same amount of time as 80-100%. When the software-locked 60kWh battery was available, a lot of people actually chose that option because supercharging was way faster (you could charge from zero to full in 20 minutes not 40).

Also, Tesla made it very clear a 60kWh battery was actually a software-locked 75, so they weren't deceiving anyone. "
"Oh my God, they use the same fucking battery. It's an artificial limitation they use to exploit their customers."
"You paid for a car, you didn't know they limited your driving distance.
  
Imagine if a gas car limited how much fuel you could use, but you had to take it to a dealership to ""unlock"" the rest of the tank."
"Thanks for helping me understand. 

It’s kinda how like a game maker has people pay for a basic version of a game, but if people want to play the side quests then they have to pay more. It’s the same game, but the side quests are locked for people that just bought the locked version of the game.

If the game maker sold the full game at the more affordable price, they wouldn’t make as much profit since they already had to create all of the game assets. Since the game is now affordable to more people then people that love the game can pay extra for the enhanced experience.

The game maker makes more $ and more people are able to afford to play the game. 

The S75 is kinda like the DLC for the S60."
"No, i do all the maintenance on my car myself. Here is how you ""remove 3 screws"" to replace my phone's  battery...

[iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Samsung+Galaxy+S8+Battery+Replacement/90309)

Introduction

This guide involves removing the rear glass cover, you will need replacement adhesive to reattach the back cover of the phone.

Before disassembling you phone, discharge the battery below 25%. the battery can catch fire and/or explode if accidentally punctured, but chances of that happening are much lower if discharged.

If your battery is swollen, do not heat your phone. If needed, you can use a dropper or syringe to inject isopropyl alcohol (90+%) around the edges of the back cover to weaken the adhesive. Swollen batteries can be very dangerous, sow wear eye protection and exercise due caution, or take it to a professional if you’re not sure how to proceed.
Tools

Buy these tools...Phillips #000 Screwdriver... iOpener ...Suction Handle...Halberd Spudger... iFixit Opening Picks set of 6... Spudger

Buy these parts: Galaxy S8 Battery  $34.99...Galaxy S8 Battery Adhesive Strips... Galaxy S8 Rear Cover Adhesive... Tesa 61395 Tape

Step 1 iOpener Heating
We recommend that you clean your microwave before proceeding, as any nasty gunk on the bottom may end up stuck to the iOpener. Place the iOpener in the center of the microwave.

        For carousel microwaves: Make sure the plate spins freely. If your iOpener gets stuck, it may overheat and burn.

Step 2

    Heat the iOpener for thirty seconds.

    Be careful not to overheat the iOpener during the repair. Overheating may cause the iOpener to burst.

    If the iOpener is still too hot in the middle to touch, continue using it while waiting for it to cool down some more before reheating. A properly heated iOpener should stay warm for up to 10 minutes.

    Remove the iOpener from the microwave, holding it by one of the two flat ends to avoid the hot center.

Step 4 Rear Glass Assembly

    Opening your phone will compromise its waterproof seals. Have replacement adhesive ready before you proceed, or take care to avoid liquid exposure if you reassemble your phone without replacing the adhesive.

    Apply a heated iOpener to a long edge of the S8 for about 2 minutes.

        You may need to reheat and reapply the iOpener several times to get the phone warm enough. Follow the iOpener instructions to avoid overheating.

    A hair dryer, heat gun, or hot plate may also be used, but be careful not to overheat the phone—the OLED display and internal battery are both susceptible to heat damage.

    As you're waiting for the adhesive to soften, move on and read the following step to get an idea of where to pry.

Step 5

    In the following steps you will be cutting through the adhesive around the edge of the rear glass panel.
    The prying pattern as seen from the outside of the phone is as follows:

Step 6
Once the back panel is warm to the touch, apply a suction cup as close to the heated edge of the phone as you can while avoiding the curved edge. The suction cup will not make a good seal on the curved portion of the glass.

        If the phone's back cover is cracked, the suction cup may not stick. Try lifting it with strong tape, or superglue the suction cup in place and allow it to cure so you can proceed.

    Lift on the suction cup, and insert a halberd spudger, or opening pick, under the rear glass.

        Due to the curved glass, you will be pushing up, rather than inserting parallel to the plane of the phone.

Step 7
Once you have the tool firmly inserted into the glass, reheat and reapply the iOpener to soften the adhesive.

Step 8
Slide an opening pick or the blade of a Halberd spudger down the side of the phone, separating the adhesive. Go slowly so that the tool doesn't slip out of the seam. If cutting becomes difficult, reheat and reapply the iOpener.

Step 9
Repeat the previous heating and cutting procedure for the remaining three sides of the phone. Leave an opening pick on each side as you continue to the next to prevent the adhesive from resealing. Leave an opening pick on each side as you continue to the next to prevent the adhesive from resealing.

Step 10
The fingerprint sensor cable connects the phone to the rear glass near the main camera. The cable is very short and should disconnect as the rear glass is removed. As you lift the glass, peek in to be sure the orange cable with a blue connector has disconnected.

    Use the opening picks to slice through any remaining adhesive and open the phone slightly.

    If the fingerprint sensor cable seems snagged or stays taut do not open the phone any further. Disconnect the connector with the point of a spudger before proceeding.

    During reassembly, in order to reconnect the fingerprint sensor cable, first angle the back cover into position until the cable connector lines up perfectly over its socket. Then, use the flat end of your spudger to gently snap the connector into place by pressing it straight down.

    Remove the glass from the phone.

For reassembly, if the fingerprint scanner is removed from the back cover: it’s much easier to place the fingerprint scanner in the small compartment on the back of the phone, connect it and then finally put the replacement back cover on. The adhesive on the inside of the back cover will get connect to the fingerprint scanner and hold it tightly.

Step 11

    To reinstall the back cover:

        First use tweezers to peel away any remaining adhesive from both the back cover and the phone's chassis.

        Then, clean the adhesion areas with high concentration isopropyl alcohol (at least 90%) and a lint-free cloth. Swipe in one direction only, not back and forth. This will help prep the surface for the new adhesive.

        Be sure to turn on your phone and test your repair before installing new adhesive and resealing the phone.

        Replacement adhesive comes in a pre-cut sheet to match the exact contours of the back cover. If that's not available, you can use a high-bond double-sided tape, such as Tesa 61395. Be aware that this leaves gaps that are vulnerable to liquid intrusion.

        After installing the rear cover, apply strong, steady pressure to your phone for several minutes to help the adhesive form a good bond, such as by placing it under a stack of heavy books.

    If desired, you may reinstall the back cover without replacing the adhesive. Remove any large chunks of adhesive that might prevent the back cover from sitting down flush. After installation, heat the back cover and apply pressure to secure it. It won't be waterproof, but the glue is usually more than strong enough to hold.

Step 12 NFC Antenna and Charging Coil Assembly

    Remove eleven 3.7 mm screws.

Step 13

    Remove the NFC antenna and charging coil assembly.

Step 14 Loudspeaker Assembly
    Remove three 3.7 mm Phillips #000 screws.

Step 15.

    Remove the loudspeaker assembly.

Step 16 Battery
    Use the flat end of a spudger to disconnect the battery connector.

Step 17

    Prepare an iOpener and apply it directly to the battery for at least two minutes. Reheat and reapply the iOpener as needed.

    Alternatively, apply some isopropyl alcohol under each corner of the battery and allow it to penetrate for several minutes to help weaken the adhesive.

Step 18
Use an opening pick to pry up the battery from the bottom. You will be prying against the case directly above the daughterboard and antenna cables. Pry carefully to avoid damaging either of these components.

    You may need to reheat and reapply the iOpener repeatedly to further soften the adhesive. The adhesive is tough and it may take a few tries to get the pick started under the battery.

    Try your best not to deform the battery during this process. Soft-shell lithium-ion batteries can leak dangerous chemicals, catch fire, or even explode if damaged. Do not use excessive force or pry at the battery with metal tools.

Step 19
Slide the opening pick up the side of the battery to break apart remaining adhesive. Lift the battery out of the case. Do not reuse the battery after it has been removed, as doing so is a potential safety hazard. Replace it with a new battery.

        Remove any remaining adhesive from the phone, and clean the glued areas with isopropyl alcohol and a lint-free cloth.

        Secure the new battery with pre-cut adhesive or double-sided adhesive tape. In order to position it correctly, apply the new adhesive into the phone, not directly onto the battery. The adhesive should go around the perimeter of the battery compartment, but not in the rectangular cutout in the center (which is actually the back side of the display).

        Press the battery firmly into place for 5-10 seconds."
"What would be your definition of it? 

I am not being facetious, genuinely just felt like what you said wasn’t entirely correct and could easily be misinterpreted "
"<Edit: looks like I’m not entirely correct on the Tesla part below - at some point there was some limiting of the 75kWh battery down to 60kWh but not the 100kWh down to 75kWh. Please see the replies to this comment from other users.>

From what I understand, Tesla sells a couple variations of the model S - one with a 75kWh capacity and another with a 100kWh capacity. However due to maximizing production efficiency on their assembly line, they all have the same 100kWh battery arrays in them and 75kWh models have been software limited to only be able to access a portion of the battery array. During emergencies Testa typically ‘unlocks’ this extra capacity of around 50-70 miles for people with 75kWh models to help them evacuate. 

The whole idea of producing one item but software limiting its functionality depending on how much you’re willing to pay is apparently very common as it helps newer companies or newer product to minimize production costs (since you only need a single assembly line instead of multiple lines) while still allowing different levels of functionality and features that people will pay lower or higher for. I guess Windows operates somewhat like this too by turning off features of you haven’t bought the pro version. I believe CPUs are also produced in this manner, with several versions produced similarly (for example all with 10 cores) but with cores being made inaccessible at the end of production to sell a 6, 8, and 10 core version of the CPU. "
That was debunked
"Yes. Your phone does this too. 

Personally, I’m in the “complete freedom over everything” camp, so I would prefer if people could mess with these sorts of things manually. But that’s just me, and it’s not that big of a deal. "
"No, they offer an increased battery capacity as an upgrade when your purchase your car, like AC or power windows. They’re temporarily giving people who didn’t upgrade that capacity. What you’re saying is true, but the increased capacity isn’t hitting those outer bounds even."
"Great point, those lower performance engine tunes are also intentionally lower performance specifically to reduce fleet MPG - another reason the cheap ECU reflash to gain horsepower costs a lot more than just the price of changing software - beyond warranty cost increases they also have to pay fines if their fleet MPG goes up."
"Nope, seen many cars before and after a flash (Audis, BMW) that made more power by a significant amount. Alpha performance is another company as well."
"I replied to another comment with this so I'll post it here too. 

> Well if the car comes with all the bells and whistles but you have to pay to unlock it after delivery then I think its dlc. Its like your car comes with a v8 engine but you're only able to access 4 of those cylinders. Why do I have those 4 extra cylinders in my car if I can't use them? 

Not comparing them to EA in terms of ""sense of pride and completion"" but as ""give us more money to full unlock the features in your car"". Give me less battery so the car weighs less. Don't lock the battery behind a pay wall. "

"From what I recall this isn't quite what was happening. Each chip would be tested after production to find what frequency it could run stably at, then be limited to operate within stable frequencies. They get segmented for packaging/pricing based on what frequency they get rated stable at.

So the different levels/price points within the same line of chips aren't because they were manufactured to different frequencies but because they naturally come out spread over a range of heat/power/performance tolerances. Not really shiesty, some people misinterpreted that and hyped up a stink.

Luckily there's enough healthy competition in the CPU market that it's not in any manufacturer's interest to ship chips with any less performance than they could.

Edit:
[Wikipedia on clock rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate):
> This metric is most useful when comparing processors within the same family, holding constant other features that may affect performance. Video card and CPU manufacturers commonly select their highest performing units from a manufacturing batch and set their maximum clock rate higher, fetching a higher price."
"AMD’s Ryzen, Threadripper and Epyc lines do it the other way around - they’re pieces together from dual core modules. Intel still do it as a single n-core module (which appears to be the cause of the yield issues they’re having at 10 nm), although they have at various times stitched together multiple modules - Core2Quad did, and I believe some of their current chips are as well. "
Many people would have no problem with it.  Many would.
No that wasn't what happened.   For a short period of time Tesla made one battery pack (75kWh) and software locked it to 60 kWh if you wanted to pay a lower price.  It was to simplify manufacturing and give the consumer more choice.   If you wanted the full 75kWh pack then you would have paid more.   Or you could have unlocked it after the fact for a cost.   
"That's not how that works at all. You paid for 65w of battery capacity, not 75w, and saved thousands of dollars because of that. 

Why do you think that you're entitled to a bigger battery on the basis that you paid less?

Apple sells phones with different harddrive sizes, and their costs of going up a size is far lower than the additional profit they get. But you don't see people buying the 32GB phone, and demanding they upgrade it to 128GB"
"yes. correct. and the 75w is profitable at a 75w price point. This is called a profit margin. SpaceX rocket costs 80million. If they start reflying them multiple times that price will go down to like 8 million...but they will still charge 60ish probably. because they are still cheaper than anybody else and they want to make money. They are not price gouging you, check the competition, find something better. 

A 65kWh battery is probably cheaper but having just one battery, a 75kWh and instaling that, they lose some money on the battery, but save money on manufacturing costs as they simplify production, need less storage etc.  maybe that is what is tipping the scale. And they calculate that some of those people will upgrade at some point so they give them the option to do so in software instead of trying to price gouge them into buying a new battery or a new car.

They paid for 60kWh, they got 60kWh even if it's a 75kWh battery, none of your business."
"It’s pretty hard to take you seriously when you aren’t even using the correct units or have the correct information. 

Tesla sells a 75 **kWh** pack today, that, for a limited time to move more cars, was lowered in price to match the previously discontinued 60 kWh models.

At the time, it wasn’t advertised as being a software locked pack, so when owners found out, it was actually of great benefit to them (for one, I would’ve been ecstatic at this news). 

Why? Because now I have the opportunity to increase the functionality of the car at a small price. Even if I don’t, I know my battery will pretty much be in ideal charging conditions even if I charged it to 100% everyday. 

But this conservation isn’t really going anywhere so I’m gonna end it here. "
> Rev-limiters are built into the ECU (computer) of the car. When an engine is spinning at it's maximum RPM set by the manufacturer the ECU will not send a spark to particular cylinders to prevent the engine from spinning faster and potentially damaging itself
"You're right, there are obvious differences. I guess I just don't like the precedent it sets. If Ford released a mustang where you have to pay extra to unlock the last 2 cylinders, would everyone be ok with that too? "
"Similar concept to a lot of other tech things, ie CPUs/hard drives. It's cheaper to build the same model and if there might be some issues or low demand, sell it for lower price at a software-locked speed/power.
Ex: i7 chip being sold as i5. 1TB hard drive being sold as 500GB."
"Full disclosure:  I bought a locked 60kWh and later upgraded it to the 75kWh when they discounted the upgrade price a year and a half ago.

From Tesla's perspective, producing a 60kWh battery in addition to the 75kWh was not cost effective at the time - it was literally cheaper to produce a 75kWh battery than a 60kWh due to manufacturing processes and scale.  Therefore your only option at the lower level (ignoring the higher capacity ones for this argument) is to produce the 75kWh.

The S75 car is selling at let's say $75k when theydiscontinued producing the 60kWh batteries for the S60 car (which sold at let's say $68k).  I'm purchasing a car, and I don't need the larger battery because I only use it for my commute and local trips and can charge it every night.

Without the software locked options, my only option is to purchase the S75 for $75k.  I'm now paying $7k more for a feature I don't need.  With the software locked option, I can save the $7k (and still have the option to upgrade at a later date).  How is that not better for me, the consumer?

If your argument is ""why not sell the S75 for $68k?"" then you need a lesson in economics."

"Yes. There are four driving settings:
- Normal: EV only 45 miles of range
- Sport:  Increased response / acceleration
- Mountain: Save/recharge up to a 40% buffer to preserve full power on long drives in mountains
- Hold: Runs the gas generator to preserve any battery % you want to hold. More efficient at 50mph+

When used as backup power in Normal you run through the full 10.5 Kw and then the generator turns on occassionally while it builds a  buffer."
"
Your understanding is 100% incorrect.  The difference is a subsidy is paid for by everyone, but you are the only person paying your taxes.  If you are subsidized, I have to pay your bills.  If you are tax credited, you pay yourrself.  Subsidies are a tax everyone pays a stranger, tax credits are a credit you pay to yourself.  You cannot get a tax credit if you didn't already pay that tax, this is why the $7500 EV tax creditrequires you to make about $55000 per year - if you make less you don't pay enough money in your taxes to qualify for the full credit.  That money doesn't come from nowhere, it comes from your own paycheck.  

I feel like this will be discarded, you're not sounding like a person that actually wants to know why they are mistaken and are simply repeating someone else's mistakes in an angry rant, but if *I* am mistaken I hope learning this new information helps you rant more accurately in the future.

"> So how is Tesla enabling additional battery capacity? 

Software update unlocking capacity that was unused by a small % of cars that had a larger battery installed than the owner actually purchased.  They did this when they upgraded the low end battery from 60 to 75, some 60 buyers were given a software limited 75 rather than making them an older battery because the production line had already been converted over.  There aren't a huge number of these owners out there, but they just unlocked free upgrades.  The free supercharging applies to everyone, not everyone had that by default - for a long time it was a paid option unless you upgraded to the largest battery.

>How long before this becomes a problem on the batteries?

Never, they've just had their battery unlocked to its actual full capacity.  A lot of people think this is unlocking the brick protection too, but that's wrong."

Ouch. Literally and figuratively.
Yeah that could work. I drive it all day for work and sometimes you think it's only a few minutes I can make it but you cant. And you forgot to reset the reserve so how your walking and you only have your self to blame on your nice walk back.
"Worth mentioning that i3 and i5 are also typically binned lower (meaning lower clock speeds) and those disabled cores are likely to have been nonfunctional due to defects in the first place, so not exactly the same thing as what Tesla was doing."
[deleted]
"You paid for a car with a 60kWh battery and got a 75kWh battery limited to 60kWh.  
This has several advantages over a 60kWh battery with no limits.  
1. Faster supercharging  
2. Daily recharge can be set to 100% instead of 80-90% without causing extra wear on the battery 
3. Upgradable to 75kWh 
4. Additional spare capacity as the battery ages, increasing the time before battery wear reduces driving range. (Probably adds 5-10 years before battery wear results in reduced range). 
 "
You're an idiot. 
"Your analogy is a little off; the S75 isn't DLC for the S60, the S60 is a trimmed down version of the S75.

The S75 is the base product. To use the video game analogy, the S75 is like the full Call of Duty game, single player story and multiplayer both. 

The S60 comparatively would be if the COD developers decided to sell a separate game that just included the single player story portion of the game ***at a discounted price***, but allowed you to pay the difference to unlock the multiplayer later on if you were so inclined.

They wouldn't make as much profit off the single player only version of the game, but it would provide a cheaper game for people who either couldn't afford the full game or didn't need the multiplayer portion of the game."
No matter how hard you try to overclock your CPU you are not going to damage it. Unless the temperature gets too high. You can always put the settings back to normal and it will function just as before with no difference in performance. Thus it has no damage. 
"CPUs are produced like this, yes, but it isn't all just to arrifically cripple things. CPUs are produced with microscopic precision, and this leads to a lot of things that don't work. Say you want to sell 10,000 8-core CPUs, you might need to make 20,000 and test them. Only half of them might pass all eight cores on the same chip, so the rest will have at least one core fail. If one core fails out of eight, they can sell it as a 6-core CPU. Now they have 10,000 8-cores like they need, but they also have 10,000 6-cores as well. They're software-locked, but the other cores don't necessarily work anyway.

You can also ""bin"" CPUs, which basically tests them and takes the best ones out of the pile. For example my graphics card uses a GPU that was binned higher, which basically means it's more likely to be able to exceed the minimum specs. "
That is not correct.   The 75 kWh batteries have never been software locked versions of the 100 kWh.   Currently the 75 and 100 kWh batteries are actual different sizes.   There was only one point which they did a software locked battery and that was a 75 kWh that was locked to either 60 or 70 kWhs.   It was only done for a short time and it is no longer done.  
"In theory right, but they never did that on the 100kWh battery and all cars sold new now have around the capacity that is advertised and available to the customer.

I think it was mostly the 75kWh battery that was limited to 60kWh. I think the main reason Tesla did this was simply to increase sales by then offering the software limited battery at a lower price. They played around with this a bit also mostly to generate sales and at the end settled on what is available today: 2 battery sized for the S&X and no software limits."
Was it? I thought that was deemed proper life-cycle usage for all LiFeP04 batteries.
I see. So how do they go about getting the increased battery? Do they take it in to get refitted?
[deleted]
That would be a terrible idea for both design and manufacturing.
Making a smaller battery means developing new software for a smaller battery that fully utilizes the battery. Its easier for Tesla to just develop one battery to which they can just adjust its capacity behind a paywall. Also what if you buy the smaller car but at one point would like to upgrade? It's cheaper to just pay for the remainder of your battery than a completely new battery. 
"Someone posted a great explanation the last time Tesla did this for a natural disaster. Basically if a manufacturer wanted to have 3 different sized batteries with different prices, they have to have 3 separate manufacturing processes which raises costs. It's significantly more cost effective to just manufacture one kind of battery and allow customers to choose what would fit their needs/price range, plus it gives customers the option to upgrade at any time if they need to."
"> Give me less battery so the car weighs less. Don't lock the battery behind a pay wall.

This would also increase the price of adding Autopilot post-purchase to more than $20,000 just to save a few pounds of camera weight.  

The warranty prices of software locked batteries are substantially less for the manufacturer also.  They warranty the battery for 8 years whether it's a 60kwh battery or a 100kwh battery, and the things that a user can impact battery lifetime most are charging to 100% all of the time and cycling the battery a lot of times.  A software locked battery can not be charged to 100% ever, and can not be fully cycled 100% to 0% ever.  You see battery weight and DLC, you don't see warranty costs.  This is why Ludicrous mode costs $10,000 to activate.  The only hardware difference is Inconel contators that don't cost anything close to that much money and install in 30 minutes, but the upgrade is expensive because the upgrade dramatically increases warranty costs.  It's more than just a weight penalty for Ludicrous too."
"It's far cheaper to make one size of battery and throttle it through software, instead of just building two batteries. Why would they give you the bigger battery for free just cuz?"
"Every car company does things like this.

Every chip manufacturer does things like this.

It's more common than you think."
"The difference here is intent and knowledge. People who bought the software-limited battery either wanted it or didn’t care. They wanted the battery at 60 kWh because that was the range they wanted to purchase. Having the option to later upgrade it is a bonus and nothing more.

Day one dlc and on-disc dlc is usually unknown prior to release, and is important to note that at least for day one dlc, it *was **usually**not ready* to be put on disc. To make the comparison with day one dlc is weird because dlc is inherently digital. It would be as though Tesla sold you the car with a 60 kWh battery and before its delivery to anyone, finally was able to fit the 75 in and then as soon as it’s delivered tells you that you can pay to unlock it."
"But what if you paid the same price as a car with a 4 cylinder engine? Since every new Tesla is capable of full autonomy, I guess everything Tesla does is DLC lol "
"Oh interesting, I hadn’t heard that before"
"They do sort batches, but they don't limit sales based on what fails and what passes a max performance test.  "
"I think the takeaway is that

1. They charge you less by simply locking away access to something
2. But they don't gain back anything by doing so, typically this means that they are putting less hardware in the car as well, saving on costs themselves and explaining the lower price point. That isn't the case here.
3. This means people paying for 75 are just being marked up to solely by software that ""shouldn't"" be there in the first place. It's an entirely artificial gate, which is atypical and rubs some people the wrong way.
"
"His point, and your analogy would only make sense if Apple phones all came installed with 128GB drives, but each one had different limits on the amount you could store unless you paid for more.  

They are saying that at face value, it's a little shitty/weird to think about the fact that you are in-fact purchasing/owning the larger battery pack. The larger battery pack is owned, and it's in your possession, but the manufacture will not allow the ""rights"" to it unless you ""pay to unlock it.""  "
"the units don't really change the premise of the argument. you're picking a minor thing from my argument and trying to invalidate it based on that. 

You're ending the conversation because you're wrong and you know you're wrong. good, day. "
"In many cases, wheel torque is optimal before or at the redline because of engines and transmissions’’s stock design. So from a sheer acceleration standpoint, it’s often not even worth it to go over it *for a stock car*. "
"http://www.epi-eng.com/piston_engine_technology/power_and_torque.htm

and 

http://www.epi-eng.com/mechanical_engineering_basics/energy_and_work.htm

Here just so you can learn, because thats important. "
"If the lower cylinder option cost less... why not?

If you wouldn't buy such a car, don't buy the cheap option. If you would, yay more options!

It's the car manufacturer that is losing out really. Having to pay for the extra cylinders and not making (as much) of a profit off them..."
"Your CPU anecdote doesn’t hold water. They make one chip, then performance is tested, the number of functioning FETs, etc. determine whether it is an i7 or an i5.

Intel fabs are basically a constant forest fire trying to be contained, it’s a miracle anything is ever even produced."
"So I did a bit of research, and it seems that many i3 and i5 chips are i7s that failed inspections or were otherwise not up to i7 standards.  I'm not sure about hard drives.  

Either way, that still doesn't make sense.  Maybe from a manufacturing standpoint, but it's still literally DLC for cars.  If I was going to shell out the money for a Tesla I would get the most I could anyway, but still comes off poorly. "
"Well, considering I have an Economics degree, and my argument isn't ""why not"" it's ""this is DLC for cars"", and I think you're being duped, I think I'll skip the extra lesson. 

Teslas are obviously profitable for the company at $68k with the 75kWh battery, or they wouldn't make them.  However, because of some clever marketing and a lack of critical thinking on the part of consumers, they are able to artificially inflate the value of a fully unlocked battery.  So, they are making 100% pure profit on the unlocked cars.  

From an Economics standpoint, of course it makes sense.  For Tesla.  From a consumer standpoint, no, it doesn't make sense, because you've already paid for the battery.  That's my point, the physical thing is there, in the car, in your driveway already.  You're paying extra to use something you already own. 

You're not 'upgrading', you're paying for the privilege to use the full capacity of something you've already purchased.  You don't need an Economics degree to figure that one out, but I went ahead and got one anyway, just to be helpful. "

"With average driving on the freeway/streets, how much can you charge the car battery on an average drive of an hour or so?"
"> That money doesn't come from nowhere, it comes from your own paycheck.

It doesn't matter where does it come from, what does matter is where do those dollars end up....the government . With the tax credit in place the government will get less money from people making 55k/yr (or more) compared to a scenario in which no tax credit is in place, so they'd have to make up for that by taking money from somewhere or someone else, and there is only one place for them to get it: other people's pockets.

This is self-evident as the real beneficiaries of such policy (Americans and citizen of the world who'd come into life 250-500 years from now) cannot fit the bill as they are not here yet

Heat is the worst thing for lithium batteries. All the other stuff came from when NiCd batteries were a big thing.

Its kind of shitty. "
The problem people have with it is the cost to Tesla is the same whether you want the smaller battery than the larger one.
"It should be included because it is already installed. i was just pointing out the fact that it is a feature that is in the car to unlock a batteries full potential. the batteries are already there. It makes sense from a corporate perspective, and obviously i love Tesla as a company, but its day one DLC bro."
"Right. If you didn't like that they had a software limit on the battery then you just pay more to unlock the additional battery. They basically said ""hey we have a car that costs $X with this battery or a car that costs $Y (where Y<X) with this other battery. But if you decide to want the bigger battery later we can enable that at any time, also your charging speeds and battery life will be better with car Y."" Then you decide if the bigger battery is worth $(X-Y).

&#x200B;

Comparing it to DLC is like saying the 60 kwh is $60 and for $30 more in two months you can get the expansion, but it's more like the 75 kwh is $60 but if you don't want the extras then you can pay $45 for the more basic version and upgrade later if you want (example: Overwatch has two versions, a full-price one with more cosmetic skins and a regular one for cheaper)"

good analogy. You could consider it base game versus digital deluxe edition. 
"They did gain something back.   It simplified the manufacturing process so they didn't have to make multiple batteries of different sizes.   Your argument would make sense if the consumer was not aware of this.   When the person bought the car they would have known that the battery was a software locked version.    It wasn't like they snuck these into cars and no one was aware of it.   The consumer got more choice, they could pay less and unlock later if they chose to.   So don't see how this is a bad thing.   "
"You're talking about engine performance with the V6/V8 analogy.  That's not what it is being limited.  It's battery storage.  Which would equate to gas storage.

I don't see how you are not understanding that you are getting what you pay for when you buy the lower capacity battery whether it's true capacity is larger or not."
"Just worries me because that's one small step from ""Pay to unlock speeds greater than..."" or ""Pay to unlock AC option"". I don't love the idea that you own something but can't use it fully without paying extra. Seems like a slippery slope. "
"I question your economics degree, because you seem to have missed a major point. The profit from the higher cost models is only attainable if they produce enough batteries to get that expense down. The profit from the cheaper model is not enough to sustain the company. The only reason it is that much cheaper is to allow more people to be able to afford it."
"> Teslas are obviously profitable for the company at $68k with the 75kWh battery, or they wouldn't make them.

We're in agreement here.

>However, because of some clever marketing and a lack of critical thinking on the part of consumers, they are able to artificially inflate the value of a fully unlocked battery.

The value of a S75 was already set before they discontinued making the 60kWh battery.  The price did not go up on the 75kWh when they discontinued the 60kWh battery, so there was no trickery or artificial inflation of the value -- it was already there based on the market.

If people are willing to pay $75k for a 75kWh, why would you sell them for $68k?  It's not like Tesla is swimming in profits and free cash flow that they can just give money away.

> You're not 'upgrading', you're paying for the privilege to use the full capacity of something you've already purchased.

Right...which you could do when you first buy the car (and pay $75k up front).  If you don't want to pay for it, you don't have to.  Do you have a problem with trial versions of software that have the full functionality but have part of it locked until you buy a full license?  "
"As mentioned, mountain mode has a buffer limit of 40% that can be fully charged in 15 minutes when stopped / a little longer if driving. However driving while charging defeats the purpose of the Volt / EVEN as your mpg  will be wise than simply fully using the battery and then let it run on gas for the rest of your trip so probably a Model 3 or any other BEV will be better for what you probably want."
"> you were trying to complain about is ""tax laws written for the rich"" or something like that

This was a correct assessment of your ranting.  Here, let me try and say what you're trying to say, but with less ignorance:

#TAX LAWS THAT ONLY BENEFIT  THE WEALTHY SUCK

Just rant that and your diatribes won't be factually wrong in the future.  You'll possibly find someone that believes you if you aren't intentionally incorrect from the very beginning, and I hope you find that special someone that can turn that frown upside down."

"Tesla battery packs have a cooling mechanism for their batteries. It may be worst, but over/under charging can also be damaging."
Oh I see now. So the battery physically has more cells that just aren't being used.

"The last two sentences, which I was responding to, are not."
You are not paying for the full battery that's the point. The model s 60 was released at around 50.000 if I am not mistaken.  
"The thing is you didnt pay for it. The cars with the software locks cost less than the ones without it. In otherwords, you have two batteries, one is a 60kwh, the other is a 75kwh locked at 60. Both cost the same."
Right but the cost to Tesla and by extension to every Tesla customer would be a good deal higher if they manufactured different size batteries for every model instead of their current system
"That's absolutely moronic. They're a business, not a charity. 

They are selling you 60kWh of capacity for $x, that's what you've bought, that's what you're entitled to.

They also happen to sell 75kWh of capacity for $y. Why does it matter how the batteries are laid out?"
"Because you didn't pay the full hardware cost, they're taking a loss in their margin (not necessary a negative loss, just that its less than the margin they projected when setting the rates) so you can still have a Tesla at a cheaper price. It would cost them way more to setup a whole other assembly line to produce different size batteries. This way gives customers the best of both worlds."
"Yeah I'm not really hating it or anything, but it is different. I can see why some people have an issue, but like you said they know this going into it. "
"You already 'pay to unlock' everything in a car. You can buy cars without A/C, they cost less cause you know... no A/C.

You can also by slow cars. There are a bunch of cars on the market."
"You can question it all you want, I have a piece of paper that proves it so I don't really care what you think.   

You're not getting my point.  Obviously it's cost effective for them to only produce one battery, or they wouldn't do it.  What I'm saying is that it's still profitable for them at the lower price point.  By restricting the full capacity of the battery, they are artificially lowering the supply curve (hey look an Economics term, let me know if you want me to explain that to you), which raises the price.  The key word here is ""artificially"", because the capacity is there, they just choose to lock it. 

They are essentially selling the same thing at two different price points.  You've already bought the full size battery.  It costs the company literally nothing to unlock it for you (and even if it does, that's a self-imposed expense as they spent money to lock it in the first place), meaning that you are literally just giving them more money to unlock something you already bought and paid for (and which they already made profit on). 

Do you get it yet?  It's a great business model... for Tesla.  Not for you. "
"You guys aren't understanding what I'm saying.  It's obviously good for Tesla to do this.  It's not good for the consumer.  Obviously, it's your choice to buy one, but you're getting duped.  You literally already paid for the battery.  

If you want to have an Economics argument about it, it's a simple supply and demand curve.  Since they stopped making the lower capacity battery, that made the supply of the larger capacity battery go up.  This would normally have the effect of lowering the price or value with all other factors remaining constant.  Whether you look at this as artificially raising the price or lowering the supply of the larger capacity battery, the outcome is the same:  you are paying more than that thing is worth on the free market.  And also paying extra for something you already physically own. 

In the end it doesn't matter, and that is also due to the supply and demand curve.  Ultimately it's worth whatever people are willing to pay for it.  See any Apple product for an example.  Companies take advantage of the fact that their consumer base wants their brand above all others, and will pay a premium for it.  You are being taken advantage of. 

Again, I don't really care, you can do whatever you want with your money.  But understand that you are not thinking critically from a consumer's point of view, but rather from the company's.  "
"I was just re-reading your comment and noticed your analogy to trial software at the bottom.  

To answer your question, yes, I would have a problem with trial software if they charged you for it.  I do not have a problem with a free trial software that you would have to pay for a license to fully use. "
"No it isn't. It's them mocking people. The ""base"" model could just as easily sell at the lower price."
"How about they don't fuck over their consumers? How about that?
  
If they're only going to make one battery, then just sell one fucking battery. Don't lock off full access and act like it's a different product."
"Haha yeah, I really wish we had a few more companies competing in the market, but hopefully AMD is stepping it up and there's a little more interesting stuff in the works from both them and Intel. "
"Oracle is on a whole other level.

""Don't benchmark our shitty software. Don't talk about benchmarking our shitty software. Do you run our shitty software in a room with two computers? We're charging you a license fee for that second computer. I don't care if it *is* a Commodore 64; our software probably runs fine on that hardware. But don't benchmark it."" 

AMD started an avalanche with Threadripper. Nobody can compete with Intel on single-core performance. Anyone can compete with Intel on many-core peformance. 

Just don't use any Oracle products in the same room, because they'll charge you separately for each core."
"No it doesn’t matter, because like this whole thread started it’s about trim levels 60 vs 75. And lots of gas cars have the exact same engine in different trims that produce different ratings. Pretty simple to get, I don’t understand how you’re not getting that. It’s not about the engine has a turbo or a supercharger, it’s about it being the exact same in multiple trims and producing different numbers."
"But...you are though...

The full battery exists, it's in your car, you own it. It has the physical capability to hold and utilize the full charge. The only thing stopping that is an artificially created barrier. But that barrier doesnt change the battery in any way. Barrier or no barrier its literally the same battery. "
"They are the same battery. Theres just a limiter placed on it. 

Okay so i sell motherboards. Theres four RAM slots. You buy four 2gb RAM sticks from me, I only charge you for three,  you install the 8gb worth of RAM, but i put something in the firmware of the mobo that forces it to only recognize 6gb/8gb. The system isnt recognizing the forth stick. I can sell you a firmware update to get the system to do so. 

But it still exists! It's there you can see it! Its right in your computer, its tangible, its made out of matter you can reach out and touch it. The limit i imposed on the system didnt create or destroy or teleport any mass away. Its still the same RAM. 

You see what i mean? "
"True, but the cost to tesla would be the same if they gave everyone the higher capacity and didn't have the tier system at all. That's why it's controversial."
"Tesla is a company that wants to make money, which is perfectly fine, but it has nothing to do with giving the customer the best options. They are clearly fine with selling their product at that price, so it's 100% about just wanting to make more money from some people.

Alternative way to look at it, if Tesla would be perfectly fine with you owning that car and never upgrading, it would change nothing for them if that bit magically flipped for you."
"Yes, but you can't buy cars that have AC and don't let you use the AC. That's a very important distinction. "
"Ok, but if they made a 60 kwh battery it would cost you more to buy the car. If they only made 75 kwh batteries it would cost you more money. They are shifting the cost from the 60 kwh model towards the 75 kwh model. "
"> To answer your question, yes, I would have a problem with trial software if they charged you for it.

Do you use Windows?  If so, what edition?  Home?  Professional?  Ultimate?"
"I'm going to venture to guess you don't really have any idea what the fuck you are saying and are just trying to find a reason to be outraged.

""Why don't they just sell their cars for cheaper? Sure they'll lose revenue but who gives a fuck?"" What a fucking stupid idea.

***
I'll try to explain this to you so that you can understand.

Step 1: The s75 was sold at a price that gave Tesla an acceptable profit margin.

Step 2: There was some demand for a cheaper model with less features. Tesla also wanted to provide a cheaper model with less features.

Step 3: Due to the economy of scale, producing another completely new battery with lower capacity was not financially viable, so Tesla opted to produce more 75 kWh batteries and just limit them AND SELL THEM FOR CHEAPER.

Result: 2 models, 2 price points, 1 battery. 

Everyone who bought the s60 expected a 60 kWh battery and received a 60 kWh battery.

***

I hope that helps. If not, fuck off."

"The difference being that Tesla customers know beforehand what capacity they're getting and make a decision based on that.

Not to mention the whole situation is entirely different because the Tesla owner makes the decision for the smaller battery. Whereas in your example, the person buying ram wanted 8gb not 6. The comparison would only be relevant if the person only wanted 6, but you still give them 4 2gb sticks without charging for the 4th. 

What's actually in the product doesnt matter as long as it meets the specifications that the consumer requested/chose at the agreed upon price point."
"That's not how business works. Yes of course it always comes back to money, that's how they keep their doors open. They sell below the desired margin (and desired isn't just some magic number they'd like to make, it's projecting for costs, future R&D etc) in the hopes you or a future pre-owned buyer upgrades. If less people than they project do the upgrade then their numbers don't look as good for shareholders.

So I'm not claiming it's out of the goodness of their heart that they offer this option, I'm saying it is about money and that's the point. "
"To you it seems... 

I'm not seeing why it seems to upset you though. 

Let's say the manufacture goes through all the hassle of rigging up a perfect A/C and installs it in every car in sells. He knows some people can't afford a car with A/C while plenty can, so he charges a base rate for the car, with an extra cost of the A/C for those that can afford it. Removing (or not installing) the A/C option for some cars just costs too much production wise or he would just sell cars without it in the first place and make even more money. 

What's the big deal? In this situation (and the real life one), everyone saves money because the manufacturer found a way to make cars cheaper while offering more models. If they didn't do this, both the non-A/C car and A/C car would cost more for either party and you couldn't upgrade later without a new car. Let's put it in math terms. Case A - Upgrade to A/C costs an extra 1,000. You can buy CarA-AC 11,000 or CarA-NAC 10,000. OR Case B - No A/C in some models. You can buy CarB-AC 12,000 or CarB-NAC 11,000. That 1,000 difference being the cost to rigs some cars without A/C. No one really gains from Case B other than the producer that gets to charge extra for making two unique model cars. 

It's a win-win. "
"But they aren't making a 60kWh battery.  They only make the 75kWh battery, and sell it for the lower price point (presumably) still making money off that sale.  

At the very least, hopefully we can agree that they are making even more money and profit now off of the larger battery, as by making production more efficient they are saving production costs.  So congrats, you're giving them free money now, for no reason other than they used to make two different sized batteries. 

Is this really so hard to understand? I'm not even saying don't buy it or upgrade, all I'm saying is you should be thinking critically about your purchases.  This makes no sense other than to get as much money into Tesla's pockets as possible.  Which, by their nature as a corporation, is their goal.  I don't blame them for that.  But I do blame everyone in here defending that decision as if it is good for consumers, because it's not.  You're the kind of person that makes this sort of thing possible to pull off, but trust me, you're getting duped. "
"You do realize that's not how this works?
  
This shit is cheap as fuck to Tesla, they can sell it for as little as $12,000 and still make *some* profit."
They sell the same battery but put software limitations in to keep you from using the full product. Ffs
Now all AMD has to worry about is Nvidia playing stupid benchmark games with fixed-function extensions.
"You’re wrong, and also /r/IAmVerySmart. Also just blocking you, not going to waste my time explaining something that doesn’t need any explanation, let alone 4 or 5 times."
">What's the big deal? In this situation (and the real life one), everyone saves money because the manufacturer found a way to make cars cheaper while offering more models. 

You're making it sound like putting a software lock on something is some grand feat of engineering. Since it's public knowledge that the cheaper models are just the same physical battery as the more expensive ones, only difference being the intentional software restrictions in place, doesn't that beg the question: why the more expensive model at all? If they are able to viably sustain sale of the cheaper ones, and it isn't any more or less expensive to produce wouldn't it stand to reason that they are just charging more for the expensive models because they can? 

Now I'm not saying they aren't allowed to charge more because they can, they absolutely have every right to. They are business and can charge whatever the hell they want for their product. That doesn't mean I have to like it, or agree to it. I can speak with my wallet, and I'm fine with that. I was about to say ""besides there are few other manufacturers that seem to be stepping their game up lately"", but realize now I'm commenting in the Tesla Motors sub, so I'll just slowly back away now..."
"No, that's not really true at all. Tesla's profit margins are slim as fuck because profit margins for all electric cars are slim as fuck.

It is exactly how it works. Just because you are ignorant of economics doesn't mean you have any idea what you are talking about."

Except for the evening gown category. Tesla made a bad outfit choice. Killed the swimsuit contest though. 
How does this compare with the Volvo XC40

There's a human driver caused accident today for every self driving snark in this thread
But how many JD power awards do they have...?
"Anyone know why it takes the nhtsa so long to give a rating? I was shopping for a Honda for my wife in March and the car didn't have a safety resting either, even though it came out the previous september"
I love how no major media outlets reported on this story. If it failed to get 5 stars it would be front-page news for a week.
I noticed that the AWD doesn't yet have a frontal impact rating? I'm guessing it'll do well but there is a DU there so maybe not as well as the RWD?
Now I wish you could see safety (and performance) data for cars in graph form just like video card benchmarks. Would make picking a car so much easier.
So this is why it’s taken so long to get my Black model 3 because they are crashing them for “science”
"“The Tesla Model 3 gets a 5-Star safety rating! But are YOU safe? Something’s in the car!!! GET OUT OF THE CAR!!!!”

Sounds like the tag line to a horror movie."
question - how does a tesla fare in a collision with another tesla?  I'm wondering if the weights and everything that the NHSTA uses are based of normal ICE cars which are lighter than electric cars.  
That’s amazing
"Come to think of it, I don't recall any fatal Model 3 accidents so far. "
"But guys, Elon smoked weed.

/s"
"Congratulations, they've managed to do what any respectable car company can do "
That's good to know
Long assumed but great to see!
Does anybody know how much it will cost in Europe?
Nice to see that my dream car can survive a crash and leave me safe(ish) 
The frontal crash test is very impressive. I can see very little deformation of the cabin. 
"This may seem daft but I'm genuinely curious - Is this the as-yet-unreleased-35k Model or the current 49k Model? Or will the 35k be the exact same model, just with fewer internal accessories?"
This will never be a headline in mainstream news.
Oooh the fair and balanced news will definitely pick this up! /s
Has any other car ever done that?
Too bad they had to destroy 3 week worth of production for that rating 🤣
[deleted]
They had to disable AP because it kept running away.  /s
Gonna need it with their auto pilot system. 
"I've heard that if a Tesla crashes and catches fire, it's an electrical fire and that is extremely more difficult to put out than a gas fire (requires tons more water), plus the whole hazmat issue with it being battery-powered.

Was I misinformed? I'd like to get on the Tesla hype train.

Edit: Really? Downvotes? I'm literally asking to be informed and also expressing a desire to be excited about Tesla Cars. "
"i'm surprised. in fact nothing with a lithium-ion batterie is safe. the fire departments have no real or safe solution to stop the fire or prevent the crap from exploding.

the recent way today is to throw a few tons of sand on the burning car and wait a few weeks until the temeperatur is low enough to transport it. yes, weeks. 

source: i'm responsible for safety in chemical warehouse."

Does that include running into things on the road under autopilot?
If only they didn’t have such high break down rates I’d consider. I’ll wait foe the unbugged version. 
Is this on model 3’s after they reduced the number of welds?
Even though if there’s a complete loss of power emergency services need special tools and knowledge to extract passengers & cut power?
Isn't this par for the course with any new car these days?
I love electric cars but this one is quite pricy 
This will be a huge deal long term. People will now be able to buy a $35k car with perfect safety ratings. This is unheard of.
"In other news NHTSA test agency employees buyout local Porshe dealership. 
"
That'll come in handy when the autopilot is trying to murder you. 
Tail lights notwithstanding.
Ya so what?! Tesla dick sucking going on here. 
Teslas are so safe that nobody will think they are sexy.  Nobody is going to buy this car now. 
Until it drives it self into a wall...
Nothing special 
wow!  I wonder how many months total production they had to send for testing
It doesn’t test for driving you to your death though. Fact.
Is this why they keep missing deadlines?
Is there a sub about shitting on Elon? I like the dude but I like the hate circle jerk even more.

"Skip lunch and you'll be at $53,990!"
You’re almost there!
"If it makes you feel better, the cost of entry is high but once you have the car you feel like your driving a bargain. Saving on the weekly $50 gas fill-up makes you feel like your getting richer ever week! "
Huh? I thought you could get one for 35k by now?
"Lifecycle cost is really low if you get free charging at work and were already considering a luxury car.

Edit: For me compared to the BMW 3 series I would have bought. I did 15k miles mostly city, ended up with $2.5k a year in gas. I got $10k from the government for my Model 3. If I get $20k resale, and rounding for much cheaper maintenance, it's a $0 car for me, but it's a unique case because work is free charging."
Where are you getting that number from? It starts at 30k
serious question just wondering. Why would people go with one of these at nearly 55k when you can get a couple year old Model S for the same price even lower in some instances with very little miles.
Already saved up $20.000 for your Model 3 P? Very impressive!
"Pfft you think the high price is an issue?! I mean there are wait times and every once in a while a car has different coloured internal panels!?! What an absolute shitshow! I know they gave us cars that are cleaner and safer than these multinational companies did, I know they literally saved thousands of lives, but my god someone think of how much that all costs!??


Would someone just think of the money?

/S"
I literally priced one last night in California and it was $39k after state and federal rebates 
Does Tesla not allow people to finance cars?
And wait a couple years on a wait list
"Electric cars are great but they just aren't cheap enough for my budget yet.  I'm going to buy another ICE car, and hopefully 5-10 years from now electric cars will be somewhat affordable for me.  By that I mean start at $20k new.  "
Good luck mate!
"We get ours in a week, maybe this will happen save $10 a month on insurance. It’s only 105/ month to insure (geico 250 deductible) 791/month to own with 10% down..."
The car is 49k. Much less if you include EV discounts. Not sure why you need to save 54k. 
"I'd hold off on that.  They have only managed to manufacture five Model 3's, and these crash tests destroyed three of them."
"Just $5000 down and the $900 a month!

Assuming you spend $900 a month now for gas, the Tesla will pay for itself!"
Strange white interior in these.  Wonder if it's designed to show up the paint on the dummies well.
I don't think I ever appreciated how fast airbags can deploy until now.
Gotta love those gfycat URLs hahaha. Thanks for the links.
That last head on view is terrifying.
I like how the blinkers instantly turn on on hit. Is this the behavior of other car brands as well?
Love to see how the airbags deploy and THEN the window breaks and shatters everywhere. Safety first!
Didja click the link? They're in there...

Can’t believe that back windows doesn’t break.

Amazing how airbags protect us first and then break the glass outwards! Cool stuff

No offense to the testers but how often is a crash below 40 something that we are worried about. I'm more worried about anywhere from 45-60mph
Why NSFW?
Very disappointed that there are still no IIHS results.
I don't think Tesla should be spending money at the moment to purchase JD Power Awards.
"Jd power is a joke, right? Corporations have to pay them in order to be evaluated.

I remember when I worked for a bank we'd go on lockdown for months, no changes, just to try and manipulate the stats so we looked reliable, which we were but we went above and beyond so we could gloat about some purchased rating"

There are plenty of cars with 5 star ratings. I dont expect anything less from any new car. It's not that hard to get 5 stars from the NCAP. The tests a lot of manufacturers have been focusing on is the IIHS' test which the Model S fell short on.
"I remember during the unveil Elon was like, ""this will be 5 star in every category"" and I was thinking oh shit he said that with some confidence. Won't be a good look if he's wrong. 

Then Munroe did their teardown and remarked that there were pieces of the car that were much heavier than they needed to be. At the time Munroe quipped that it was a sign of inferior engineering but someone asked Elon about it and I recall him saying something along the lines of (paraphrasing) ""We chose to make the car very safe"".

I've found proof in my pudding.

"
< profits
"It's easier to make a safe EV, due to the low cog making them harder to roll, and the lack of front engine allowing more crumple zone.

So Tesla took advantage of that, and tries to make **The** safest car."
"I made this comment elsewhere, but Tesla has clearly figured out how to make the safest car based on the tests being done, it seems odd that other manufacturers haven't tried to accomplish the same (i mean, hell, we saw them gaming the EPA's emissions testing, they should try gaming this testing as well), but then you have to think that the other manufacturers might be ""okay"" with a 4 star rating as long as they're saving a ton of money on the bill of materials for the vehicle. "
It was mentioned up-thread as getting a 6.60% rollover resistance rating.
It's cool... the cars are moving reeeeaaaly slowly now...
"It’s subjective, I love the design. "
There probably aren't enough Model 3s in Europe yet.

"Yes & yes and if you notice the glass doesn't shatter into jagged stabby shards, it shatters into large chunks because of the construction of it, less super sharp and pointy edges. Just like the glass in office buildings, it's designed to take an impact and fracture, sending the energy through the entire pane. Old school plated glass would fall out of a building and slice your ass in half if it landed on you. The newer tempered glass would still kill you if it fell on you but wouldn't guillotine you."
It's pretty common actually.
yeah lol. Very happy with this result. Elon promised 5 star safety and delivered. 
Most likely because there are very little of them out right now. 
"Better than Audi, BMW & Mercedes in frontal crash, as well as 30-40% less roll-over risk.... then there's the advanced active safety features which aren't even comparable."
About $1k more than the new VW ID EV.
"The difference is in the batteries and whether or not it has dual motors.  The car itself is the same.

That said, the model tested was the long range rear motor version."
Why should it? 5 starts should be expected these days. Anything else would be news.

"so far Teslas autopilot system performs better than the average driver (so likely worse than the average person who can afford to drive a Tesla as they generally are better educated, have better socioeconomic status etc) hence a few insurances give discount if the autopilot is installed."
"The ""battery fire"" argument is often brought up, even though electric cars have less fires than ICEs. People in this sub are just tired of hearing that argument, and also a tactic used by the ""concerned trolls"" or ""care bears"" that roams this sub.

"I think they are up to 9bn miles of Tesla road miles.

If you look at EV stats, you will see that fire death rates are massively lower than for ICE cars.

As for ""exploding"", which is popular in movies for gas cars, the worst I have seen was in a police car chase, where a Tesla S hit a power pole sideways at 100mph, cutting the car in two. It's on utube. There was a small fire, and the open pack made some ""pop"" sounds  like wimpy fireworks as the cells ""exploded""."

$34/mo. vs $200/mo. is amazing. That's about $20k/10yr in savings."
Yeah but I don't think Teslas are very DIY friendly. Looking into the future..
/r/personalfinance just started crying
"Isn't it still pretty expensive to run, though?

Lol. This sub is nuts 
Just wait until you have to take it to a Tesla authorized service provider to have it fixed. You’ll be charged a fortune and the shops available to you are limited. Good luck trying to get the parts yourself. It’s nearly impossible to service your own Tesla.
"Hah, or $50 every 3 days in my case.  Yep.  I spend over $400 /month on gas."
The cost is truly high but if you are in the market for a car you're probably already in the 30k neighborhood. You have to remember to subtract that before you add the savings. 
"$50 a week. how much do you drive? 

$50 lasts me a whole month and i am in the bay area."
"I bought a used for escape hybrid for 7500 dollars. I fill up about every 3-4 weeks. I get 30-32mpg on average. I only drive around 25 miles a day though.

It's not a Tesla 3 but $47,500 buys a lot of gas! That's pretty much a down payment  for a house or a decent little college education at a state school."
Whatever you got to tell yourself. It’s still a 55k midsize sedan that is in no way wise financially. The gas savings will not come close to making up the difference on what a Camry would cost you.
"Sarcasm? If not, then no, still about 6-8 months away at this point. Can't wait for it to be real, but can't fault Tesla for doing it this way. Nobody is going to sell the cheapest version while they can sell all the pricey ones they can make, and then some."
Any decade now.... 
"If you spend $100 on gas per month, its only $1,000 per year. You're not going to break anytime soon. "
Yeah cars are also cheap when you don’t have to pay for gas.. like what the hell 
"Then you'll just need a new battery 

Those are cheap right?"
I don't understand what you are trying to say....
Taxes.
"Any options will bump the price of the car. Maybe OP wants a paint color other than black, nicer Tesla wheels, or even the performance package. Also, even though in California you qualify for a $2500 tax credit and a $7500 tax credit with the purchase of a model 3, you won't see that money until Tax season. For the time being, you're still on the hook for paying or financing the 55k. Once you get the tax credits, the only thing you are doing is shortening the length of the loan unless you refinance. 

Edit: looked into ordering a Model 3, not down to have an $800/month car payment yet."
"My blue dual motor was exactly $54k, so it doesn't take much to hit that price point.  After taxes and other fees, it was about $60k, so I imagine a RWD car is around $54k total.  And yes you may get money back in incentives, but that's after you buy it.  You still need to have the full purchase price up front, at least in my state."
"I know right?  It’s like the deploy before it even hits it... I know it’s deploying after, but even in slow-mo they are like fortune tellers. "
"They have to deploy that fast. In fact, they are already deflation when you hit them!"
I was just thinking the exact same thing. 
"I heard the cameras can detect a collision before it happens and deploy the airbags. I'm not sure if this is true or not.

Edit:Apparently this is not true, and also a bad idea."
"It's literally a controlled explosion with the gases being used to fill the bags, super quick"
"You also don't realize until you're in an accident how violent they are. In slow mo, it's like a big pillow, but when it happens to you, it's like getting punched really fucking hard."
"That's where I'm looking next time I need a new username.  

"
Have you seen the gif where if compares head on accidents between modern and vintage cars?  The vintage one is terrifying.
True but that screen shattering in slow motion was awesome. The slow mo guys need to do more scenes where they move the camera around exploding stuff.
Most all cars do this.

"Crash engineer here.

"Huh, I'm suprised there are no German brands in the lot."
It's like communism but for cars.
"Maybe they need to improve the tests, then?"
It may have the safety ratings from back then but it certainly won’t have the current safety expectations from today.
"I walked away with out even a bruise, just a little sore. The car was pretty screwed up but the other drivers insurance didn't want to total it out. Fought for 2 months and finally last week got it totaled. Hopefully will have a new one on order next week! The frustrating part was that I had taken delivery just 10 days prior. :/"

While driving I've been hit 3 times all within 2 weeks of buying a vehicle. None being my fault and all having to deal with red lights and people not stopping. I've been in a few others as a passenger.
"Very true!  I extend that thank you to every person who's ever worked on automobile safety.  Tesla is building of decades of work from others.  [This graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_safety_in_the_United_States#/media/File:US_traffic_deaths_per_VMT,_VMT,_per_capita,_and_total_annual_deaths.png) is an amazing culmination of so much work by so many people."
[Here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8yy3jk/my_wife_rolled_our_model_3_at_highway_speeds_she/).
Why does it matter to you?
"Most crashes at those speeds probably involve a fair bit of braking / skidding before impact, so the crash tests are probably quite relevant."
"This is how the benchmark was designed because in the larger percentage of crashes some of the speed is typically shed prior to impact either by the driver, AEBS, or other factors.

Could/Should they introduce an additional stricter standard?   Perhaps, although you may see ICE manufacturers resist implementation."
"The scary one is side impact from a pole. A shocking number of vehicles have a good chance of killing you at 25mph (admittedly, largely trucks)."
"Accidents on side streets or where one or both drivers in the accident have significantly slowed down are where car manufacturers can do the most good in terms of adding safety features and designs to vehicles.

If you're driving down the freeway at 80 and someone jumps the median right in front of you and you collide at a grand total of 160 MPH, there's not much Tesla or anyone else can do for you."
It’s a joke that plays off of our love of the car and how seeing it crushed will be painful for some.

"> Their rating data is incorrect and arguably irrelevant (or maybe just 4 years out of date?). They take points off because (according to them) the S doesn't have Automatic Emergency Breaking or knee airbags, but we know that it does.

You should probably check your facts before you call the most well respected safety testing organization of them all incorrect and irrelevant.

AEB did not arrive until late 2014, after this car was tested.

Also, it does not have (or at least didn't have) knee airbags in Europe. Apparently they removed the knee airbags because they weren't needed, but kept them in the US market because of regulations.

> Also they seem to reduce the score because the front seat doesn't have a child seat latch point even though modern safety recommendations say kids should be in the back.

Indeed it does, but what if something prevents you from putting it in the back? Why not have it on the checklist even if it's a tiny, but still valid issue? To spare the feelings of Muskbois? It's not like they lost a star over it...

> Rather than going by someones checklist of what they think is safe, I much prefer actual tests of safety features.

You do realize EuroNCAP do actual tests too, right?"
"I really dont know what to say to you sir, this is not someone's checklist they made in their free time as hobby?

&#x200B;

It is european care safety performance backed by european governments and EU. Model S is rated in the middle in that list as of 2014 is a fact, the changes you're talking about  would apply to many cars in there, it basically just questions ANY list by any agency then?

&#x200B;

I really dont get it when such standards are being put out and people try to pick holes suiting their world view? They go both ways, (that is towards other cars in those lists too?) and there is a reason it is a listed as a ranking for the year."
"> Rather than going by someones checklist of what they think is safe, I much prefer actual tests of safety features.

You mean the same thing that NHTSA does?  Just because the results don't match your view of what the results should be, doesn't mean the tests are wrong."

In SF this is considered a cheap lunch.
">$53,900

More like still $54,000 because of free lunch perk!"
For real? That's fucking expensive
I regularly put in 16+ gal at $3.00. Easy $50 right there. Sometimes I forget that modern cars can have teeny tiny gas tanks. 
These are conservative estimates in socal. 14 gallon tank at 3.50 a gallon for premium gas at Costco to fill my BMW 435i.
Cali gas is stupid expensive. 
"They could also drive a truck, I have a 37 gallon tank. If I run it right down to the line and fill 35 gallons, at 2.60 a gallon that comes out to about $90 bucks every week-week and a half depending on how much I’m driving."
Costs me $40 in LA sometimes to fill up my Civic if prices are really high... 
What's the maintenance like compared to gas cars? Is it more expensive due to the batteries and technology?
1000 miles and $200/month on fuel is 12mpg.  That's a ridiculous amount of fuel to get through for such a short journey.
"Though with a Model 3, especially with AWD, you may need to tack on another 20+ miles per day for joyrides at lunchtime.  ;)"
"And car finance 200 (smth cheap but ok) vs 500 

Amazing"
Uhm how does 200 X 12 come up to $20k/10yr in savings?
"Pretty cheap for me so far. The Tesla won't save money from a Accord, Camry or Prius. But if your shopping for a luxury car with similar MSRP to the Tesla you will save. More you drive the more you save."
No. I commute ~70 miles a day and spend <$10/week to charge.
"Nobody is arguing that. A used Prius will be cheaper. I also own a BMW 435i and it has similar MSRP to the Tesla and it is cheaper to run the Tesla by large margin. Compare the Tesla to appropriate competitive vehicles and then there is value to be seen. End of the day expensive cars are luxury purchases, don't over stretch to buy any depreciating asset but if you have the resources then get what makes you happy."
"What about safety, storage, environmentally, and fun wise?"
"Why do I feel like I've been hearing this for a few years now? 

Teslas are going to drop by $10-15k in the span of 6-8 months?"
">6-8 months away

Two or three years seems more likely. They’re not gonna drop by $15k+ by March of 2019."
Lol yeah a little bit of sarcasm I couldn’t help myself :D
"*$1,200"
"Most Americans spend closer to $1500 a year, plus there's the cost of maintenance. Oil, filters, spark plugs, batteries, brakes (electric cars slow down by using the motor to generate electricity so the brake pads are rarely used) 

So you might not break even compared to a cheap gasoline car but you'll be close."
[deleted]
"...1200?? Also no maintenance on say... oil, spark plugs"
"Spoken like a guy whose never actually counted all the money that he spends on his car, and also a guy who can’t count. "
Do they have a truck yet? I spend about $25-$50 in gas every day M-F and this would be amazing
"I'd also assume that over 5 to 10 years as the new car market goes more towards electric, less people will be wanting to buy  gas cars by then, and the electric cars sold now will fetch a premium over second hand gas cars leading to higher resale value, saving more $ in total ownership costs."
"I was comparing it to my BMW which I feed hightest and spend at about $2.5k a year (15,000ish miles a year mostly city driving)

Personally I got the $10k form the government. Compared to a BMW 3 series, it's going to be close to $0 for me if I hit 6 years."
Good point but companies are far more likely to cover charging over gas.
"In 5 years?  I've lost 6 miles in 7 years of degradation, you're completely of your rocker.   Battery life is probably in the ~20 year range based on current knowledge but with cars at half a million miles already degrading substantially less than expected it could be even longer."
160k mile tesla battery degradion is under 10% people always try to bring that point up without knowing the numbers
"Let's see. 120k miles warranty divide it by 24 miles per gallon x 3.3/gallon of premium = $16500. So if the battery cost 16500 or more and breaks exactly at 120k miles then we fucked up with the Tesla.

24 miles/gallon is generous considering the model 3 is a 4.6 second 0-60 car."
"Lol why do people keep saying this? Even the oldest Tesla batteries out there are nowhere near needing to be replaced. There are cars out there with 200,000+ miles that have only lost a few miles off their original range. Car batteries aren't like your phone. "
If a Tesla battery fails there's a huge chance it's under warranty because normal wear and tear is 1% degradation every 36000km

"Vehicles also have seatbelt pre-tensioners that will tighten your seat belt pre-crash depending on sensor inputs.

"Looks like 0.006 seconds after impact it starts expanding, it's fully inflated by 0.017 seconds... That really is incredible."
There are small sensors around the car that measure acceleration. If one of the sensors accelerates too fast they will ignite a small bit of explosive material. The resulting gas fills the airbag. Nothing in that reaction chain has any kind relevant of delay associated with it.
"There are absolutely systems that can and do detect crashes before they happen, but they don't pre-deploy airbags.  Airbags are fast enough and well enough designed that pre-deploying the airbags would not make a difference.  

A vehicle with those systems equipped will pre-tension your seatbelt, automatically apply brakes, and take other actions however.  Especially in frontal crashes, these systems make a huge difference.  

For what it's worth, these systems as deployed on production vehicles tend to rely on radar, not a camera.  Computers are pretty slow (relative to these sorts of timescales) at making that sort of judgement from a camera.  From a radar, you can tell there's a thing at a location rapidly approaching your vehicle with minimal processing overhead.  "
"They could in theory, but they won't. Even one false positive would be horrible.

The g and crush sensors in the frame are perfectly adequate for airbags. "

Most cars will activate the hazards after an airbag has been deployed. Some even do it after hard braking.

"Not really surprising: the US and the EU have different crash testing standards. French cars used to ace the European crash tests (they are not sold in the US), US cars used to ""ace"" the US tests and Germans used to be ""so-so"" in the EU and the US crash tests since they sold cars in both markets (things have moved a bit lately).
Often car makers ""optimise"" their cars to ""just get the right rating"" rather than to be as safe as possible (also ref. the reports that the Model 3 is ""overengineered and too expensively built"")"
E-Class got 5 in all three categories
I assume they are tested by the Euroncap
Or cars are just really safe nowadays?

I think under 10% scores 5 stars based on a small sample of searches.

Tesla has one major advantage for the rollover test and that is the position of the heavy battery, because it is at the lowest point of the car it is less likely to rollover.

The Model X has a higher center of gravity due to the height of the car and relatively heavy parts being so high up (falcon doors)."

Just in case you're misunderstanding, this is not the same as the current car, it will have a smaller (cheaper) battery, May not have the glass roof, will probably have cheaper interior.

If you're waiting for the cheaper version in Europe and Asia, you'll probably be waiting until they have factories producing the cars in that region. I'm predicting that the demand for the $35k version in the U.S./Canada will be so high that it will be impossible to make enough to sell in other regions without those extra factories."

"Exactly. Now if the battery costs $8,000 in 6 years, which is more likely the way battery prices are going, you saved 50%. If you don't have to replace the battery until 240k miles, you saved 75%. Then there is servicing costs. Brake pads, oil changes, etc. Then there is the cost of your time, all those trips to the gas station, as opposed to the 30 seconds or so to plug the car in at night.

Yes, Tesla still has a ways to go on the build quality, but I don't think there are that many cars with issues, we just hear about the horror stories. In about 6 months or so there will be many more people saying, ""haven't had to do a thing but plug it in at night""

Airbag and pretensioner are also incorporated on some airplane seats.
"In fact, because of how fast they go off, and how they work, pre-deploying them is actually a *bad* idea. 

When a crash happens, the airbag explodes, inflating it. Simultaneously, an explosive charge attached to the seatbelts goes off, pulling the seatbelt right around you, holding you in position for the initial moments of the crash. By the time the seatbelt relaxes, the airbag is fully inflated. As the seatbelt relaxes, you face plant into the airbag, which is now starting to deflate. You plow into it as it deflates, so that it’s not a hard surface, but rather a nice soft cushion that slows you down. 

If the bag were to predeploy, it would have collapsed too far to actually slow your face down, and it would bash against the steering wheel or dash board. 

In short, all the deployments have been carefully designed to go off exactly when they do to minimise the deceleration of the various parts of your body. Because once you’ve made the body of the can not collapse, it’s not the crash that kills you, but the inertia and sudden decelerations. 

TL:DR: Sit fully back in the seat, wear the seatbelt properly, and adjust the headrest so that you can put your head against it without bending you neck far. It could all save your life. Oh, and really, *really* [don’t crash in classic cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPF4fBGNK0U)"

u/FredTesla 
Whys that? 
There is a lot that is involved to change nhtsa ratings since its a government tests. IIHS is a consumer metric made by insurance companies so they can change their tests a lot sooner 
Looks like it did pretty well to me
"Interesting question. The 5 star rating hasnt always been around and have been changing(required rear camera for instance) . But to answer your question, do I think it's too lenient? I don't know. Some vehicles simply do not care if they get 5 stars (eg corvette) because those buyers probably don't care.  Also Safety does cost money. 

The cars where safety is a priority will probably handle the nhtsa tests easily since they perform well on the more difficult IIHS test, which BTW are not required. "
"In Detroit, being in auto isn't that exciting haha.  But it does allow for all the puns tho"
"I work for the manufacturing engineering of a German automotive company and can confirm. Before even the development of a vehicle is started the company decides what crash ratings are targeted. As we are known for our efficiency the car is developed and engineered to exactly hit that target. Nothing more, nothing less. More would mean a higher cost, which the customer would have to pay, less would mean a loss of reputation. Of course in a more prestigious segment a customer expects to have good crash ratings. In lower segments customers focus more on the price. 

I assume that either Tesla aimed for the best of the best (which is reasonable to achieve, as the competition only does as much to barely achieve 5 stars, everything else is waste) for marketing reasons. Or what we in the industry joke about is that Tesla’s young team is lacking experience and therefore have a „better safe than sorry“ engineering approach to ensure to hit the targets.

Also interesting: The circumstances of the production of those vehicles that will be tested are very tightly controlled. This means that they are very tightly observed to be manufactured under realistic conditions and not „the best results of the shift“ and then polished some more. No out of the ordinary repairs are allowed etc. You can imagine the nervousness of the production plant when they know that vehicles will be tested..."
So it should be more surprising if this car didn't get 5 stars actually.
Audi A4 as well.
What about a model in the category has the model 3?
"Then make the tests harder so cars get even safer

Edit to clarify: The crash prevention portion was more of what I was thinking of when I made the comment. I was on the bus and had to go to class.

Ideally it would test for ability to avoid crashes, stop in short distances, avoid pedestrians, and do other things to keep you and those around you safe."
The NHTSA star rating system is relative not absolute. As fleet safety improves the standards naturally rise. Cars that were rated 5 stars (risk of injury much less than average) in the past might only be 3 stars (average) today. Cars that are 3 stars today would have been 5 stars sometime in the past.
"Because of the angle that I was at when I was hit compared to him it and where it hit, most of the force transitioned into turning my car as he kept going after hitting. Had it been even slightly more squared when he hit me it would've quickly been totaled. My model 3 spun more than 180 degrees. A nearly 4,000 lb vehicle at less than 10mph requires a shit ton of force to spin that much."
"So with the trove of information you were given in just a sentence or two you decided that you had the physics of a crash completely figured out based on the damage estimate. Do you realize how stupid that sounds to act like you know anything about this crash?

"this can not be a fucking lie mate, Model S is being sold in EU and this is one of the main testing agency. To even think they would lie is FUCKED UP of you.

&#x200B;

This is how 2014 model would have been. They dont buy cars off the street to test either so Tesla would have been involved, and would have seen the results after and not just said - oh what the hell they're lying Europeans... we'l just bugger off and not worry about it.

How the hell could you even think that? that is exactly how conspiracy theorists feed their version of reality as well."
as another commenter stated thats not a blatant lie but tesla removing the airbags on the european market and the emergency braking only being introduced after the tests
That's simply not true.
"That's not entirely correct. For example a c class (3 series out next few months) will come with collision avoidance which in includes three of those. I am not sure about the lane departure but if it will be in NCAP 2018 it will also be implemented for free. 

But I give you that they only make those systems available without extra payment if the regulation ask for it."
My comment was relating to the point that I have a car that cost significantly less than any Tesla and has a 5 star crash test rating. The car hasn't changed drastically since it was introduced and still retains the 5 star rating but has since then been granted 5 stars in all category.  So yeah. 
"I think the idea is to raise the thresholds. So for example, rollover resiztance of <10% is 5 stars. If many cars are achieving that rating, then lower it to 8%. Then 6. Etc. That drives innovation"
"Okay, settle down, Derek. "
nice solution!  didn't knew that. 
"seems you missed my point. luck for the people surrounding the car that nothing happened.
i dont care which engine is safer or not.
my point is if a lithium batterie starts to burn, it won't stop. nothing else. i should stop conversation with furious fanboys.

">Tesla has one major advantage

Also they have the major advantage of not having an engine in the front, allowing a big crumple zone.

It's easier to make a safe EV."

"Not in the U.S. at least. Just small, medium and large now. If I remember right, they axed it shortly after the documentary ""Super Size Me"" came out... for obvious reasons."

At least in Western Canada."
They got rid of that term after that documentary
"i visted san fran back recently and shopped at the market inside the twitter building. I thought it was pretty decent but holy fuck was it expensive  (like $10 for a jar of pickles expensive) . So I looked up an article about the place and there was quote in it saying ""we want to make an upscale whole foods"".

I was like ""oh thank god, im so sick of that low class whole foods and wish I could go somewhere to light my money on fire even faster"".

I had other issues with the city, like seeing people shoot up and smoke crack all over the place nearly every day i was there, but wow is it pricey .  A burrito off a taco truck was $15 (and thats  before square tries to guilt you into a $3 tip). I don't doubt at all that whole foods is a less expensive option for lunch, especially following the amazon acquisition. "
"In general it's much more expensive to live in California than the increase in pay. It's a nice place to live but the Cost of Living in a city like LA, SF, or San Diego is often 200+% of what it would be in the Midwest or South and believe me salaries are not double what they would be there."
But I'd expect for the first 4/8 years (limited/power train warranties)  Tesla will eat most of the servicing costs.

I'd rather save 20k on gas than 5k on repairs. Also there's no transmission or 1000piece engine in it so there's that also.
"i would only ever lease an electric

shits too new, im not paying for it after warranty expires"
"I get what your saying and mostly agree but it's actually been a marketing campaign and an often quoted statistic that buying a BMW is financially a sound decision because it's, say, 10 year cost of ownership is lower than some other ""cheaper"" made cars that you could purchase, keep 10 years, and have a lot of costly repairs done on.   


I drive 33k miles a year for work. I require an AWD car to be able to safely get to work during all 4 seasons. A model 3 may not ""save"" money, but I was very surprised that over a long term forecast I was able to reach cost-parity with a, say, Subaru Legacy sedan.   


Of course the Model 3 wins in that scenario.   


  
I could not afford an equal priced competitor to the Model 3 if it was a gas vehicle. Like a 55k Audi A4 AWD car would not work for me. The money I spend on the car + fuel would be outside my budget.   


Bu the Model 3 is very close to my ""regular car"" payment + gas each month. "
"You sir, know nothing of cars apparently. "
I thought petrol was about $3 over there?
"So your post is misleading. The $24k figure in savings is in 10yrs, not every year. "
"Sure why not? I own a BMW 435i and a Model 3 and think they can be compared. Both have similar MSRPs and features. The Model X can be compared to an Audi Q7, Mercedes GLE etc and the Model S stacks up with a BMW 5, Audi A6/A7, Lexus GSF"
"Midwest, yes."
"The standard range will be around 200, supposedly. The long range one is said to be 300 but realistically you only use like 260 before wanting to charge it. (You usually don't fill to 100%).

The actual battery charge levels are 50 and 75 kWh I think."
What would you do when you're supply constrained and you can either sell $60k cars or $35k cars?
"Aha, was gonna add *unless you mean some sort of select model. Lol "
"It also depends on the country. I know most people here are American, but where I live in British Columbia, Canada, gas is expensive ($1.40 CAD/liter or $4.09 USD/gallon)and electricity is cheap. (8-10 cents a kilowatt CAD / 6-8 cents USD) which is why there are so many electric cars here.

So charging a 50 kW battery is almost exactly 1/10th of the price of filling up a 40-litre gas tank."
No but a Tesla doesn't even have those. While you'll change them 2-3 times in 10yr
A year sure.
"... this conversation chain is based on free charging at work, fyi"
If you change like yourself and don’t require synthetic oil or an oil filter then yeah it’ll be a little over $20. Need synthetic and a filter? $35-50. Having a professional do it? $69-99. Spark plugs are about $20 for all of them if you know how to replace them which most don’t. So you’re looking at $100-150.
Nothing cited conclusively because it's charge cycles that wear them down not time. Which is why it is measured in km and not years
"10 year old Tesla batteries have had no noticeable difference in degradation, miles seem to be the only real impact."
Where I live it's about 6-7 times cheaper to fill so add a 15% margin on the miles.
Not free if you don't follow elons master plan. I have solar on my roof so my charging is 100% free.
"That's the thing about efficiency, it works both ways.   Efficient drivetrains put more horsepower on the ground per kW of power at full throttle, and last longer per kW at partial throttle.  It's not even an electric quirk - gas cars are also going up in both horsepower and MPG as they get more efficient.  "
"Two things...

1. If you don't push the go pedal as far it can go, you can reduce that 0-60 number to as low as you like.  It could be 20 seconds... but having the option is nice for say, passing on a highway.  If you drive it like that... it will go much, much further on a charge.

2. ""I'd rather have something that could last a day on a single charge"".  You do know these things get 220 or 310 miles on a full battery right.  Not sure about you... but for me, with the smaller battery (22 miles), that means I'll get almost 2 weeks (about 13 days) on a single charge."
Just trying to be objective here but could it be said that the depreciation of the Tesla will be more at 240k miles? Especially considering newer/better battery technology will be available in the coming years 
">""Our philosophy with respect to service is not to make a profit on service""- Elon

He says that, but [this guy](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/28/tesla-owner-frustrated-so-fixes-his-own-model-s-easy-as-legos.html) had an estimate of over $12k in repairs as soon as he went out of warranty. That seems peculiar."
How many cars have broken door handles? Hahah you must not have been around many Tesla’s. They will all break and are $1000 each
Lol you had to say door handles. 
How to make your brand new car look like shit?
"They're alloy wheels.  [Here's what they look like](https://shop.tesla.com/content/dam/tesla/CAR_ACCESSORIES/MODEL_3/WHEELS_TIRES/1458216-00-A_0.jpg) underneath, though you'll need to buy [a $50 kit from Tesla](https://shop.tesla.com/us/en/product/vehicle-accessories/model-3-aero-wheel-cap-kit.html) for the lugnut covers and center cap with Tesla logo."
"No, they are alloy wheels underneath. No steel wheels on any Tesla no matter how you order.

Theyre spokes. They look so much better too.
"Really? I've never heard of either on planes.

Or is it only non-commercial?"
WTF I have a '17 Canyon with the same airbag system and didn't know about this.
Oof
"Great video, thanks "
"The shit performance of a good portion of those underride guards just pisses me off so much. What, did you save $10 on thicker steel tubing? Good for you, fuck yourself. Those trailers should be banned from the road if they can't build a proper guard. "
"Battery is lighter, and the Model 3 also has a more narrow wheeltrack width: 62.2in in front and rear, while the Model S has 65.4in front and 66.9in rear. 3.2 inches front and 4.7 inches rear difference, or 5% wider wheel track width in front and 7.55% wider wheel track width in rear. They both still perform really well! "
Iirc it’s the only SUV with 5 star rollover rating
"It’s pretty funny to watch, it rolls on its roof but corrects itself."
"From NHTSA:

""One star would represent a Static Stability Factor (SSF) corresponding to a 40 percent or greater risk of a single-vehicle crash resulting in rollover, while five stars would represent an SSF corresponding to a risk of less than 10 percent. Static Stability Factor is one-half the track width of a vehicle divided by the height of its center of gravity. ""

Basically it's a pure dimensional calculation, correlated to risk of rollover in any crash derived from empirical data."
Yeah I put this up in 2 minutes before leaving for a test drive. Sorry about that . It should be updated soon. 
because it's a recursive linkfest to other Electrek articles and almost never a link clearly sending you to a source outside Electrek.
bc Fred is an insecure little man who cannot handle even the smallest bit of criticism on his writings from people. Deletes comments and outright blocks people who question him.
"Thanks for your post! Enjoyed reading it. To me it shows that the industry is really not about big leaps forward but to slowly optimise results by iterating over existing approaches until the last cent of costs has been cut... (and then cut some more!)

> Or what we in the industry joke about is that Tesla’s young team is lacking experience and therefore have a „better safe than sorry“ engineering approach to ensure to hit the targets.

I think there is too much cynicism in the German car industry. I have not ever spoken to anybody working at any of the big German car makers (incl. suppliers like Bosch, Conti & Co.) that has a genuinely positive / forward looking / enthusiastic approach to their work. Pretty much everyone seems somehow ""trapped"" in the enormous pressure for cost, market share, revenue targets. So I sometimes have the suspicion that there is an intensive search to find out what ulterior motive / incapacity / inability caused Tesla to do something that's unique and not fitting the standard industry practice... (all IMO).
"
"Depends on what they get in Europe (i.e. what the optimised for ;-) - then again, I know from Model S / X that they don't do the usual ""optimisation"" i.e. we try to get away with the minimum while still getting great marks.

I think there is an old engineering joke that goes like this: anybody can build a bridge that doesn't collapse. It takes an engineer to build a bridge that *just* doesn't collapse... I guess this is the approach with many car makers :)"
"Model 3 is considered in the same category as the 3 series BMW, c class Benz, and Audi A4. AFAIK the A4 has top rating in all categories. "
That's a mid sized car.
"Does that really make sense?  At some point, the government would be preventing the sale of perfectly acceptible vehicles for irrelevant safety considerations. "
Isn't this... how giraffes got them tall necks?
"Why? For all intents and purposes cares are insanely safe, just look at something like the xc90 which isn't five stars in all categories and literally has never had anyone die in it in Britain since it was introduced in 2002 http://www.thedrive.com/news/20203/report-the-volvo-xc90-has-never-had-a-fatal-crash-in-britain

Edit: now where you might have a point is something like a standardized test for crash prevention technologies because that's going to save a lot more lives than making a car slightly safer to crash in. "
[deleted]
And unnecessarily expensive.
Then we get tanks with terrible gas mileage.
Today I learned something new! 
That probably cut down the acceleration to experienced a lot. Good to hear you came out safe. 
So you got y-boned.
I initially just imagined a traditional t-bone hitting the middle of the car. A pickup doing that to a car that weighs 2000lbs less at 60 mph would be absolutely brutal. He would not have walked away from the wreck nor would there be any debate about the car being totaled. Now we find out it was a glancing blow to the rear. Speed up for debate. 
">	If you are fault in an accident, should your car disable all safety features? What the hell, man?

Where did you get that from?

I thought it was strange they didn’t know who caused it. He said she can’t remember the accident which is pretty uncommon.."
"Not weighing in one way or another, but the stat we need is how many models were tested, and how many got a 5-star in every category *and sub category*.  For instance the 2017 Volt [only got 4-stars](https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2017/CHEVROLET/VOLT/5%252520HB/FWD#safety-ratings-frontal) in the front passenger side subcategory."
"And yet only the Tesla Model 3 is lowest probability of injury of any vehicle the NTHSA has ever tested.

https://electrek.co/2018/10/07/tesla-model-3-lowest-probability-of-injury-nhtsa/"
"Yeah but not all 5 stars are the same, you have to look at the raw injury rate number (or the actual crash video). NHTSA hasn't released that yet for Model 3, but it has a shot at having the lowest injury rate of any car. At least it was designed that way."
Plz share then
"I'm going by the NHTSA website, I'm not speculating based on what the manufacturer is claiming their future vehicle features will include.  BMW didn't even include a back-up camera until it was required by law this year."
"That was the idea, yeah.  Hard to speak at all these days without someone getting triggered."
"If you don't like statistics, then you don't care about reality.

The ICE car reality is:

>in the United States from 1977 to 2016. In 2016, there were 1,342,000 fires reported in the United States. These fires caused 3,390 civilian deaths.

Petrol cars are dangerous.

Now, why don't you tell me the stats for EVs?"

"Well, there's the battery, but I'm uneducated on Tesla battery deterioration or how that's dealt with financially. From what I've heard, Tesla *repairs* are not cheap, but normal maintenance isn't even a thing. There's no oil to change, air filters to replace (except the cabin air filter on most cars, how does that work with Tesla?), and the physical brakes are rarely used except in hard braking situations, as the car uses regenerative braking to recharge the battery and the brake pads aren't touched for that."

"More depreciation than what? An ICE car? Another EV? 

Consider that the replacement battery could incorporate the newer technology.

How much do you expect any car to be worth at 250k miles?"
Not surprised given that it's a luxury car built by a company new to the business. No one's even talked about the elephant in the room that is how bad the paint texture is on brand new cars. Compare that to cars in its price range and it's a travesty how bad it is. 
"Yeah the fact that he can't get a service manual is weird to me. I can get Toyota service manuals if I really look. They are out there. Toyota certifies mechanics outside of dealerships. Having no secondary part market and wanting all Tesla repairs to go through service centers... Honestly, how many service centers are there? Certainly not enough. Not everyone lives on the coasts. Even that guy lived on the coast of Seattle and had a long fucking drive to a Tesla service center. If they won't Ranger out to an island off the coast of Seattle they sure aren't going to be fixing shit in Kentucky or something."
">  They will all break and are $1000 each

$50 with labor now.  They used to sell the whole door handle, motor, controller electronics, and all of the rest as 1 assembly.  Now they sell pieces.   There are 2 potential failures in the S doors:  the paddle gear  and the microswitch.  The gear costs $1.28 and the switch costs $5.  Do all 4 doors  yourself for $20 and an hour of your time or pay someone else for their time, but if you're paying $1000 you're living in the past.

The new $1.28 gear is finally a stronger revision finally, also.  They updated the parts when they started making them individually."

In the end the customer does not necessarily want sharper radii of stamped parts, tighter panel gaps, no visible weld spots, etc. but they would rather want a motherfucking rad electrical supermachine that can drive itself.

"Doesn't look like the X6 has been rated by the NHTSA, but [the X5](https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2018/BMW/X5/SUV/AWD) received a 4-star rollover rating at 18.80%."
"https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2018/VOLVO/XC90%252520T6/SUV/AWD#safety-ratings-rollover

17.90% rollover, 4 stars

EDIT: Maybe you're thinking of the Model X internal testing video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L24xzJkCGdk

IIRC they had to design their own test to get it to roll over, the normal test wasn't effective enough."

"You seem to be referring to modding Electrek.

The comment you are responding to is mostly like discussing Fred's modding of this sub.

(Fred had an ad-supported Tesla blog, then became a mod of this sub, then switched to writing for Electrek as his full-time job)"
"Still made a good point. Fred really gets hurt when people don't love what he writes. And also just copies stories he reads on reddit. 

Like how Bjorn gets mad if there are any downvotes on his video. People need to just calm down and realize they're not perfect and not everyone needs to like what they do. "
"I like Electrek, too, but the guy above you is right. Any time Fred comes into a Reddit comment section, he begins acting like a child and can't take even an ounce of criticism."
I haven't personally been affected. But I've seen countless instances of him trying to censor people with valid criticisms conveyed in a professional manner. That was enough for me. 
on Electrek.
I'm currently looking for a job in the german automotive field and this simultaneously scares me and makes me happy. German cars will fall and stay behind Tesla until this younger Generation has replaced the older decisionmakers I'm afraid :/

Huh?  I'm just asking for some data that I wasn't able to find myself to try and contextualize how impressive this is.

"Hamburger is still $.89, and this is useful in Quebec because hamburger is hamburger in French."
Those nuggets though.  Holy shit did they do a flip on their pricing. It’s like a dollar for 5 now or something. 
God damn it. I even know it’s not actually a dollar I am just so used to calling it that. 
And a cheeseburger. Fries are actually more than a dollar though. 
"I don't think it was - at least not back in the day when it was an actually advertised option.  It was a ""new"" thing introduced as a size even larger than the standard small, medium, and large.  At least, that's how I remember it."
EDIT: Holy shit there was an extra large in the US that was almost a 2 litre size bottle of pop.  😦
"I can vouch for the lack of needing to hit the brakes.  Just today I did a little joyride on some winding mountain roads, and I didn't need to touch the brake pedal even *once* until I got to a stop sign.  This is with gunning it wherever I could, yet slowing down rapidly to take every blind turn very safely.  Gingerly passed bicyclists at half the speed limit, then shot forward when clear, and a few seconds later slowed down again for the next turn.

And somehow the trip still came in at 264 Wh per mile!"

"I think that's highlighting his point about drinking the flavor-aid.  People look at the electronics and say they're ""streamlined and integrated."" Ok, good, but what exactly does that mean, that they *look* cool? How does that translate into the reality of what components are on the board, how they're assembled, and how robust the designs are? It doesn't. Not even a little. You can't - ever- just *glance* at packaged electronics, especially without specialized domain knowledge (and even then) and make an informed comment about its reliability. One big box full of electronics (hypothetically, this doesn't describe the Tesla) is not automatically better or more reliable than a bunch of smaller boxes connected by cables. "
"I don't think that was /r/JCuc's point. He/she is pointing out people who are driving bread and butter vehicles (toyotas/hondas/chevys) are saying they will be cheaper to own which may be true because of its fuel source, but everything else that has to be serviced will be at a premium and must take place at the service center. It doesn't help that they're taking the apple approach when it comes to repairs and parts."

I just got a new Dell with battery management in the BIOS so like my car I can tell it to charge to 80% maximum, and to discharge for 6 hours every day so the battery isn't held at a steady % for months at a time.   They're learning from their mistakes by watching how cars are making lithium last forever.   It turns out sitting at 100% forever is *bad*."

"Miles.  My daily commute to the workshop is about 40 miles, and if I need to pop over to our main ""office"" that's about another 40 or 50 depending on which way I go around Glasgow.

"Not trying to defend them, but dealing with trolls all day wears on you. They have every right to delete fake new from their publications."
Now I kinda want to downvote a bjorn video.
Is this heresay or do you have proof of specific comments?  Honestly curious. Wouldn’t expect that. I’d think other commenters can defend topics themselves. I’d hope there’d be a legitimate reason.
"Hm, I wouldn‘t necessarily say that they are doomed to fail. Most of them, if not even all of them, are electrifying their portfolios. I think it‘s realistic that they will be able to compete but it‘s my personal assessment that they have been resting on milking the conventional car cash cow due to heavy backing of national politics. 

My personal prediction is that we will see some surprises on the market. The big ones like VW, BMW and Daimler are producing weird niche products in the EV segment that nobody can really imagine buying. I think the race in Europe will be defined by the ones not making a big deal out of it who just start building normal, practical and affordable electric cars. This is happening and surprised me, tbh,

As soon as this mentality kicks in, I can imagine the big German names will follow and could be able to dominate again. Building cars efficiently and profitably has a lot to do with good global supply chain management, platform development, parts sourcing, quality management, keeping track of future regulations, etc. It’s a huge endeavour which is hard to replicate and which we happen to be really good at. You can see how Tesla has been struggling with all that and they have an excellent team and numerous backing investors.

The biggest risks are IMO the Chinese manufacturers and autonomous Taxi fleets. Large scale adaption of the latter would curb-stomp individual car ownership and hit sales hard, as much fewer cars would be needed to transport the same amount of people. And the Chinese are already manufacturing lots of EVs and have the advantage of cost-leadership. As soon as the prestige-factor of cars wear off, more people would consider buying a “no-name“ brand."
What original post?
"Really in netherlands a hamburger is 1,50 (i think) and with the current currency of is $1,76 .... I am being robbed"

That's correct.  There were 4 size options.
Supersize fries came in a box the size of my forearm (wrist to elbow) so like a double large.
It was perceived as extra large by some but it was more of a medium size compared to what the large had become. 
That sounds like heaven. Would love to own a Tesla one day and I’m sure prices will go down with more competition and all that
"$3.41 across the street here in Vancouver, WA. I used a national average. How come we gotta pay so much over here on the west coast?"
"In the Bay Area, I can get a great deal for gas at Costco at $3.30/gal for regular.

Though wow you're putting on a lot of miles.  My commute is > 50 miles/day and I was only hitting about $200/mo with my old Camry (under 25mpg).  Looking at your flair, I hope you get your Tesla soon!"
"Do you drive a car engine that benefits/is required to use premium gas? If not, you should do some light research into whether it's even beneficial to use the higher priced gas option. In most cases, it's pointless."
"Their fleet's reliability is actually now rather average: https://www.consumerreports.org/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/tesla-model-s-model-3-reliability/

They have made big improvements with each passing year. The Model 3 is their simplest vehicle yet. It's far simpler than any comparable vehicle."

"No problem. I am a petrolhead but I admit that electric cars have a legit role and the more we adapt to it the faster we can pour money into R&D to get them to a more sustainable place

Most of the cost is that huge lump of aluminum that is the physical door handle itself - the piece that is nearly impossible to break.
"True, but I think the biggest factor is the battery pack weight on the Model X, it's so low in the car that it's nearly impossible to roll it over."
"Yup. I'd do that too - for some topics the amount of bullshit is so huge that it's easier to just to delete everything that appears to be crap. Unfortunately that means that sometimes you also delete comments you shouldn't, but hey - if your sanity depends on it, I'm all for it. A lot of people should grow a thicker skin if deleting a comment offends them so much - they're at that moment doing exactly what they're blaming the other person for.

I mean, it does hurt if someone doesn't think your comment is worth anything, but that's just life.

(Personally I think most sites shouldn't have comment sections at all anymore; they just contribute nothing and reduce the brand value of any site. Come to reddit if you want to talk about news :-)"
Exactly my thoughts! Haha. Where can I find some?
"Here's one instance i remember clearly.

Some Google'ing will yield more results."
"I don't think german automakers will fail, just that they have to catch up for so long, that most people don't want to wait for them to be on par with tesla and then buy from somewhere else. I'm curious why the Chinese Brands don't seem to expand into other markets, or maybe i'm just uninformed? 🤔"
What do you mean? Go re-read his comment. He mentions he posted a while back so I checked it out. I even quoted it. And then you responded to that.. Are you really having that much trouble following this?

Food production in the US is pretty heavily subsidized by their government. Food can sometimes be bought after the final retail markup for less than the cost of production.

"Now I understand why the default color on his cars is black.

What are thoOoOoSe?!
Elon kind of looks like Conan. 
I wonder how it feels like working there knowing that your boss is there. 
He looks so tired :(
Does he have security? Big dudes with earpieces and no necks? He's pretty famous now. Certainly paper rich. I want him safe. Earth needs Elon
He stay dressed in all black like my homies
Looks like young Elon to the right and current Elon in the middle 
I would shit myself 
4 words for ol' Elon | FUCK ALL THE HATERS | this is beautiful photo
Elon is going for then knight rider look I think when is the KITT update coming 
The fucking man.  My hero!  
He does look pretty wild. Look at that hair.
I always forget how tall he is.
"Wow. He kinda looks like a mad scientist. I love him and everything he’s doing, but he needs to sleep and take care of himself. Get some rest and take a vacation, Mr Musk!!"

What do I do with my hands? -Elon
"He is so f-bomb ing tall...

EDIT: he looked taller what i thought when standig next to those guys :P"
You ever been to a Tesla showroom... on WEED???
Looks like he is testing out Auto Pilot on himself 
He looks like he needs a few more joints...
Driving a car in flipflops is stupid.
Must have had a rough day in court
Is that the YouTube guy? 
Oh man he looks co platelet depleted 😭
Are you guys high?
"Man, he’s the only billionaire that I feel bad for. He has aged significantly in the past few years."
Lets see it!
Slimming and you focus on the person/face. More memorable. IMO
Because the car looks awesome in black.
Johnny Cash
"Because once you go black, you never go back.

Unless you get Multicoat Red."
"This is classic behavior of entrepreneurs. They feel they can only make so many decisions in a day, so wearing the same thing illuminates the need for a decision in the morning.   Hence, one less decision to make.   "
"As someone who wears a lot of black, it's just laziness. Black goes with everything so you don't have to worry about matching a bunch of different colors or clashing."
"From what I understand, it’s also the easiest to paint match thus making it cheaper for them to do. "
Black is the colour that's the least wrong.
Can anyone reverse engineer what he is wearing with links? 
Black is also just kind of “in” right now.
Looks like the Fremont delivery center where I was today!! Can’t believe I missed him. 😭😭
"Read somewhere that this is the reason, why tall people can sit quite comfortable in Teslas. And he got lots of kids -> reason why there is a 7 seated Model S and X."
Never realized until that photo of his personal delivery how big he was. He seems to be slouching in this photo.
Cool story bro
He's looking way better now
"He works crazy hours and is going to be 50 soon, I think he looks good.
"
Yea a few weeks ago he did a factory walk through and looked like shit. Looks like he’s lost some weight and caught up on some sleep maybe. Glad to see this man looking healthy again
You meant the Musk ball.......that sounds so wrong!
"That was literally my first thought and I was like, nah that’s too dorky even for Reddit "
A cheery Elon is a preferable Elon 
Once the Q3 over I hope he has good long rest with his friends and family. He really earned it
He doesn't look very tired to me. But he looks unfit and pale. A lot would improve with a some workout and moderate sun exposure.
"Uhh, he looks totally fine to me..."
Hair plugs are pricey.
"If you've got 10-20k, anybody can have the cure for baldness. It's surprisingly affordable. "
"Stress will do that anybody, looked at all the U.S president before and after their term"
He doesn’t look like 60 to me. 
"Also lack of sleep induces weight gains... If he drops a few pounds in the next weeks, then that means he sleeps better and maybe Tesla is in a ore secure position..."
Drugs?
"Man, if you know it's going to be a bad financial decision, *don't* do it. Just wait until you can afford it. Who knows, by then the Tesla vehicles could be much more advanced.

Alternatively, you could do what I'm doing. Instead of making monthly Tesla payments, I use a comparable amount of money and make TSLA stock purchases for the long-haul. Of course, investing isn't for every one, but it's an option (if you can stomach the volatility)."
"He's like 6ft 1. 

That is not _that_ tall. "
Ever been to Northern Europe?  He is not tall.  Just normal.
Half Baked reference. Jon Stewart.
Why would we be high exactly?

Wasn’t he bald before being a billionaire??
"I think that's your perception. Elon is like a kid, doing what he loves in life, knowing he's making the world a better place. The Boring Company is an example. The company started out as a joke, then became a reality. They sold 20,000 flame throwers this past summer. It was a play on one of Musk's favorite movies: Spaceballs. They had a flame thrower party complete with mariachi band. Elon is working hard, but he's still very creative and having fun. If you're still having fun, you're not growing old. Also, I'm 48, Musk is 47. He does not look like he's aged prematurely at all."
"That's mostly aging though, he looked very young into his 40s. I think he looks great for his age."
"I think he looks great, especially considering everything that’s happened the last few months"
"To me his billions look more like a side effect of what he's doing, not a life goal definitely."
It'll be fine when they finish his robot body.
"I feel bad for Larry Page's vocal cord problems

Also looks older than Elon even though he's younger"
He's also almost 50 years old.
Have you seen him before he became rich?
but look at his hair! (compared to when he was 30.. he must have done something)
Yeah dude......gotta go with more indica dominant strains after dark.
"He still looks 10 years younger than he looked 15 years ago, before he was a billionaire."
Nah he just looks a bit puffy. 
"Grew his hair back, though ... ;-)"

"Yeah, nature really has its way of proving that money can't fix everything."
But still he aged fast. He looked so much healthier just a few years ago.
I want to know his secret. I need it.
Understood completely.  I am jealous though...

"If that is not illegal in the US, then you should blame the law, not a company taking advantage of it. Oh and BTW this union, forgot their name, had a few scandals lately, too. "
"This is also the point in most people's lives where aging is particularly noticeable, regardless of what you're going through in life.

"I don't know for sure, but I think they just transplated some of the hairs (including their roots) from the side to the bald areas. That is what I know about, nothing too dramatic.

does this mean the part that has transplanted hair will keep growing when other part start to go bald too?

We're not supposed to talk about the drugs here.
"Yeah. Only the transplanted hair is safe from going bald really. Most men keep some of the hair on top of the scalp though, which makes transplanting with good lasting result easier."
"Not true. Transplanted hair is hair that isn't affected by balding. 

BUT- people who get transplants often aren't finished going bald, so you will continue to lose the hair you were going to lose anyway unless you take medication. The transplanted hair is for life though. "

"A 1914 model T, and a 2018 Model 3"
"The interesting thing about the model t, that a lot of people don't know, is how incredibly cheap they were. In 1925 they were $260. In today's money, that would be about $3,800. I really wish you could buy something like this today. A four-passenger street-legal car for under $4k new"
"A while back I was hoping the upcoming“3rd generation” Tesla would be called the T — 1st was the **R**oadster, 2nd Model **S**, then **T** would be next in the alphabet.   Then the X came along and I found out he was going another way. 🙂"

[Detroit Tesla Model T from 1919 shown charging](https://www.treehugger.com/cars/detroit-electric-car-charging-home-1919.html)
"Wonder what Henry Ford would say, if one could show him a Model 3."
"Adapt a Model 3 powertrain to a Model T, and you get a crazy ride.  Also probably the *un*safest car in the world..."
I love this shot! How far we’ve come. 
dat leather interior in the model T tho
"Henry Ford: you can have your car any color you want as long as its black!

Elon Musk: you can have your car any color for free as long as it’s black!"
Love the look of the model t 😍
S 3 X T
This is really motivating me to finish my dodge d100 restoration. . Want that d100 100d pic.
"Pretty crazy to think that in a century we've come from the Model T to a consumer electric car that can steer itself and drive 300 miles with no gasoline.

Now if only we could make the 3 as affordable as the T. Someday maybe."
I'd like to see how many years Henry Ford would guess were between those two vehicles.
So when are you gonna get a group photo to do S3XT?
Only two car companies that haven’t gone bankrupt!
The irony is that we haven't come as far as you'd think in 100+ years: some of the first car prototypes were powered by electric motors...
"Awesome photo!!! 

Great juxtaposition:
* the car that radically changed the world last century, and
* the car that will radically change the world this century!!!

Congratulations."
Super cool! In the end they are both effective point A to point B transportation. 
You managed to find a shot where the model 3 is not the coolest car in the frame. Model T is amazing.
"Dude, i just watched the Henry Ford documentary on Amazon Prime. That guy was a fucking douchebag, man. "

Omg thats awesome

Good shot to show the kids. I can’t fathom what the next 100 years will bring.
Model T and Model T(hree)
"Well, don't keep us in suspense!  Which one's which?"
Shame it wasn't exactly 100 years apart.
A 1914 Model T Ford with wire wheels? Aren't they supposed to be wooden spoked wheels?  
"Honestly, you probably could produce a Model T for about $4,000 today if you made it in China and didn't embellish the design at all. "
"See: [https://www.gilderlehrman.org/content/statistics-american-economy-during-1920s](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/content/statistics-american-economy-during-1920s)

The link above says that the average household earnings in 1924 was $1,303, making the model T about 22% of average salary.

Median household income today is $61,372.  As a percentage of salary, this would be equal to a $13,500 car.  A Ford Fiesta is listed at $14,260, but can be found new for less than $13,500.

&#x200B;"
"Sure, 4K new if you wanted a car that would kill you in a accident of its top speed of 40mph. "
To be compared with 1925 wages too!
"Well yeah, they were incredibly basic machines back then."
"Except that the Model T wouldn't be legal to produce today as a new car.  

It would be more realistic to compare the Model T to a modern quad or ATV, and you *can* buy one of those for a few grand today."
"That’s cause they didn’t have to include air bags, A/C, or a 15” LCD on the dashboard"
"You might need to compare average wage though. The average daily wage for agricultural workers was $2.30. Also no; a/c, disk brakes, air bags, power steering, electric windows, seatbelts, heated rear window, interior heater, traction control, sat nav and heated seats. But you would get a high wheel base to drive down cart tracks, leaf springs, the joys of starting with a starting handle and advancing / retarding the timing as you drive. So a cheap car you would not be sell as it would not pass regulations."
"You can also still get a t in a relatively  good shape for  10k. Really fun experience, if you ever get  the opportunity  drive one it's a blast!"
Gas golf cart slightly used? Probably similar in price and features. Haha
Yup the model T started car modification culture and the model 3 is trying to end it.
He can't for copyright reasons. The 3 was originally going to be called the model E but ford wouldn't let them. If they can't use model E they definitely can't use model t
Tesla is about a century younger though. Bit of an advantage 
">From the sole two US companies which didn't file for bankruptcy.

The only two companies in the entire US that never filed for bankruptcy? Wowee"
"Not really a fair comparison because Tesla got [bailed out by Mercedes-Benz's parent company](http://www.teslaupdates.co/2016/06/elon-musk-thanks-daimler-and-toyota-for.html) (Which is why the OG Electric Smart car had a Tesla drivetrain) to the tune of $50 million at the very last moment, and a [Department of Energy grant of $465 million](https://techcrunch.com/2009/06/23/the-government-comes-through-for-tesla-with-a-465-million-loan-for-its-electric-sedan/) a little later after that.

Tesla would not have survived if Daimler didn't throw cash at them and the DoE grant let them design/build the Model S. "
Never knew about this. Thanks.
"What goes around, comes around. Every time someone says that ‘EVs are not a mature tech’ I have to prove that the first automobiles were, in fact, electric. Plus electric motors are in *everything*, these are just scaled to size. "
He’d probably be irritated it doesn’t say ford on the front of the 3. 
He prefers his 'airy' wheel design.
Closest person to ask would be Bob Lutz.
He would think it was manufactured poorly 
"Well the paint cost is really built into the cost of the car, so not free at all. Just doesn't cost extra to paint a different color."

Too bad we won’t be around to see it!
Tata Nano costs about that much and I think a couple of Chinese cars have a similar price.
"Though of course, if no one had to take on debt to buy a car the economy would be worse off."
"When the model T was introduced it sold for $825 but average salary was $300... per year. 

http://www.orangepower.com/threads/life-in-1910-100-years-ago.96681/"
"4k car is theoretically possible with ai doing all the work from a-z , from processing raw minerals,design to manufacturing..."
Nah man most modern ATVs are over $10k and are far more advanced than the model T. A better comparison would be a riding lawnmower.
1337 5P34K is better anyways.
"Yes, we'll see how it works out in the next, hum, 85 years."
Auto companies. 
Arr damn me!
"That's true. Ford also received funds from the government. They also secured investments at the very last minute from other sources, Jurvetson has narrated it several times. Startup auto company + 2007-8 financial crash and recession then was not gentle."
"And many modern railway networks run on electricity as well. Scaling the motors was never the problem. Nor was the range of the cars, as long as you kept the speed down.

The real problem is going there at great speed. Energy losses go up exponentially if you increase speed (no matter if it's EV or ICE). Frankly, building a car with 1000+ miles range is quite possible given todays tech, as long as people are willing to spend 20 hours to get to their destination and are fine with just opening the window a tad and enjoying fresh air instead of turning the AC down to freezing temps."
I think Tesla should make a car with 3 propulsion units and call it a [Ford Tri-motor](https://putinbayreservations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/7-23-16-960-Ford-Tri-Motor-NC80407-EAA-0013.jpg).

Speak for yourself!
What else did they tell you?
"That is a strange thing to say, debt is a good thing. Consumer credit has supported the US auto industry as they make revenue on lending to people who can’t pay cash. But can you tell me why consumer debt is a good thing for the economy as there must be a part of economics I know nothing about?"
"Wow, the average earnings nearly doubled from 1916 to 1924.  When the Model T came out, it was certainly unattainable to the average person, as it cost more than their yearly earnings."
"You get $4000 cars in india before taxes and registration, that aren’t going to kill you on your first, or even your 1000th ride in it... "
"I don't know jack about ATVs, so I just googled Yamaha and ATV and got this one for under $3k.

"They're making a car with 3 motors, and they're calling it the Roadster 2"
"Because it needs Service Centers and comes in multiple colors. The original T was designed to be (nearly) entirely self-service, which kept TCO down and the company didn't need to own or lease a huge fleet of tow trucks."

"The 2009 model was the original Roadster, the one built into the Lotus body."
"Yea, my point is there is a reason why no one pays the ""national debt"" off for example."
"The lotus body roadster has 

* 1.0 from 2006
* 1.5 from 2007
* 2.0 from 2009
* 2.5 from 2010
* 3.0 from 2014

The coming fresh roadster is 2020 not 2.0.

See https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/differences-in-roadster-versions.8569/#post-140400 or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster_(2008)#Technical_data and and https://www.tesla.com/blog/roadster-30 and even https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-initiates-voluntary-recall-after-single-customer-incident

The old roadster used up 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 already. So clearly the new roadster won't be Roaster 2.0 or Roaster 2 or anything similar"

Love the car! Taken two of my vehicles on road trips down the PCH and taken photos in the exact same spot. I think it’s probably one of the most photogenic off the side of the road spots.
"Have you been to the nepenthe restaurant before? It's about 20 minutes south I believe, amazing food man!"
I hate you!
Is it odd that i know exactly where this is?
"I'm planning on a road trip from Austin, TX  to California and up the PCH in December. Can't wait!"
Since I got mine I’ve been having a real problem. For some reason all the other cars on the road have slowed down and are always in the way...
Thank you for the positive post about this car. New technology is scarey for the mass populous to embrace. More posts and feed back like this is how we curb that. Enjoy your new lady!
"Wow. Have to admit: that's a stunning color, esp against the ocean. 

Congrats and enjoy!"
Let me guess then your battery died and you were stranded there. Go Gas man.
Any nervousness around charging? Was thinking of doing a similar trip but didn’t see any Superchargers nearby...
Jelly.
My favorite city
Is there a color that’s easier to touch up if you get knocks on the bumpers etc?  
So is this thing pretty friggin quick? Does it have the “insane mode”?
Don't get married
"I did that drive over the weekend, amazing drive! Congrats"
So jealous. Just had decline my P3D+ over major factory paint issues as well as scratches during delivery.
"Nice car, sorry about the fog"
the perfect drive and road!!!
Gorgeous car and a beautiful view. I’m jealous op
Just don't drive in any rain or the bumper might fall off.
"Wow goals. The last and only time I was at Big Sur, my friends and I got out of the car, looked at the view, then hopped back on the road lol. "
"Completely off topic, but WTH… have they re-opened PCH up to Monterey?  That rock slide looked rather nasty with no notice of how long it was going to take to fix."
"beautiful, how convenient/inconvenient was supercharging along that stretch of coast?"
Pretty little liars bridge in the background
How much did you pay for it in total?
Rims looking good 
That color is awesome!

"Congrats! However, based on the obvious window tint, I'd say your headline is a little generous with the word ""immediately"", lol. I hope you got a PPF too!"
"First of its class, the compact mini van."
Should’ve gotten a Chevy instead
Don't think I have ever seen a less interesting car. 
Autopilot on highway 1 is the ultimate test of your faith in autopilot lol
"That’s awesome! I was a little nervous about having to find a super charger yesterday, but it was super easy and convenient honestly. "
Picked mine up and left to Phoenix from LA within a few hours of pickup :)
How long was that drive?! How many stops?
"When they offered the free factory tour, I picked up my s in Fremont and drove back to orange county. "
"My pickup is next Monday, and my work week schedule is packed... it’ll be tough waiting till the weekend to really stretch its legs! Maybe we can manage dinner in Half Moon Bay or something...."
"Can confirm - three weeks later, went on a multi-day trip."
"As much as I love my Tesla and EVs I feel it's just such a hassle to do more than one charge on a road trip. I've driven my MS once from SF to LA for the weekend and without a destination with charging it's it's annoying IMO. 

I'd much rather hop in my Prius with openpilot and drive the 500 miles to in one leg or just a quick 5 min bathroom break. "
"The autopilot is incredible. I was testing its capabilities yesterday. To me, it was a little sketchy in fast moving traffic (I don’t trust CA drivers), and it kinda struggled when new lanes form, but overall it was awesome. Bumper to bumper traffic is going to be a breeze from now on 😎"
"While I love the candy red, it definitely has the”drive like you stole it” and “ticket me” attitude.  I took the Metallic Blue P3D+ too"
"I personally like white, but that's just me"
Agreed :)
"When I saw the red in person it instantly became my favorite.  In photos, not so much."
"Pearl white is superior in every way - it has a pearl coating so it lasts longer, it sparkles in the sun, it makes the car look bigger, and you can see all of the cars beautiful curves."
"Nah nah nah gotta be RED

Respect your opinion tho, they’re all honestly fantastic"
Worst imo but again...just me. 
I really wish I could find some pics of the blue exterior with white interior :\\ 
No love for silver here... but I like being the iconoclast! 
"Red is my favorite in person, although I have midnight silver which is lovely (if a bit sedate)."
Yay! Yet another I got my Model 3 car post with obligatory pic. These never get old 🙄
"Yep, one of my favorite drives ever. Unfortunately it was a little foggy, but still beautiful. "
"The car is awesome! Unfortunately it had a bit of a scratch yesterday when I picked it up in Fremont, so I ended up waiting an extra hour as they were inspecting it, and I have to bring it in later to get fixed. But, shit happens, and they’ll fix it for no extra cost, so no big deal. "
"No, it doesn’t snow in this part of California, and I don’t plan to go skiing enough to put different tires on. 

I believe the 18” tires are an option with the performance brakes, but I’m unsure. "
[deleted]
"18""s will not fit. Source: https://model3ownersclub.com/threads/confirmed-performance-red-brakes-do-not-fit-18-aero-wheels.7608/"
Simply incredible 
AWD
Basically maxed it out :) Performance dual motor AWD with 20” wheels. It drives like a dream!
"We didn’t stay, just did a day trip. I’ve been there a lot but never camped lol"
I believe so! There are two bridges we crossed and I never remember which is which lol
Much better lighting though :)
"Good call! I haven’t been there before either, so I wanna check it out. "
Idk 🤷‍♂️ but I hope you upvotes it :)
"Sorry to hear that. May have mentioned in another comment that immune had a scratch at pick up. I have to bring it in sometime later to get fixed, but it’s not a big deal for now. "
Love it!! Good luck on the convincing 😁
Beautiful!
"I was in Monterey this weekend and it was normal pricing. 

I know they gouge a little at tourist trap but $7 seems outrageous (3.70ish for mid grade). "
Yep! That was the turn-around point of our road trip!
"Nope, it’s one of the prettiest spots in the area for sure"
Nice! Enjoy :)
"Don’t know which way you’re coming from, but I picked up the car in Fremont, then stopped at my house (which is on the way to Big Sur), then put the route in my nav. It said I could make it to Nepenthe and back with 10% battery left (starting from around 80%). So, we stopped for about 20 minutes at the super charger in Monterey, and had over 60 miles by the time we made it back home. Totally effortless 😎"
Probably black at this point.
"No, the acceleration has “chill” and “standard” or something like that, but the standard is damn fast lol"
"Yes they have! Not sure how recently, but it seemed like it was open all the way through (judging by signs)"
"We stopped in Monterey for about 20 minutes, and it was super easy/effortless. "
"Came here to say the same. 

Which tint did you go with op? Looks good."
Don’t think I’ve ever seen a less interesting comment. 
"My issue with it is that it appears to aim for the outside of the curve instead of hitting the apex. And sometimes it slows down, while other times not. And sometimes, just to scare the living shit out of me, it crosses the line while the oncoming traffic is hitting the inside of their turn. I’ve had to kill it hundreds of times for doing exactly that. Someone asked me if it “drives like a drunken teenager” and I insisted it did not. But now I tend to agree. I’d take I5 just to be able to go the whole way without much intervention..."
"Isn't it awesome being able to just hit that little bolt icon and see all the superchargers around you? Especially here in CA, it's honestly the best. "
"You need roadster v2 then :) 

Us normal people have to take more frequent bathroom breaks because the astronaut underwear thing is a no-go for me, and I also usually do want to have breakfast/lunch or dinner along the way, so why not just stop, plug in and walk away to do something you wanted to do anyways and come back to it fully charged. Definitely beats stopping for gas along the way for me. Also wouldnt want to do long road trips wtihout teslas autopilot. Its a god-sent for me. I used to insist on flying anything over 300 miles distance, but now 600 miles can be done with the same amount of effort. "
"500 miles in one sitting? Hell no, I get claustrophobic and my legs start going numb after the first 2.5 hours."
Bumper to Bumper in L.A. with AP almost puts me to sleep it is so relaxing now.
"My thoughts exactly!

(Picking mine up Sunday!)"
"Completely agree!! Upset a color cost me $2,000 when that’s custom paint job effects from majority of the brands 

But that red is beautiful in person but looks not so much in most pictures "
"I loved the red in person so much, that’s what I went with. Everyone was shocked because I’m really not a red person at all, but I love it on the 3. The S is the same red, but I don’t like it for whatever reason. "
"When I saw the photos of the blue I was like ""maybe it's not *that* bad IRL."" Then I saw a blue Model S and a blue Model 3 at work. God it's awful. Taste truly is subjective. 🙃
"
Yeah they should have went with a more electric blue.
"Ah I was worried that you would be in Cali.

I assume it would be too much to ask you to check with the service center? If it's not out of your way, but you would make a lot of confused people happy. "
You spelled brakes wrong. 
I still hear different things. I've heard that nothing under 20 will fit and I've heard that 18s will fit. I think I should just get the car and wait and see if there are performance software updates other than track mode are barred to PUP.
"That's information from a sales guy, from what I've noticed in my many calls with Tesla the sales guys don't know for sure either but they want to sound like they do."
How long did you wait from order to pickup? 
Awesome :) Have fun! 
"These are costing me 10 cents a piece you jackass. I'm roaming!

Getting downvoted because some of yall dont know references from the office 😒"
"I stopped and took a video of that bridge out in the distance

Absolutely beautiful"
"If you don't mind sharing, where is this spot?"
"Would be coming from San Francisco. I was hoping to spend more than a day in Big Sur, but that doesn't seem possible without coming back to Monterey. Won't advocate for Superchargers in Big Sur itself... yet. :) "
Apart from the one you just made. 
"You know you can also nudge it rather than break it out, to keep it in the correct path. I probably would not use it on mountain roads like that, but I use it on curvy freeways just fine all the time. Huge help compared to driving without it, even if it means babysitting in the curves and near exits or creatively merging cars. "
"Yeah I drove it myself for the windy parts of 1, and test it a little on highway 17, but it was a little sketchy"
"Yeah it’s great. What’s more great though is that the vast majority of the time I don’t need the charger because the range is so good! Yesterday I stopped for like 20 minutes in Monterey just in case, but the nav in the car said I could make it from Fremont to Big Sur and back and still have 10% battery!"

"Yep, I used to be able to do that with some regularity (and have done plenty of 600+ mile stretches with my Passat TDI), but I am getting older and my hips and back appreciate more frequent breaks.

For instance: once drove straight through from Orlando to Indianapolis stopping only for fuel (and slept for two days afterwards... the trip also started at 8pm after hanging out at Universal Studios all day)."
"I used to get sleepy from all the focused crash avoidance work all the time, now I can just relax and keep an eye out for the law far behind and in front of me. Much easier to stay focused for a much longer time as it requires much less effort. "
My man! 
I see what you did there
"Haha whoops thanks, fixed it :)"

"Gotta scroll a bit further. One of the forum members (JeffC) actually measured it:

> TLDR: I measured the front Performance Upgrade Option front rotor diameter at 355 mm (which is also a highly standard size, including from Brembo), and the rear at 332 mm. The front caliper to wheel clearance is large enough to probably fit an 18 inch wheel, but perhaps ironically the rear caliper to wheel clearance may not fit an 18. However the barrel inner diameter of different wheels can vary by construction, so some 18s may fit while others may not.

If you go aftermarket, this seems to work: https://tsportline.com/collections/18-tesla-wheels-model-3/products/18-tst-tesla-wheel-set-of-4-model-3?variant=18875944566902"
"I believe I ordered sometime in mid June, so around two months. "
You need a better plan. Badly.
"I don’t know the name of the exact spot, but it’s just south of Bixby Bridge (which you can just see in the background of the photo) off Highway 1 in Big Sur, California. It’s about an hour south of Monterey. "
"You could also do the drive along the coast from San Francisco to Santa Cruz. It’s not quite as breathtaking but it’s still beautiful, and there should definitely be superchargers in Santa Cruz.  "
"Nah, his comment is slightly humorous. Your comment is pointless, sad and obviously craving for attention.

You're welcome for it."
"I use it a full 95%+ on the road, including curvy freeways. I find that as long as I keep it under 80mph it behaves acceptably well. My exit is off 580 which is rather curvy. Man... speaking of curves, I had a major scare a few days ago. I was approaching passing a RAV4 to the left of me during a curve to the right. At about a car’s length distance, I realized it was going to be wayyyy too close for comfort as my car started to cross the line towards the other vehicle. Instinctively I hit the brake to cancel it without my hands on the wheel. BIG mistake, as the steering let go and now the car wanted to go straight... into the guy to the left. I jerked it rather hard, and since I have the Aero wheels which are basically 4 doughnuts, I did this slinky wag back and forth and I know I scared the RAV4 driver seeing how he jerked his car to the left when he saw me doing some really weird stuff. Moral of the story, only cancel using brake with two hands on the wheel. "
">  creatively merging cars

?"
I wouldn't risk that. Plus you don't want to go so low on your battery.

"I have, the issue with calling them is that I will always get a sales rep who knows nothing and says it's an engineering question. They never are able to give me contact info for someone from engineering to ask nor do they get in touch themselves. It's quite frustrating because I would be more than happy to get the upgrade package but I need to have thicker tires for winters."
Ah my bad. Well it's good to finally see this. I will have to wait and see how much software they will withhold from the P3D- to decide if I want to upgrade later. Thanks for the link.
Thank you for all of your wasted time!
"For sure :) you can also just guide it with applying light pressure away from the spot you don't want it to, which also means you have the hands on the wheels if you have to break it off. 
"
"Well there's a very good reason to keep hands on the wheel at all times.

It also suggests that there could be a good rationale for having a mode for Autopilot to remain active even as you override it with the wheel/pedals.  It should yield to your specific overrides but keep active otherwise."
"I’m just a Tesla fanboy, so I have no hands on experience with them other riding in a Model S taxi. 

However, as a motorcycle rider it scares the crap out of me that people are using autopilot on mountain roads. Is it that reliable?  I just don’t have enough faith the technology to adapt quickly in those conditions. Granted, humans  aren’t much better. I guess I assumed most people used it in stop and go traffic and at moderate speeds in your typical commuting fashion. 

What do you do while the car is driving itself? You’ve still got to pay attention and take over if need be, so on a curvy road I feel like I may as well actually drive than stare out the window with my hands in my lap. 

When I’m riding mountain roads, someone crossing the line on a curve is a constant concern. If the Tesla auto pilot tends to go to the outside if the curve, how does it adapt to something coming the other way that’s over the line, such as a large trailer? "
"Sigh... Bay area traffic, apparantly not everybody knows zipper method here"
"Agreed, with the 20 minutes of super charging I had about 60+ miles left on the car by the time I got home. "
"in good lighting it's incredible

otherwise it's a solid ehh"

"I know what you mean.  I spent some time agonizing over it, but when looking more into the 4S tires, I saw that they might be problematic for me.  I do live in the south, so it is usually fairly warm; however, during the winter, I'd say the average temperature is around 30F.  It does get cold here at times... somewhere around 10-30F.  When I looked up the tires on TireRack, it says that...

>Note: Tires exposed to temperatures of 20 degrees F (-7 degrees C) or lower must be permitted to gradually return to temperatures of at least 40 degrees F (5 degrees C) for at least 24 hours before they are flexed in any manner, such as by adjusting inflation pressures, mounting them on wheels or using them to support, roll or drive a vehicle.

While it doesn't hit 20 here often, *it does happen*.  "
I was not aware I could guide it without breaking it. Did you know you can force an automated lane change to be more aggressive by applying throttle during the change?  That has come in extremely handy when the car just doesn’t do it assertively enough. :)
"I pay attention, and I don’t use it in situations that require 100% of my attention. Specifically merging in and out of interchanges, onramps and off ramps, and most surface streets. In the rolling hills of Sonoma I’ve found it works great. If traffic stops or slows down, it is much faster than a human driver to adjust speed to match the leading vehicle very precisely and manage a safe gap for the speed.

I don’t know what would happen if a trailer crossed the line, but I would see it coming and would steer away from it well ahead of time.

What do I do?  Well, I do text. I read Facebook. I can pay closer attention to notifications and maintain closer attention to online dialogue. I can safely key in new waypoint destinations or find a Supercharger while in Autopilot. I can fish through my center console for my toll transponder. I can blow my nose without having to steer with my knees. I can do all of this while anticipating upcoming traffic, and making sure the car is behaving properly. I must assert that I don’t use Autopilot in situations that could potentially throw off or confuse the car. I don’t use it around cyclists or pedestrians, etc. You just have to use common sense. You can predict most events just by glancing ahead and assessing the situation and judge the way things will likely play out. 

But mostly I sit with my right arm on the center console, with my hand on my knee, and my left arm gripping the door handle. I give a nudge to the wheel as required every 60 seconds to keep it active. 

I’m ready to take control at all times, which does happen several times per day. But my god, let me tell you... it is so serene and relaxing just being able to sail from the Bay Area to Sacramento and be completely relaxed and refreshed, instead of feeling harried and tired. It feels like time goes by effortlessly. 

Anyway... I’ve had a lot of people drive the vehicle express doubt that it was as capable as I say. But once they’re done, they completely get it. Every time I have a friend with me, they’re begging to get behind the wheel again. It will completely change your perspective on transportation. You simply won’t be able to bring yourself to buy any new car without this feature. 

Anyway, I love my BMWs, but they’ve just been sitting on my driveway collecting tree sap for months. Driving them now just feels odd and terribly obsolete. "
"I was in Minneapolis a few weeks ago and rented a Model S. ([trevls.com](https://trevls.com)) Tried out the autopilot in various conditions. At one point, it got confused when a right turn lane split off (no markings). It looks like it assumed the lane had just gotten wider and aimed at the spot where the lanes would split. I didn't wait to see if it recovered, I manually steered it back into the proper lane.  Plus, it does not detect stop signs or red lights so you must take over and brake if you are first one in your lane at the intersection, not following another car which is stopping. 

So I could see its value on a freeway or stop-and-go traffic but my impression it's not a meant for unattended driving in anything but purely routine situations... and even then, I would not trust a machine. I work with computers. "
"When I rented an ""S"" they advised us to NOT go below 50 miles range. And only charged to 90% unless going on long trips. "
"There is better hardware and there will be more software in the future so I want the performance package. The track hardware just isn't for me though purely because of Canadian winter.

Maybe there will be some non-OEM tires that are 18""."
"Oh really. Damn, that was one thing I really hated, how it started being so slow in changing lanes at some point. Gotta try that out. I did realize that hitting the accelerator while doing so helps nudge it to get going when hesitating next to a car behind me, but did not know it could overall speed up the process. I'll try that the next time I switch lanes with no other car around to impede me, thats where it was annoying to be slow. "
"Fantastic news. Was beginning to get worried with all the low production weeks they kept reporting, but they came through and delivered!"
It's a damn shame this isn't the top Tesla story today. This is fantastic news
Pretty impressive! 51-53k total Model 3s and 80k vehicles overall
Ugh. If Elon had just **not** Tweeted!
Tesla madness!
Good time to load up on some stock :)
So we might hit somewhere between 52-53k? That would be fantastic and seriously what they need right now

"I have never seen such a massive, ongoing blast of crap since I tangled with the Scientologists online. Where the hell are you thousands of unceasing FUDmongers coming from? Why do you care? How much does it pay? "
So under 4k/week... Remember how it was FUD just 2 months ago to suggest 5k/week wasn't sustainable?
hopefully the team can enjoy the weekend and avoid overtime. 
And I bet the main stream media is being quiet now
What’s the FPY tho
How much could one suspect the average used Model 3 will be worth in a few years? Will it follow the classic depreciation of roughly 30% in 2 years? Or will it predictably follow a different pattern & how is this estimated?
"Deliveries to actual people, on the other hand, seem to be a bit of mess.  One friend got ready to leave today for the delivery center, check in hand, and was told that they can't find his car and they'll get back to him next week.  Another co-worker called, waited on hold for a long time only to be told that they also aren't certain where his car is, and he isn't sure if he's taking delivery tomorrow but assumes he is even if they don't know where his car is.  A third one does appear to have his delivery scheduled but it's also a little unclear what the status is.    Since I am the driver - in my Model 3 - for buyers #2 and #3 - I'm not even sure who I am driving down.    It seems like a bit of mess when they appear to be losing track of cars that have built-in trackers in them."
"Why is the bloomberg tracker showing only 2,100 per week? Can someone please explain?"
All I care about is the order book. I want to see pending orders stay flat or increasing. Delivering 50K cars doesn't matter if the order book went down 50K.
"This morning I get to test drive my neighbors P3D that he ordered after driving my Model 3 at he beginning of the year. He took delivery at Rocklin last sunday and said it was a fantastic 5-star experience, also thanks to the volunteer that helped explain more details without any need to finish quickly, giving tips from an owners perspective.

I was surprised how much smoother it felt on the same roads that my Model 3 feels the street bumps pretty harshly. I know his car was $24k more expensive than mine, but with the bigger low profile tires I actually expected it to not be better by that much on terms of road bumps, I would even have thought it should have been worse? So the suspension must be much better nowadays in general or is it that the P3D comes with upgraded suspension too?

&#x200B;

It was amazing to floor it and look in the mirror and see the legacy gas parks looking like they are parked in a distance, I get some of that already in my RWD but wow, this was even more mind blowing.

&#x200B;

Another worry I had was that I may love my RWD less after driving this car, but its not true. I am still amazed and still have the unfair advantage over all the legacy gas cars on the road. But I definitely feel the limits of the car when doing hard cornering more in my car, in his car I went through the same exercises and did not feel the limit yet.

&#x200B;

Back in March or so I asked a service center if my car had the upgraded suspension that is less harsh and they said yes. Now I am wondering if it is true, or if just so much has been improved since then.   I should find a recent RWD build and test drive that for comparison on the same roads.

&#x200B;

I did not check his air pressure, mine are set to 45 cold, 47-50 hot, which is what my door-jamb sticker says I remember I can sacrifice range for comfort by lowering, maybe I should try that. 

&#x200B;

So in summary: P3D is mind-blowingly better but I still love my RWD as it is."
Market response will be a diluted green.

"Elon steps down, Martin comes back "
"Good job, rich guy novelty car company!"
Remember when this car was supposed to be affordable at around 35k pfffffff 😂 lmao 
Leaking information from the quarterly report early because the stock is down today.  No wonder Elon Musk is being sued by the SEC for market manipulation. 
That’s great. But if Elon is out I won’t be buying a Tesla. The reason is because I think he has the vision and ability to push things past their comfort level. He doesn’t settle for less. There aren’t many people that can do that at the level he does.

"Does anyone have a lot of info on how Tesla is going, financially? Is the company doing good besides Musk's interactions with social media?"
Interesting choice of words as deliveries will be what matters for profitability .  Good to see production is up now just how many got in owners hands? 
"Yeah too bad their delivery team is dropping the ball. I had a text two weeks ago that I was ready, and now no one will even answer or respond."
The goal was *very low*. So what if they made it.
"2000 cars produced in 2012, 50,000+ in a single quarter of 2018. This must be a fraud."
Tesla’s still Tesla. They’re still making cars. End of the day it’s the same company. 
I'll take the Tweet. I just put another 5K towards the stock today. Quarterly numbers should be great.
Keep in mind his past tweets have also elevated the stock... can’t have it both ways. 
the sec won't do shit as long as musk lines their pockets 
Just wait until that shareholder call once the numbers are made official.
Wrote some puts this morning....
"Ya, I guess it depends on how long the story lasts."
"Omg this is so bad, it's good. And everyone knows that's the best kind of good!"
This is perfect! :D
"Probably more concerned with the SEC charges that came out against Elon. Also, these numbers are not final, official numbers from Tesla."
"The article wasn't 100% rainbows and unicorns. Yes they hit a goal, but what is this

> For the first time in months, Tesla was able to produce about 5,000 Model 3 vehicles over seven days

5K was supposed be something done and past a while ago. Musk was claiming they were moving to 6k in August. What was holding them back.

Doing simple math their goal was to average less than 5K cars a week. So technically their goal was to stick with the status quo of what they were doing even though Musk was promising more. The only real remarkable take a away is that they are actually able to set realistic expectations and they were able to hit it. 

The big question is, did they hit 5K by another all hands on deck approach or were they able to do it with relative ease. "
"I don't think even the biggest sceptics expected them to miss it. So it's the old "" already priced in"" game."
And it shouldn’t. Throughput has nothing to do with anything financial whatsoever. 
It will once the numbers get released. 
"This kinda feels like the Clinton impeachment hearings.  Country is doing awesome, gotta find some scandal to make into big deal. 

"
This burst week is already priced into the stock 
I believe that at the beginning this subreddit was providing lots of VINS (in fact there was a bot and people interested in catching every VIN) but now excitement is down because seeing a model 3 delivered is no more news.
"bloomberg tracker tracks the average, not actual weeks. Few weeks ago, they were around 2k/week and bloomberg now reflects this"
"I think you spilled some FUD all over yourself, might want to take a step outside and clean that up. "
"If Tesla stabilizes as an ongoing concern, a *LOT* of people are going to get disrupted, and the company's starting to get big enough that they can't be ignored or simply dismissed as a West Coast rich man's toy company. 

"
"It is aggravating, isn’t it?  I honestly think most of them are sadists.  Why would someone be so full of glee about upsetting Elon Musk “fanboys”? 

I think the FUDmongers are FAR MORE dogmatic in their hatred of Musk than the “fanboys” are dogmatically worshipful.

Seriously, I don’t see many dogmatic “fanboys”, just people that admire what Musk is doing, and get really aggravated about all of the misleading reporting and flat-out misinformation that seems to be ubiquitous.  It’s hard not to be defensive when you’re constantly having to correct the record with these people.

ALL HAIL ELON MUSK THE WISE!  BLESSED BE HIS HOLY NAME!"
"Your mad because short sellers are doing there job? They are supposed to hate on the company, that's how they make money. A thing that I think people forget is that short sellers are investors in the company. "
What? You know 52k is more than 4k a week right? The line also has to stop to be upgraded so they pretty much achieved close to 5k sustained to get 4.3k a week average.
"It's quite possibly sustainable from a production standpoint, but why produce more cars than your logistics can support? "
"First paragraph.
 https://electrek.co/2018/09/26/panasonic-ahead-schedule-tesla-gigafactory-1-battery-cell-production-lines/"
A car company producing cars is not exactly huge news
"Models S and X seem to hardly depreciate at all, at least here in Australia, still paying a 100k for a $125k car that is almost 10 years old, possibly because the wait for new cars was so long.

Once the 35k model 3 hits? It will probably depend on fixabilty and availability of batteries and parts.

The good thing about a super simple interior and screen for gauges is probably the replacement potential and longevity."
Power train miles are something crazy like a million miles.  Batteries degrade but can be replaced and some reports have indicated minimal degradation even after hundreds of thousands of miles and GF will eventually recycle these.  Tesla is built on a shrinking economy model (e.g. reduce car ownership by offering autonomous rides for sale) - part of their model that is completely overlooked is a Tesla will last far longer than other cars and will shrink number of cars sold as it eats up more sales.  This is eBay's model (see e.g. PayPal acquisition).
No new VIN registrations.
There wasn't really any production capacity growth. What is there to get excited about. 
You need to take some finance classes and read the news.
Martin couldn't handle expansion during the roadster program. That was a fraction of the numbers now. 
"Sueing Elon in an unprecedented 2 months when it should take at least 2 years, and right after Q3... maybe the SEC should get investigated."
"I think we are past the point of Elon being mission critical. I'd love for him to stay but I also want him to stop with the self inflicted wounds. If he can't stop and our options are him being out or Elon being destructive, then he needs to go.

 It's a real shame because when he's behaving well, he absolutely crushes it. "
"Why the downvotes though? All you dick riders get upset over any criticism, even valid criticism. "
About $5 Billion in sales this quarter.  Things are going ok
You'll know in a few days... But they shipped their target number.
"Delivery logistics are not easy especially without dealerships but it's strictly easier than production. What I'm interested in is how profitable the company was without deliveries figured out. Renting massive lots, offering incentives to accept delivery, and a host of other factors are expensive. Once those issues are smoothed out, and they're not as hard as production issues, it's free margin going forward. "
Yes I probably should have used a better change of phrase. I too will want to see how many were delivered. 
I'm on my 3rd delay so...
"I got mine in a week. Seems like they pumped them out to the West Coast. 

When I picked up my Model S I chose the delivery location. Now you only get a couple of options. They are really trying to move them as fast as possible."
"Just another blip in their history. People have said the same basic thing at every step in Tesla’s history.

The delivery expense is something important to optimize as it can affect margins. Mid to long term I see it transitioning to fully autonomous deliveries. Just punch in the address and it drives itself away. "
So they can continue to be the best selling sedan in US for the next two years....
The goal was higher than your post points though
"It's the highest in company history, but what can we say to try and make that seem like no big deal?  Oooh, I know!"
"That's not an equivalent comparison. 2k in 2012 was the full output of the entire company. 

2012: 2k Tesla cars produced
2018, 3Q alone: 75-80k Tesla cars produced.

Dooomed!"
Clearly exactly like Theranos!
are you inferring that going from 2k/year to 50k/quarter in 6 years is incredible?
Umm... the fraud accusation has exactly zero to do with production numbers.
Legit couldn’t tell if you were serious. I still meet people who say Tesla is vapourware.
I think your getting ahead of yourself. 
I hope the SEC included this in their lawsuit 
"It's still the same company but I fully believe that Elon has a Steve Jobs-like effect on its success. He is uniquely capable of marketing the idea of the company and its products to the average consumer. That's why many, many people still think that tesla has the only car with some self driving functionality, even though most other new cars now actually come with lane assist, radar-based cruise control, and automatic emergency braking. 

As someone who has followed Apple for more than two decades now, Elon has exactly the same kind of ""reality distortion field"" that Steve Jobs was famous for. He makes things seem more awesome than they are and look like they're going to appear before they can. He knows how to make people *want* things. And with a company constantly on the brink of running out of money, where the real thing keeping it going is his quasi-magic ability to always gather more financing, such an ability is of paramount importance. 

Tesla has good products and good vision. But they're not big enough to be out of the woods yet. They need their charismatic CEO to bridge the gap between now and (at least) when the model 3 is fully available *and* profitable to produce. "
"This is why I'm a long.  The fundamentals of the products, the company's vision, and tardy but eventual execution.  If I had more capital, now would probably be a good time to accumulate."
Yup- buy stock today it will recover.
Apple was not the same company without steve jobs. 
"I was talking to my wife about Elon tonight and how if he leaves Tesla, or gets asked to leave, that it will be the end of super creative and fun cars that push what we expect. I used to example of Steve Jobs passing and how there has only been the Apple Watch as a whole new product whereas Steve Jobs brought so many amazing things that no one could have expected. 

I think both Jobs and Musk are visionaries who push people to get out of their comfort zone. 

And no, I don’t have a Tesla so I’m not just saying this as a fanboy "
"Agreed. Elon has generated enough hype for Tesla that the brand is pretty much self sustaining in terms of mindshare. Tesla's are such striking cars, they market themselves. "
"Agreed. Elon has generated enough hype for Tesla that the brand is pretty much self sustaining in terms of mindshare. Tesla's are such striking cars, they market themselves. "
Yes Elon can give the reigns to someone else
"Show me the tweet(s) that definitively made the company ~$10bn and I’ll reconsider 

Plus, we could *absolutely* “have it both ways” if Elon would follow a “get this tweet sanity checked before publicizing” rule; it’s not like some on-a-whim tweet has **made** Tesla a few billion."
"Yea, this is the one time I’d like the rich guy to beat the law"

"Stock goes down because Elon is crazy, stock also goes down when SEC threatens to boot him from CEO. Markets gotta make up their mind. "
"I guess a 78% increase in Model 3 production Q3 v. Q2 is 'status quo' in today's world.  

We all know that Musk continually over promises.  Tesla struggles to meet his 'reach goals', often with mixed results.  Saying this type of increase in output is 'status quo' is a bit disingenuous.

What? Of course some people were expecting that.

"Yeah like illegally lying to investors, every ceo should just be able to do that "
"No I'm a fanboy and even I can see that Elon 100% fucked up in this case.

We can support Elon and Tesla without ourselves lying about what is right and wrong. The SEC is not in the wrong here."
"Because Fred wants it to be so doesn’t mean much. 

I do think the Model 3 production is more indicative of Tesla future but investors are more easily spooked than reassured. "
"They easiest way of discredit your support for someone is to say that they’re in a cult. 

“Elon cult incoming!”, like seriously dude, I just like rockets and electric cars man... chill."
Buyers of puts are not investors they are speculators.
That’s a pretty loose definition of investing. I would say they are doing the exact opposite of investing because they are selling shares instead of buying them and hoping the venture fails rather than succeeds. I’m sure there is some technical definition which the SEC uses that includes them though.
"that statement reads like a goal post move.

"
"That's a fair point... but not really any better from a big picture point of view. If any point in the production -> demand -> delivery -> service cycle is a bottle neck at 5k/week, Tesla is in deep shit."
The rate of growth certainly is.
It was when they weren't
Yeah but with all the bad rep they've been getting and then finally good news
Thank you very much for this insightful reply 
Why should justice take 2 years? 
"Shipped? I think you mean manufactured/produced. We don’t have numbers on how many were shipped. Could definitely be below target.
"
"They had 11kplus in transit at end of 2Q, I think they will hit the delivery numbers even if the in transit number stays the same"
"Well there's a lot of unknown factors with deliveries. There's payment from customer, documents, transport, prep, potential issues, storage, time management, service center efficiency, etc for each individual delivery. 

It may be easier to deliver a car than it is to build one, but once the production process is down, it's done. 

For deliveries it will be much more challenging to perfect the process. 

The whole easy to learn, hard to master mantra "
Free margin?  They have exhausted almost all preorders for the expensive $50k + model 3s.  What happens when they actually have to start building the cheaper versions???
Hahahaha. They are having trouble selling their inventory *right now*. 
"Delivering half of the total 2016 year production (S and X combined) in a single quarter of a single model.

Yeah that’s a low, easy to meet target. 

/s

These Anti-Tesla shills are really grasping at straws. "
"Well at least there will be balance.

Oh wait that's another guy..."
"No but going from 100k cars in the entire year of 2016 to 80k cars in a single quarter only 2 years later is. 

How about the fact that Tesla is producing more EVs than pretty much every major manufacturer COMBINED."
"Nope, definitely a fraud."
Whooosh.
"Sorry but no. I followed Jobs since the 80s and Musk since he founded SpaceX and the claim that he makes things look more amazing than they are is not grounded in reality.
I had driven about ten cars with some level of send-driving functionality, and none comes even close to what even my old AIP P1 Tesla did. His cars not only beat every other car in their category in performance, safety, functionality, efficiency, interior volume and features, but it does that all in the same car, and for each car they sell (you see other car makers bragging endlessly if they beat other cars in ONE of those things with ONE of their cars, some times misleadingly like when Jeep advertised selling the fastest SUV in the market and added below a tiny caveat excluding Teslas), Elons cars do that all (which, by the way, is the first time it happens in the car industry) every time.
He lands rockets upright and relaunches them, it's not a reality distortion field that makes that sound amazing, it is the fact that ten years ago almost every single person working in that field was saying that would never happen.
The things he is doing don't need hype. They don't have good products, they have bizarrely good products that are a decade ahead of the competition (yes, a decade, the cars other manufacturers are announcing for 2022 aren't even catching up in specs).
Edit: correct autocorrect"
"Steve Jobs was nothing like Elon. Jobs and Apple were extremely secretive about the products they were working on. Elon is the polar opposite. 

Apple also relied far less on capital infusion. "
"stop acting like all elon does is marketing. he's the heart of engineering. i fucking hate it when people act like elon doesnt know shit about engineering like engineers are gods. elon is cto of spacex. if he wasnt already ceo of and cto of spacex, he would be cto of tesla too. without elon, tesla would've crashed years ago. he made it work. it wasnt his marketing that made it work."
But look at Apple now even after Steve Jobs has been gone. They likely already have the roadmap in place for the next couple years. 
It's called false advertising... 
Reality distortion field can also be called fraud if you're an angry investor 
"I’m long also. Getting my model 3 and giving people rides confirms what a superior product it is. All the people leave the car with a look of astonishment and contemplation. They either say they want one, or trying to figure out a way to buy one. 
Then today I let my nephews draw on the screen and use all the hidden features. They ran inside to their parents saying they were just on Mars. This car hits every aspect of polish. I feel so lucky to be able to afford it. These experiences solidify my TSLA investments."
The fundamentals? Which ones if I may ask lol
/r/wallstreetbets guys love bulls ;)
What fundamentals? -$16 eps? 
"No, he can't. Elon Musk is still extremely important to Tesla, and you can see that from the stock price. Just a chance of him being ousted as CEO sends the stock down 12%. But I don't it would be that terrible since he would have huge influence at the company even if he loses the lawsuit."
"I think you mean reins. Or rains, as in the Rains of Castamere.

You don’t want that unless you’re short Tesla. And if you are - you need to re evaluate your life. 
"Agree, he is just the face.  
  
#ImpeachElonMusk"
I just don't like how the SEC won't let you be transparent about your intentions with your company. 
"Buy the rumor, sell the news."
I think he meant buy now and wait for the shareholder meeting to skyrocket the stock
"Your comparison really isn't valid since they expanded their production capacity midway through last quarter. You really need to focus on what their average capacity was after the expansion. That number and what they averaged this quarter are really close. So yes, based on data from last quarter, this would be status quo. They proved they could run the lines exactly like they did at the end of last quarter. 

It's not disingenuous, they way your comparing it is though. They had already realized the production capacity increase last quarter. The only difference here is they had access to the additional capacity for a longer time. They didn't improve on anything. 
"
If that is true then in the coming months we should see some increase in cars per week. Not just an increase at the end of the quarter during their production hell weeks. 
Well clearly you didn't read anything I wrote and instead just glanced over random parts. 
They sustained numbers far below what Musk was promising. So they technically missed all the 6k promises. They even averaged less than 5k a week so they missed a whole lot but hit this VERY realistic expectation. So no on was expecting them to miss this low ball milestone. But they did expect them to miss the 6k a week Musk was promising. 
Even i didn't expect Tesla to not report 50-55k 3s produced in Q3.
The goal they set themselves and reached here is *significantly* below that 5k a week they were supposedly at 3 months ago.
">6 months ago the narrative was that 5k a week wasn't even possible

The narrative was that the initial 5K a week was a burst rate, and that clearly was correct. "
Overcharging is wrong. There's a long public history of SEC actions and this is absolutely anomalous compared to other cases. 
"They still own Tesla stock, they sell it to others and make money by the stock going down. "
"They are still investors. They still buy the stock, even though they sell it to others and buy it back after the stock goes down, they are still buying it. "
"Lol, what? It's a pretty simple concept. You don't make more product than you can sell. "
My point is I wouldn't assume they have hit some kind of ceiling based on this quarter. Once the delivery bottleneck is resolved they are free to gradually expand. 
"Considering they weren't at 5k a week sustain-ably like they said they would be, not really.  "
No growth since last week of Q2. They're actually making *less* than 5k per week.
Deliveries are what matters for the quarter. Mine is scheduled on the very last day of Q3 so I expect Tesla is gonna try really hard to make sure my car gets delivered.
">For deliveries it will be much more challenging to perfect the process.

Hire more people, move more documents to Docusign during the process.  Done.  It's really not that hard, they're just wildly understaffed.   Car Dealerships have solved how to get a car off of a truck and get a customer signed and out the door.  There is a huge wealth of professionals who have spent most of their lives dealing with delivery.  And delivering a Tesla is no different than delivering a Ford. "
Once they have production efficient and deliveries efficient they can use that saved waste and apply it to the margin of lower-priced 3s such that they maintain the margin they have now with expensive 3s just with endless demand and are able to make even better margin on a steady stream of expensive 3s. They'll be able to build out their delivery network that's supported by expensive 3s and other models and maintain it with lower priced models past demands for expensive cars.
"Of course you have to carefully avoid spinning it accurately as ""they're selling so many they're having a hard time *delivering* all the cars they've already sold and continue to sell with no end in sight"" 

The tireless spin work must make you literally dizzy."

"no i mean, what are you comparing it to? For example, how many cars was GM producing 8 years after the company started and then 6 yeas after that?"
Not a wooosh
"Drunk redditing is a thing, but I get your point and agree"
I’m not sure what you’re pushing back on. Seems to be the notion of selling a product versus delivering a great one. Both companies delivered great products and that’s the broader point. 
"Two differences do not make them ""polar opposites"". Of course they're not the same person but they both:

- Create an almost religious company loyalty

- Appeal to ""normal"" people who otherwise don't know much about the space

- Are very controlling of user purchasing experience

- Are very controlling of after purchase experience (compare pentalobe screws / glue to tesla bricking salvage title cars and not selling spare parts to outsiders)

- Sell products by image and prestige rather than specific specs (except for the single spec that they have above the competition -- see apple's thinness vs Tesla's 0-60 times)

- Focus very heavily on design

But their most defining feature overall is their Charisma. During Job's reign, could you have told me off the top of your head who was the CEO of HP, dell, IBM, or Compaq? Could you today tell me without looking it up who is running Ford, GM, or Daimler? Whereas many many people know both of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. Because it wasn't necessarily what their companies were selling that people wanted -- it was what *they* were selling. "
"Apple almost went broke once, and was saved by capital infusion by Microsoft. They may not have needed it after 2005, but they had their rough years before."
"Yeah, he definitely drives the product, the culture, and has a definite hand in the engineering directions and decisions. "
"Of course he doesn't just do marketing. I'm well aware of his technical prowess and just the amount of work he puts into all of his company's creations. But good engineering is only part of what it takes to make a product successful -- and it does not appeal at all to the out of market segment that tesla is so successful with. 

Just look at his model X reveal - he's listing all these features with cool names, he's talking about the five star crash rating. And then he mentions how they managed to put an ultrasonic distance sensor *behind* the metal of the falcon wing doors. It was a feature he was clearly proud of -- and one which is no small engineering feat -- and there was barely an audience reaction. 

Tesla is out winning hearts and minds and getting hundreds of thousands of people to fork over money sight unseen, and it's more because they call an air filter ""bioweapon defense mode"" than because they can accomplish engineering marvels. "
"I would say that Apple is only now hitting their stride again as a company. A bunch of weird design decisions and buggy software has been plaguing them since iOS 7, and for a long time it felt that all they could do under Cook's direction was release a shinier iPhone. Now they have a much more polished iOS/macOS, and things like the AirPods are a touch of old Apple's ""it just works"" style. 

Edit- furthermore the time that Steve left Apple is not the time that Elon would be kicked out of Tesla with this lawsuit. Steve left when Apple was in its prime -- top of the market dominance for the first time in 20 years. Right now tesla is more like Apple in 2000 - releasing new and innovative products but very much still the ""little guy"". In between then and Steve's departure Apple created both the iPad and the iPhone, huge contributors to their success today yet. 

What I'm saying is that Tesla is still making their ""iPhone"" -- it's not ready yet. Which is why it absolutely still needs Elon to sell it, to keep the company's ""magic"" appearance alive until profitability lets it stand on its own. Keep in mind that the 3 is still not even halfway producible at stated price goals, the semi is a ways off, and things like the pickup truck are effectively just a dream of the future for the next few years. "
"When people talk about the ""fundmentals"" like this, I think it's in reference to the following: fundamentally, they're the company that's most-aggressively all-in on BEVs, and the corresponding battery pack production to support it (which brings with it huge potential additional business in grid storage and the like).  The market *will* move to BEVs much sooner than many of the legacy automakers seem to think, and many of them will likely go through some painful times (I'd guess in the early- to mid-2020s) as they work to catch up.  I'm not saying they'll go out of business by any means, but there will be a big place in the market for Tesla, which has the opportunity to establish itself as one of the permanent majors.

That is, assuming they execute."
"Not necessarily financial fundamentals, which is why I said ""of the products, vision, etc"". /U/rabbitwonker said it more eloquently."
Let's postpone the answer to that question to the day after Q3 earnings are released.
Because you’re “mental” if you don’t have fun 
Hi buddy! How are you?
"Yeah, worst case scenario is he has to step down from CEO and just assumes any other position in the engineering department. Best case scenario is he has to pay a hefty fine."
Graveyards are full of indispensable men.
"> No, he can't. Elon Musk is still extremely important to Tesla, and you can see that from the stock price.

When Steve Jobs died, Apple stock dipped.  Then it stabilized.  Now they're a trillion dollar behemoth.

Tesla isn't in the same fiscal position that Apple was in when Steve died, but the point remains the same: A lot of people felt that Steve Jobs was irreplaceable, and that the company only had one way to go from there-- down.  But a company is greater than the sum of its parts, and even the biggest, most important parts can be replaced successfully.  Tesla is no exception."
Whenever somebody says 'take the reigns' I get confused visions of a person trying to giddy-up a king sitting on a throne.
The momentum they have is unstoppable with or without Elon
"Nono, do the /r/wallstreetbets tactic: Buy high sell low."
Exactly 
"I had not considered that they were struggling with the ramp up in Q2, so your point is well taken.  Thanks for pointing out the error in my 'snap analysis'. 

They still seem to be figuring out how to produce efficiently.  If they can get enough experience they should be able to move the production numbers up from here.

Regardless,  going from nothing to a run rate of 200,000 Model 3s per year in 18 months is an achievement.  Now they have to do it with a good margin. 

Let's see if they can achieve the margins that [Munro](https://chargedevs.com/newswire/teardown-specialist-sandy-munro-tesla-model-3-should-deliver-30-profit-margin/) thinks are in the car before they run out of cash."
"They were able to consistently, week-after-week, achieve a production rate of ~5000/week.

Last quarter they achieved that for just one week.

Consistency is an achievement."
"And significantly above what some of the shorts were predicting. According to some Tesla should've been bankwupt by now. We'll see what happened in Q3 and what will happen on Q4 very soon.

At the same time, what Elon did with those tweets was pretty plainly a violation of the law.

"No, puts are a synthetic.  It's a lottery ticket that the stock will go down. If they exercise, for a moment they are stockholders. I'll give it to you on shorts as a highly technical matter."
"No, that would negate the short sale if you had to buy it first. Shorts actually borrow the stock from a real investor and are charged interest on the loan while the short position is open. A margin call is the original owner requesting their property back. 

I’m sure it is technically defined as investing by the financial industry, but it really doesn’t fit the naive definition. It’s more like the investor in Tesla is investing his stock shares into the short’s financial skills."
And some reports of battery bottleneck but Panasonic claims to be ramping up ahead of schedule.
Quarter over quarter is absolutely a growth. They hit one week of 5k last quarter. Their total sales are going to be much higher this quarter. 
"Not even just that man. It's also on the customers end, I work in the car business. 

Customers often want a car, but will wait until the last minute to get shit done. And then you have hiccups like financing awaiting approval for borderline credit, waiting for checks to be cut for 3rd part finance, slow with trade in process etc. 

Not everyone is like the enthusiasts on the forums and Reddit who do everything the second they can.

The docs are literally the easiest and most minor issue to solve. Minus a system wide outage, it barely affects anything.

The logistics, reliable car haulers are EXTREMELY hard to find in scale. And if you are scheduling a customer to take their car a few days after the car shows up max, there's no room for a breakdown, blowout, delay in loading/unloading, traffic forcing a 36 hour reset. Car hauler sends a truck to a pick up with 2 hours left on his log for the day. A 1 day trip just changed to 2-4 depending on his log, 

You're making it way more simple than it actually is. Solutions are really easy to put on paper but very difficult to implement."
I guess in the future the tesla might drive itself from the factory directly to the customer.
"I don't think you comprehend the amount of money Tesla is losing every quarter.  Model S and X sales have flattened.  What happens when this record breaking bull market goes away and new vehicle sales crash like they historically do?  Tesla is in for a world of trouble.  Plus, we've yet to see any quarterly results that reflect the new tariffs recently put in place.  51k vehicles produced in 3 months is only a run rate of about 3900k / week, quite short of their projections!  Despite having production shortfalls, they are still running fire sales to liquidate their parking lots full of vehicles!  What gives?  I wouldn't call that ""endless demand"" like you say..."
"That is a true statement. Awesome how Tesla fails massively at both, right."
Production is a key argument about the success of Tesla. Seeing such massive growth shuts that argument down
!(Not a wooosh)
Yea I’m not seeing the wooossshhh here.  He’s trying to joke that people think everything at Tesla is fraud when it’s not but hat isn’t true.  People are screaming fraud because Elon’s tweet can very easily be seen as fraud.
Not A Woooshthrower?
"The point is that iPhones and Macs some mostly in image. At least in their original phases, awesome products as they were, people were buying then without other reason than coolness and belonging.
Proof but Teslas because they are better cars. Companies fly in SpaceX because they give you the same orbit for one fourth the price. Image has little to do with it."
You’re completely right. That person has no idea what they’re talking about. 
"you're really digging deep to find the similarities. you're wrong on almost all of it and the ones you're right, that shit just goes with the territory. a religious following of the man would always happen if he's a great leader."

That was when Jobs had been gone.
"the fuck are you talking about? people are buying teslas because the naming schemes? come on man. teslas are technologically better than every EV out there right now and even the ones coming. an engineering firm did a breakdown of the model 3 and said it was ""military grade tech ahead of its peers."" they're not forking over money sight unseen neither. it's a deposit that's refundable. tesla has already made fantastic cars before the one coming out. people know there's a huge line so they have to get in early and that's why there's are preorders like that. and guess what? the model 3 didnt disappoint.

musk is the face of tesla but that's not why he's crucial. he's crucial because he's the only one capable of managing and solving all the problems that arise and the one with enough conviction to face the trials ahead. he has shown countless times before for both companies that he wont give up even when the situation is most dire. in fact, he has never ever failed a start up before. he goes bigger every time and never fails. ceos fail at start ups all the time before they succeed, not elon. and before anyone tells me that i'm a retarded fanboy. i'll let you say it when he failed at least once. he hasnt for more than 2 decades and they were all cutting edge technology companies every time. it wasnt something someone else already laid the path. "
It just works if you buy in the company's ecosystem. Else it's utterlly a failure.
I'd argue that Tesla is already established. They'll at worse be an established luxury(ish) car brand attached to an energy company. How much they grow is up in the air.

LMAO touche
I like that quote. Who said that?
"""The stock went up"" does not = ""the comapny is innovating at a higher level than it's competitors""

&#x200B;

Apple's lack of innovation post Jobs has been well documented.  That's the concern here.

&#x200B;

Not to mention Musk drove Tesla through some enormously rough patches in one of the most difficult business areas around.  I do not think many, perhaps any, other CEOs could have gotten Tesla to this point.  He is a world class problem solver and word class CEO/entrepreneur.  That's not really disputable, even if he sucks a bit at corporate communications."
"Apple hasn’t been the same since Steve Jobs died. Sure they continue to make money but it’s through incremental improvements and a loyal fanbase, not because of great innovation and disruptive technologies like it used to be. Name one new exciting Apple product that was launched after Jobs, maybe you can but they all pale in comparison to to the original iPod, iPhone or Macintosh. I don’t want that to happen to Tesla, at least not yet."
And then they dropped the headphone jack...
While I wish that were true - the undeniable truth is having Elon will improve Tesla’s future. The trajectory of Tesla is much brighter with him at the helm than without. 
Works every time 😂 
This kind of civil discussion really makes me happy.
"Yea, it's still impressive but not much seems to have happened this quarter. Maybe it's all behind the scenes and they were trimming the fat to bring down costs. 

It took standing up the tent to get to 5k and that was pushing at 110%. They don't have a whole lot of space to expand at their current location so I'm skeptical they will be able to put up any real meaningful increases anytime soon. "
"You didnt read anything or did bad math. Their goal puts the average at closer to 4k. And the article says they hit 5k for the first time in months so they only did 5k for one week this quarter. 

Great but consistency at this point isnt the wow factor to drive the price up or anything to get super excited about."
"Good point. He's a nice high profile case.

 Although they'll have egg on their face if he walks away clean, and I don't think it has the jury appeal of the Martha Stewart case (what exactly was the damage & how did he personally profit? Any jury would know Saudis are loaded - I think for most jury members all he'll need is secured in a colloquial sense). Or enough  members could be convinced of an honest misunderstanding)

  So, I won't be surprised if a settlement is reached."
"And? It would only be news if they wouldn't have produced 51,000 3s this quarter. Doing what is expected is *not* news."
"Most dealerships don't even \*start\* the financing process until you're on the lot and picked out a car.  The fact that Tesla can theoretically resolve financing before you arrive puts them ahead of the curve.   When my wife bought a car it took like 3 hours but it was straight forward.  When I bought a Volvo it was about an hour and a half. When I picked up my Tesla, they finished up in 10 minutes... before my wife even got to the Delivery Center.   


Today, it's a different story.  Today it apparently is taking hours because of a backlog of people handling paperwork, washing cars, moving the car from the lot to the delivery area etc.   The bottleneck isn't car carriers or backroom logistics it's literally getting someone to a clean car, signed and out the door with the staffing for a delivery every 15 minutes trying to handle a delivery every 5-10 minutes.   


Your truck blowout isn't a problem with a normal dealership like Volvo who tell you ""Looks like your car might be here some time this week."" And then they call you when it's in the dealership and ready to pick up.  If it takes 5 days instead of 2 you just get the call later. Tesla is attempting JIT scheduled delivery and that's the wrong way to do it.  The right way was when my Volvo dealer (who wasn't overworked and could respond to emails in about 30 minutes) would pick up the phone and say ""Hey, im\_thatoneguy, it's here! It got here a day earlier than we even thought, do you want to come pick it up right now?"""
"When you also have people that say, “Let’s move from doing third party to Financing” through the company, seems to make it a tad more difficult to pull off a 15 minute delivery. "
"A lot of customers probably don't want 2,000 miles on their ""new"" car though.  "
"Again, how do you define massive? Relative to what? I am saying that if other auto manufacturers were creating more cars per year after 8 years of business and then had the same, or more, growth, 6 years later then there is nothing to see here. So nothing has been shut down. You can't look at these things in isolation. 

You can have ""massive"" growth but still be failing relative to your peers."
!(Not a wooosh) == False
"Apple products have many innovations built into them too. Apple’s user experience has always been top notch and that’s what they focus on more than specs or image. Apple hardware is high quality. They have released multiple revolutionary products as well as releasing well thought out iterations to existing products. Face ID, waterproof, and Apple Pay are some recent ones. "
"There are many great run companies that you never hear about. The most consistently successful company for the last 50 years (as measured in 2010 or so) was a bolt manufacturer. Nobody outside the industry had heard of them. The CEO himself was surprised. But they were well lead and consistently profitable. 

Elon's not even a great leader by several standards. Just like jobs was he is shitty to his employees and causes burnout. In fact Elon is much worse than Jobs in that regard -- tesla and spaceX are both pretty poor places to work at if you fancy having a life (or a competitive wage). 

But they both have the charisma to make their company stand out and be *heard of*, and have its products be *wanted*. That's what I'm talking about. "
Again. I'm not saying they are the same person. I am saying they have the same effect on their company. 
That is correct. But even before that Apple wasn't a cash cow.
"It's not the name I'm talking about, it's the ethos that he creates with every choice he makes. 

In the consumer's mind:

Teslas have a 5 star safety rating. Teslas are fast. Teslas *look cool*. Teslas are badass and futuristic. 

It's not because he's capable of designing a good car. Thousands of engineers can do that. It's because he's capable of designing a car that people *want*. Part of that want is that it's a good car. But part of that is the image and ideas that he creates in people's heads with the decisions he makes. 

They're not separate things. No other car company was willing to make a consumer level electric car that could go 0-60 in below 4 seconds. No other car company was willing to make an electric car that looked good. It's because Elon was there and made those choices that we have Tesla today. Of course he had to follow through in engineering. But the success of the story is that he knows *which* engineering decisions to make. "
"Which is exactly the long term strategic goal, start high end and work your way down."

"Long time Reddit classified “Apple Fanboy” here.. can confirm, I am secretively less impressed with Apple year after year since Jobs died. 

Problem is we don’t have a quick switch and are stuck on the brand.. but that day will come when another brand takes me and others, many others. 

Apple needs to step up their game and get back to being trend setters and a leader of innovation. I literally feel like nothing new AND impressive has come out since Jobs died. "
"I think it's unfair to expect any company to consistently produce disruptive technologies multiple times a decade. I'd say Apple has already produced the foundations for disruptive tech in the Apple Watch. Disruption here will be in the healthcare industry if they keep adding on additional biometric sensors and find a way to package that info in a way for medical providers to access and utilize. Who knows what's in store for their ECG app, for example. And they have been investing heavily in AR technology, which makes AR glasses look more feasible year after year. Airpods, while not ""disruptive"" like the iPhone, are still an amazing product and one of Apple's best inventions in my opinion. "
"Apple wasn't doing so great with Jobs either, until Jobs was kicked out for a while.

I worry that while Musk is there, Tesla's rate of improvement in *all* areas is limited by Musk's personal rate of improvement in those areas. Finance will not improve until Musk learns to be more responsible. Manufacturing will not improve until Musk learns to be more careful and methodical. "
"> Sure they continue to make money but it’s through incremental improvements and a loyal fanbase, not because of great innovation and disruptive technologies like it used to be.

Apple is still disruptive.  The Apple Watch is the only smartwatch on the market that has consistently sold, and sold well.  In my opinion, it's essentially the only smartwatch worth buying.  I tried at least a half dozen smartwatches with my Galaxy S8+, including all of the most highly rated ones-- the Huawei Watch 2, the Fossil Q Explorist gen 3 AND 4, and the new Galaxy Watch (and it's predecessor, the Gear S3).  The Apple Watch is faster, more feature-rich, easier to use, more well integrated with its ecosystem, and has better 3rd party support than _any_ of the other aforementioned devices.

The iPhone pretty much still dictates which design pattern the industry as a whole will go with.  Look at all of these new Android handsets coming out with notches-- one of the new iPhone's silliest ""features"".  It's pretty obvious that Apple is still one of the biggest, if not THE biggest, leader in the industry.  For better or worse.

Finally, I know legends get better with time, but Jobs had plenty of flubs.  There's also NO guarantee that Apple would be doing anything vastly different than it is right now if he'd lived.

Tesla doesn't need to improve its innovation right now.  It needs _money_ so it can continue doing what it's doing.

"
"I don't understand why people believe Steve Jobs was some savior for legacy tech.  He wasn't.  He hated it.  He was the reason they got rid of the floppy drive, and then the optical drive, and I have no doubt that he would've agreed to get rid of the 3.5mm jack.  That's not even getting into his stance on legacy _software_."
Real business persons value consistent results!
"NUMMI produced about twice as many cars in this plant before Tesla bought it.  It stands to reason that Tesla should be able to match that number **IF** they can get rid of the inefficiencies they are currently plagued with.  Addressing these problems to increase throughput with a tent is clever, but not very cost effective.  

I'd like to assume they can tame the automation nightmare and get the 'alien dreadnaught' operating efficiently enough to at least match what NUMMI did without the automation Muskrat is trying to implement.

Tesla surely has a first mover advantage in producing battery packs with GF1.  Panasonic has gone from saying they are looking for other customers to fill the capacity they built to saying they are expanding production to meet Tesla's needs. Coupling this with improvements in production at Fremont could be the recipe Tesla needs to put a couple green quarters up on the board.

Of course, Tesla then has to figure out how to get the produced cars into customer hands.  And they have to figure out how to get Musk's foot out of his freakin' mouth.  It is a very interesting story to follow."
There was a settlement agreed to elon chose not to sign last minute.
"they will settle like they do with celebs (Man Boobs Phil Mickelson and 50cent), but they want to kick him to say that his disruptive tech is not cool with the old guys and he is NOT part of the club."
"It is, you're just forgetting the context.  In slightly more than a year, they went from 0 to a 250,000/year production rate out of a single factory.  

Tesla's posting numbers that everybody said were impossible to get that quickly, and now they're playing the ""meets expectations"" card.  It's weird to watch."
"Volvo has a majority of their cars purchased and shipped to the dealership by the dealership before the customer even thinks about going car shopping. The dealership is its own company and has its own staff for JUST that dealership. The dealership doesn't care if they deliver the car 5 minutes after it arrives or 15 days.

I know you're saying the bottleneck isn't logistics, but that's very incorrect. There are many other reservation holders getting delayed because of logistics. It's not the SOLE bottleneck, but it is one.

You also have to understand, there are >10 Volvo dealers in a 30 mile radius to me and only 1 service center. And that service center has a radius much larger than 30 miles for delivery customers as well. 

Tesla can't afford to wait to schedule cars until they're on the ground because that will severely limit the amount of deliveries they can do.

They have limited lot space, I drove to my local SC and they had cars on the grass and quadruple parked. Rep on site said they had to turn away trucks because they were full. This would be even worse if they waited to schedule until on the ground. 

Look, I know it seems like an easy problem to handle. But it's not, I've been in the industry for the past 5 years in different facets for multiple manufactures and they all struggle with this. But on the dealer franchise inventory model the problems stay low scale.

It's the exact reason it's impossible to truly order a toyota. Their ""orders"" are actually just allocations. If you want a blue Camry with X and X option, you'll wait until one is available from Factory build schedule. It could be 2 days before your car is built or 2 months.

It's really one of those things where you have to be in the industry and see all the moving pieces to realize how even 1% of the total pie messing up causes disasters and delays."
You could also get financing before going to the dealer. Super quick through pen fed. They mailed me a check I went to the dealer and handed them the check. From there paperwork was super quick and I was out the door. 
"It doesn't matter what other companies growths were like, Tesla is only fighting against Tesla here. Their cars are playing a different market than the other boys (soon they'll clash hard but for right now), Tesla's growth at any decent pace shows that this business model can work and succeed in this market, and anecdotal but here in NJ I'm starting to see quite a bit of 3's"

"Never denied that, but for years the reasons Peele bought Apple products were not related to any actual technical advantage. E.g. the primary reason offered for buying a Mac in the 2000s was security, then Macs had more unpatched vulnerabilities than any other platform at the time. Most other reasons were also not grounded in reality. And while Apple products have always had great characteristics, for years users would not even know how she competition compared. Apple is often offered a well known marketing study on how to create a sense of community and image, driving sales through those factors, including ""reflection"", i.e. what buying this product days about myself. They may have very well been the best products ever, but that would have made much less of an impact on their sales that the image they projected, of which Jobs, and his carefully orchestrated presentations, were a big part."

I guess I mostly agree with that. I do think Musk is still more important to Tesla since there is so much speculation around it.
"But that won't happen until *maybe* 2025, quite probably no earlier than 2030. So it's completely irrelevant to Tesla."

"> Apple needs to step up their game and get back to being trend setters and a leader of innovation

Are you kidding me?  Take a look at all of these phones adding notches, removing headphone jacks, etc, and tell me that they still would've done it if Apple hadn't.

As for recent innovation, no one has a smartwatch that performs or sells anywhere near as well as the Apple Watch.  I mean it's not even close.  The closest might be the new Galaxy Watch, and even then Tizen OS its running is a crapheap that doesn't integrate with Android worth a damn.

For better or worse, Apple IS still a trend setter, and they DO still innovate.  I say this as someone who uses primarily Samsung mobiles because they're the only ones NOT blindly following every design cue that Apple comes up with."

"> You also have to understand, there are >10 Volvo dealers in a 30 mile radius to me and only 1 service center. And that service center has a radius much larger than 30 miles for delivery customers as well.

I feel like you're just reinforcing my case which is that:
Tesla's problems are from understaffing. 

A larger parking lot and more employees solves nearly all of those problems.  More employees means you can park cars further away.    Everything loops back to ""Tesla is understaffed"".   This is definitely a problem where more money solves the problem.  Also better QC. 

My Volvo was custom ordered, assembled (with updates), put on a ship (more updates), crossed an ocean (with updates all along the way), put on a car carrier (more updates) and shipped to my dealer which had no lot and no inventory. 

The difference between the two was A) there was no fear my car would reach me and turn out to be undeliverable because their manufacturing was spot on B) the dealership only turned over a handful of cars a day. 

Trying to deliver 80 cars a day is ultimately the problem.  It's compounded by the vehicles that should sail from VIN assignment to delivery without an issue getting hung up along the process.  My delivery process was a couple months and it progressed at a slow and steady pace.  ""Your VIN has been assigned and has started manufacturing.""  ""Your car has left the factory.""  ""Your car is on the boat..."" etc...   It's further compounded by delivery specialists being overworked and under trained to help line up financing etc.   
"
"Even so, their cars are direct competitors for ICE cars though. Or I should say, substitute products until EV becomes the norm. I definitely agree Tesla has shown the business model can work and I am pumped about that. As a car enthusiast, I think the Model 3 Performance version is a game changer. Imagine what that car can be in 3-5 years with more R&D and technological improvements. Its the first time I am considering a Tesla. I am torn between buying one 3 months from now or waiting for the ""Gen 2"" version of the performance model. Not sure when that would be though. Tough decision. "
"There was definitely a marketing and community factor, but people often misattribute Apple’s success to that. They usually tend not to be the people who get it, so it seems all style and flash to them. 

It’s the other way around, actually. Apple has a different philosophy than other computers manufacturers, one that cares about the user experience, and that is what engenders loyalty. 

If there is any product person out there that thinks Apple is only about marketing and trendiness, then they simply don’t get products. "
"Did you actually read my first post? I was literally saying that Elon is critical to Tesla's success. 

Could you maybe calm the fuck down and consider that maybe the people around you aren't complete idiots? I'm well aware of the engineering *and managerial* effectiveness of both Jobs and Elon. I didn't put it in my post because I assumed (wrongly, apparently) that it didn't need to be said. "
"I would agree. Especially in this particular period -- Steve left Apple when they were at the top of the market. Tesla still has a long way to go, especially in terms of getting the model 3 standard range out there and not doing it at a loss. 

In this vulnerable Time, they definitely need every boost they can get. And Elon is a big part of that IMO. "

Funny that the Samsung Fanboy is praising Apple and the Apple Fanboy is holding his breath for real innovation to come back to Apple. Oh how times have changed!

&#x200B;

I've been really into Apple for probably 12 years now.. not super long, but caught the bug bad. I have owned almost every product they line came out with in that time frame, including many of each. My whole house is automated and uses iPads, iPhones, AppleTV's, Airport Extreme with Airport Express extenders and audio input for whole home audio, iMac and Macbook. The last iPhone I bought was a 6S Plus and the one before that was a 6S, and my next one will be a 6S Plus. The only new product I haven't bought was an iWatch, I bought a Fitbit Charge instead, which has been indestructible... and I work as a tradesperson.

&#x200B;

Point being.. I'm about as Fanboy as it comes.. it's all Apple, but I am getting over the bug. Not that I want to, I'm just not impressed any more. And I don't think I'm alone. I'm drifting in limbo waiting to decide, will Apple come back or will I be slowly switching my hardware out for something else.. maybe Samsung, hey? "
"Not sure about decade**s**... but yeah, probably a decade could be a big a downturn if they don't straighten the ship out.

Apple stock went public in 1980 and basically went from $0.50/share to $1.50 by the year 2003 (23 years). Around then is when people realized their iPod was going to be something big and the stock continued upward with every new release of technology, hardware and software.

So from a $1.50/share in 2003 (not long ago), to $230/share in only 15 years. If you had asked almost anyone 2 decades ago if Apple stock would become so valuable, they'd probably have said ""Apple Who??"" It's hard to say how a business will do in the near future, let alone the distant future.

&#x200B;

Blockbuster Video, Radioshack, Enron, Pan Am, MCI Worldcom, Woolworths, Standard Oil, TWA, Bear Stearns, Kodak, General Motors, Lehman Brothers. All of those were huge, powerful, profitable and market dominant companies, who in their heyday seemed untouchable. Things can change really fast, with success and with failure.

&#x200B;

To be clear.. I do wish Apple success and I want them to come back. I'm just a consumer of their goods, not a short seller or investor of their stock."

"I was working from memory (not always a good idea).  I found this link showing that NUMMI [topped at 450,000 per year](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-factory-built-more-cars-when-it-belonged-gm-and-toyota-2017-10?international=true&r=US&IR=T).  It looks like there is conflicting information out there. Simple math works out to 8,650 per week. This may have been a 'peak' number, I have not done a deep dive into this info.

So I guess there is some headroom above the numbers Tesla is turning in now and something less than the guesstimate 500,000 per year figure I recalled.  

It seems there is room for increased output, but not as much as I thought.

"Yes but the volume of cars that Volvo custom orders and delivers vs Tesla is vastly different. Most of Tesla is custom, most of Volvo is on the ground inventory. When Tesla was selling a boutique amount of custom ordered Tesla's the process was much more seamless and smooth.

But that's besides the point. 

Yes you can solve just about any problem in the world by throwing more resources at it. That's just like saying, hey they can build more model 3's by making 10 new factories all around the country. They CAN but they don't have the capital.

The challenge of any company is handling the business they have with the resources they have available. In this case where it's a vital cash crunch period they can't spend 500k+ on a lot (land in this area is very expensive) and to be honest the land doesn't ex

I'm not saying that in 2 years they won't have the issue resolved with more resources. But with current resources it's very tough because delivery has so many moving pieces and each one is very capital intensive to increase capacity. 

Tesla is trying to increase efficiency BEFORE increasing capacity, which imo is the smart business move. Yes it will be difficult for a period of time, but then when they have the resources to expand, theyll be expanding with better processes and increased capacity. Presumably they'll have a higher cash flow with the increased efficiency so the company will be able to expand in other key areas in addition to delivery volume. Remember ""service hell"" is likely next."
Your underestimating how big the delivery hubs they already have are 
"Ale always cared about the products and quality, that much is clear. But the customer you are describing is the current customer, not the ones one or two decades ago.
On the other hand, I know for a fact that most other computer manufacturers also care about the user experience (I worked for a few), and they do so deeply and sincerely They are just not as good at getting it right, in most cases due to historical factors."
"Out of my ass.
 
>And even if that's true, how is that ""irrelevant to Tesla""?

Tesla won't be around then. But even if, it will most definitely not be relevant to Tesla because earlier you claimed

apple has 285b in cash. that's more cash than most of those companies are worth. that's why i said it's going to take decades for apple to go into decline.
"that's cool that you're not cool with the rate at which he chose to expand tesla. even if you had 10 phds in finance and economics your opinion wouldnt matter. he sees something you dont. perhaps he knows if he waits 5 years and does it slowly, other manufacturers would catch up. in his biography by ashley vance, he explained why he had to push the schedule for spacex so harshly. he calculated far in advance how much funding they had. he said himself that if his employees knew how close they were to failing, they'd probably just give up. it's his burden to maintain the rate of expansion because he plans far into the future. he also said the model 3 production was the last time tesla would bet the house.

it's funny that so many people who have never accomplished anything big in their lives are watching and commenting on his tesla is run. not you, you're actually nobody but the professionals out there. they sit around and say tesla is doing this wrong that wrong and they'll fail. well what proof or experience do these critics have? i dont know shit neither but i can see elon's track record with his companies. the guy has never failed. that's all that matters.

makes me wonder though. why in the fuck are so many people who supposedly don't own tesla stock or a tesla car is in this sub talking shit about tesla and elon. it's like if i don't watch a tv show but i'm in the sub all the time talking shit about it. wouldnt that be so weird?"
"That is an interesting article. Also interesting that it specificially points out that Tesla is doing the opposite of what Toyota did to acheive those numbers. And that the japanese manufacturer style is one of the best. Essentially Tesla to acheive the same numbers has to out do what people currently think is the best manufacturing process. 

It would be interesting to have more detail in what was going on in that plant when nummi ran it. How much of the car was actually built there. "
"I don't think it's a large cost\\efficiency driver.   If you're paying a delivery team $20\\hr and they can deliver 1 car every four hours of labor that's $80 \\ car.   That's only $4m\\quarter.  There is no way they're currently constrained by costs.  It's simply a case of not having enough people in place in time for the onslaught of customers.  4 Hours should be plenty for the delivery team.  Even if they took 8 hours that won't move the needle from $4m -> $8m a quarter and it would enormously help.  


Hence why there are volunteers sitting in delivery centers doing those jobs. "

This excludes any maintenance savings, and also assumes a base passat will be equal to a base model 3 in terms of features/tech. Also ignore the fact the Passat is much for 0-60

>**As individuals we think that having lots of cash makes us rich. For companies it's the opposite. Cash is a liability.** If you come across a company that is cash rich and has nothing else, its enterprise value will be zero. Companies are valued on their future cash flows, meaning their ability to generate cash, not how much they managed to keep. In other words, cash is a measure of past success and investors are interested only in future value. That future value comes from the intelligent allocation of resources toward a valuable goal. A company rich in cash but poor in vision is likely to be taken private or broken up and shut down. Cash is an IOU to shareholders with a thank-you note for the support through the years.

Because that is true. There's no comfort or tech of any kind in the 35k 3. But you are welcome to purchase TACC for only $495 in the passat. EAP will cost you $5,000 in the 3. If they even sell that without PUP.

Ok so lets say they are equal in tech/features.

Are they equal in terms of performance? 8.1 0-60 for passat vs 5.6 0-60 for the model 3? 

The Passat V6 GT comes in at 5.9 0-60 and starts at 30k according to your link...

Most people seem to compare it to a BMW 3 series which starts at $45k (similar in price to the Model 3s that are actually shipping now).

"I am going to be a little jealous of the truckers that get to drive this thing, though."
Lucky if 50 years. 
Freight trains still have an engineer.  Let that sink in for a minute.
There’s still going to be a need for truckers for a long time.
"Personally, I find this hard to believe. Everyone talks about it like we are almost to the point of fully autonomous driving. I drove my uncles Tesla the other day in a rural area with autonomous driving on. I don’t think I’ve ever been as scared in my life. I realized we are still far from self driving capabilities. Much further than we are led to believe. "
"They're will always be a need, especially for the last mile. I work in the industry. When you show me a semi that can navigate Brooklyn, NY deliveries in rush hour, in shitty weather then I'll believe it. Until then, humans will be much better at navigating those final miles to the actual delivery / pickup. 

What I do see in the near future, are ""hubs"" being created where a human driver will pickup or drop off a load there and an autonomous truck will drive 90% of the route and bring it to a nearby hub of where it is being delivered or picked up, and some human driver will pick it up from that hub to deliver it the rest of the way. This scenario is much more likely to play out in the next 10 years, id say we're about 30+ years from completely removing humans from the equation. This is just my observation since I work in the industry and know it quite well"
"There is really no way of telling how far we are from it. I mean we still don't have a spell check that works that well. Driving is a whole other ballgame.

I mean the autonomous driving is pretty amazing as it is, however that last 1% I don't think is bridgeable without another major breakthrough in AI.

That's my informed opinion at least."
"Someone needs to be there to put on chains, handle delivery paperwork, and generally supervise the vehicle.  

That said, when the role is reduced from driving to babysitting the machine, I expect salaries to drop too."
"I don't think we're that close to that. A car malfunction in Auto pilot is one thing but a 60,000lb truck can do a lot more damage. I think we're working our way there but within 10yrs? I don't think automated trucks will make any significant dent in that field."
All human jobs will be obsolete at some point in the 2030s when human-level AGI is developed. 
One more reason to stars driving Tesla semi sooner. 😭
"So what you're saying is he has the opportunity to make a career out of it before it goes away. Got it, thanks."
"Will probably depend on what's in the trailer and where in  the supply line it is.

I imagine automated trucks will be much easier to rob."
"I imagine that there will be a decent overlap period where 100% proficient self driving trucks would still be manned by a human. They wouldn't be driving 99% of the time, but i think the industry will still see the need for a human interface."
I have milk delivered. Sorry you don't.
Thats why I manually masturbate caged animals for artificial insemination 
You think people are going to let those on the road without a person? Nope. 
Specialty driving will still be a thing: i.e. hazmat. Automating that will be a LONG way down the road.
"I highly doubt it. Autonomous driving technology is in a sad state right now despite all the development. I want it to happen but there are considerably problems which are not advancing very quickly, particularly any aspect of interacting with human drivers and not making situations *more* dangerous by acting unusual.

The direction truck driving will go is the same as aviation: semi-automated systems to ease workload, while still requiring operators to monitor systems and take control in certain situations.

Trucking will probably be improved with “autopilot” technologies, convoying, driver aids, etc, but absolutely will not get rid of human operators onboard within the next 20 years, just as aviation will not, despite fully-autonomous airplane operation already being possible.

I think that's pretty much true.  You might get a very low paying job just to babysit the automated driver and that's about it.  Might be a good gig for a college kid who needs to study in silence.
that's not strictly true but it will be reduced.  Point to point will go away more or less but hubbing and shuttling will be a big deal still.
"The most numerous job in most states is delivery(driving crap around).  I agree that that job is going away.  Think about the implications to society.
 "
People still have to load and unload the trailer. 
There will likely be human drivers at the endpoints for quote some time. Navigating the delivery points can be incredibly complicated and replacing blown out tires is still going to be a thing.
I think by 2035 you will not see truck drivers (or really any human drivers) in control of their automobiles. And that's being conservative. It can definitely happen sooner.
"but maybe it'd be like our modern subways, where there's always a conductor even though the trains pretty much drive themselves."
We'll see truck convoys w/ 1 manned truck leading or following a convoy of trucks.

"Yup, when trains are fully automated and require no human inside, then I'll start to think maybe in 20 years the trucks will be self driving with a human inside. And of course for the last mile always going to need people. "

My sales guy was texting and calling me to no end when I was interested in a performance model 3. For 2 weeks always in reach within seconds. 

Once I ordered and he got his $300 commission, I get no reply at all to anything. Except a random “not sure, I’ll check” to like 5 questions and no reply back. "

"Depends on a couple things, so weight is the biggest issue and you will need at least 900 km of range with the ability to charge the thing in 6-8 hours.

Edit: that would be for long haul obviously and for short haul with a company like Walmart the weight would not be so important, but for owner operators it is still going to be a difficult sell."

Yeah 15 years later it's a robot delivering the milk. 
"As a milkman who drives a truck I can say we never went anywhere, while home delivery isn't what it used to be most stores, schools and institutions all have dedicated milk trucks."

I agree. I totally agree. 
Again? [What the hell does it want now?](https://i.imgur.com/MDhbuT6.jpg)
Train engineers do more than just drive the train.
"that's two crew for \~200 semi trucks worth of cargo. I suspect remote operators and ""port pilots"" will mean roughly the same crew per ton."
Sure but the value of a train engineer is much less than a truck driver compared to the value and amount of cargo being transported. The equivalent would be a trucker managing a group of a dozen 18 wheelers at the same time. 
"While I agree with you, the *number* of needed truckers will sharply decline within the next fifteen to twenty years. Presently, trucking is still an industry which a kid can enter as a driver and *probably* retire.  But that won’t be the case for much longer. "
"Level 5 autonomous driving (rural roads in snowstorms) is not super close. And currently deployed Tesla software is not the best example of how close we are. 

Several companies are already selling cars that explicitly allow hands-free autonomous driving (Cadillac and Audi for example). The situations are limited - in Cadillac's case, it's limited to specific highways that have been LIDAR mapped. 

Replacing *all* truck drivers (particularly last mile) is probably more than a decade away. But replacing truck drivers on long highway routes? Not far at all."
"That’s because Tesla’s don’t have fully autonomous driving... not even close, and they’re not advertised as such. They have autopilot only, which is a driver assistance feature for use exclusively on highways and the driver should remain alert and attentive at all times."
[deleted]
"Keep in mind that what you were using wasn't the full software they're working on behind the scenes. 

We won't get that for awhile yet, but what you saw isn't even using all the cameras yet, nor does it have their chip that can do 10x the frames per second as the current chip.

And Tesla isn't the only one working on this, there's Waymo who's already working in very specific areas already. "
"I've used Autopilot since its inception. First, as others have noted, it's not autonomous yet. More importantly, you used it on rural roads. Autopilot works best on highways. It's not ready to hand off human oversight, but it's very, very good. It handles the majority of driving (95%+) on highways perfectly well and it's only using one of its eight cameras. 

It also has a major hardware upgrade already announced for early next year. The AP 3.0 sensor suite has 10x the processing power of the current system.

Long-haul trucking also involves a significantly reduced number of routes with less complexity (no pedestrians, no traffic lights, no sharp turns, typically better lane markings). Popular routes can be scanned and adjusted more thoroughly. Conversely, full consumer autonomy requires basically every road in the country.  You can see from [these maps of major trucking routes](https://www.softwareadvice.com/scm/industryview/trucking-routes-report-2014/) that they can concentrate on a very limited number of highways to start.   


The majority of trucking is on highways, not rural roads, so the devastation of trucking jobs will be sooner than expected. The ""last mile"" in cities and rural roads will take years  (5 or more?) longer. "
The comment you replied put a forecast of 5-10 years for autonomous driving. You don't think 10 years is enough time?
I think that over the next ten year truck driving might go the way of drones. A remote operator will monitor a small fleet but the AI will do all the heavy driving. Remote operators will take over whenever there is a problem the AI can't resolve.
"> I imagine automated trucks will be much easier to rob.

"No source, but common sense, you still need someone to inspect the truck every 24 hours, perform basic maintenance, manutention, refueling/recharging. In Canada and northern US there's also the issue of snow, which cripples autonomous vehicles for now.

"I noticed that about model 3s too. I requested a test drive for an X and it was pretty easy going. We told them it was more of a dream car and a future prospect and they didn't bat an eye.

"Same experience. Deposit placed and now no response at all.

Commision shouldn't be given until a car is delivered and should be part of the paperwork the customer signs. 
"At least in stores, as far as I know, the reps don't make commission. It makes walking into a store much better. You don't feel like you're being hounded and forced into a sale like a dealership."

"Those are true statements.  In terms of autonomy though, value probably isn't a large part of the equation in purely technical/tactical terms.  It should theoretically be simpler to automate a fixed track limited destination higher cargo density per vehicle closed system. It has been talked about for decades.  Perception of safety and unions (rightly or wrongly) have slowed adoption.  The same will happen in the trucking industry."
"The initial statement, was something along the lines of truck driving being a “dying profession.” This is what I argued as what I believe to be incorrect. The growth of shipping is increasing as fast as the decreasing need for truck drivers it seems. Getting a few routes covered autonomously isn’t going to “kill the profession” any time soon. Again. I hope you’re right. I really do, because I’d rather be wrong in this, as I see a lot of benefit to shipping autonomy but I just don’t believe we’re there yet. "

"It’s already happening in Tempe AZ too, but y’all heard about that lady that got hit and killed I’m sure.

I really hope I’m wrong here because I’d 100% rather be wrong. I just don’t see it happening. At least with our current road system. "

"I don’t think 10 years is enough no. I think 20 at the earliest. I hope I’m wrong, I really do but I think it’ll be much longer than we think. Autonomous driving just isn’t that great yet. "

Exactly! 
There have been a few automated freight trains; Muskingum Electric in Ohio for instance and there’s an automated iron ore railway in Australia. Driverless trains are much more common with light rail however.

"Anyways, how is your truck life?"
"Just to throw in my experience, the sales staff who facilitated my test drive did not push me towards a decision whatsoever. It was the 3rd day they had the 3 there (P3D) and the guy was just giddy to talk about the car with me. Afterwards he gave me his card and told me to contact him with any questions. "
"Yea I agree. 

I was able to get a reply once when I added this in the last line of the message. 

“Please reply or I can just contact tesla service myself and tell them I wanted to purchase the performance 3 well before I talked to _____ about it. So he didn’t convince me, I already got that, he made me make a new account and not use my families reservation even”

He really did make me do that last bit, so stupid why. He told me it would take months to change the address. It takes a couple days from what I checked after my order. "
It isn't at Tesla. Exactly what you said is the way it works.
"Far as I know, both CES and OA make commission on Model S and Model X sales. Maybe Performance Model 3 as well. But the commission is extremely small compared to other dealerships. Like, selling an S P100D barely pays for lunch kind of small."
That is a sneaky tactic. Let’s see if it pays off for him. I get paid commission but I try to not let the hounding come out. It’s my job to give you the information you desire and then you the consumer can therefore make your own informed decision.

"Dishwashers have been around for a while, though."
"I think he's referring to home delivery services. Amazon, grocery stores, etc. That deliver food direct to your door."
"There's still a milk man, he just delivers trucks of it to your grocery store.

Just like there's still a a beer delivery truck and a soda delivery guy and etc."
Timing is the issue and also there are employment considerations. For example if you are into a 40ish year career as a professional driver you are probably OK. Sure maybe long haul goes away and they switch you to final destination routes or something - but jobs would still be there for good workers for quite a while. For someone just starting or not so great employees however things start to get tight as the percentage of highway mile driver routes fall. Companies will want to keep experienced good employees and the new and marginal will be let go. This just continues to increase as city and eventually even rural local deliveries go automated. At that point even good workers will face downward wage pressure as they start competing for jobs. Sure growth will happen but a lot of that growth will be driven by the cost cutting provided by eliminating drivers. Shipping is a pretty cutthroat dollars per pound commodity business and the winners will be those who embrace automation as soon as it is ready for a given market.
"Getting a few routes automated does effectively kill the profession. 

Every percent of routes that get automated, is another percent of truck drivers that are competing with each other over fewer routes. You only need to cut about 5% before every one is competing for minimum wage.

Sure, many routes won't be automated for a long time. There are still a handful of milkmen too. "
"one guy could overlook multiple trucks in a convoy, he could also plug them up for charging if it won't be automatized by the time we get autonomous trucks. "
"Automatic monitoring in our global connected world would make wholesale truck jacking dangerous. What if a truck or convoy suddenly went offline? This could be a serious accident occurring or waiting to happen so authorities would be called to the location immediately. Also each truck is basically a rolling security camera array for its self driving features, you would have to jam that and disable any black box recordings. Possible? Sure, easy no."
Cheaper to contract out to regional service teams for roadside corrections than pay a human to ride.
"Well... when you say around a rural area, was that exclusively on highways?"
That's because Uber was way behind EVERYONE in the move to autonomous. 
"Good point on the ""long-haul"" part initially. I can picture a regional highway network with distribution hubs, then using a local distribution network for the local/surface streets. The key takeaway is they can whitelist the most popular highway routes for the vehicle's range. This makes solving the problem significantly easier."
"Honestly even the convoy system will drastically reduce the need for drivers (which are in very short supply right now).  

One human driver with 1-5 other semis following it in convoy mode. Those rear vehicles just need to be able to track and follow yours without issue (according to them such a system is 'ready to go' at any time, take with a grain of salt ofc).  

Full self driving where no driver is involved is definitely further off but I think the convoy system is what so many companies are banking on. If they can have one driver who leads the herd and handles charging then they have cut their driver expense in half or less for that route."
And it'll probably depend on on what's in the trailer as I imagine automated trucks will be easier robbery targets.
"Mate 10 years ago the first iPhone had only just launched.

"20 is so laughably wrong it's insane. Google's Waymo is doing testing RIGHT NOW with cars that do stop for traffic lights, merge, etc. This year they plan to start offering paid trips on taxis where a person at the wheel is supposed to do nothing at all.  

There's no way in hell that in way less than 10 years we don't have hundreds of thousands of self driving vehicles on the roads."
"What level of autonomous are we talking here? Do you think there will be geo-fenced services within towns and cities in the 10-year time frame? I'm not a 100% convinced we need Level 5, sicne for all practical purposes, it makes sense to define a geo-fenced region if you're doing a taxi service, but my thoughts on SDC's keep morphing every month, LOL."
Yeah... no. 
"How do you expect anyone to produce a proof if the technology isn't on the road yet? There's no proof to produce until the speculated situation has happened.

And I didn't pull any statistics. I only mentioned that a driver's job is way more than just driving and backing up at docks, so even automated trucks wont kill the job  market. 

The point someone made about planes still requiring a pilot is a good one too.

The world getting rid of truckers is a big ""may be""."
"Depends what you’re doing.

Some jobs require a lot of thought and knowledge.  

Other driving jobs require being able to breath.  These can probably be automated.


Other speciality driving jobs take a lot. 
I do heavy haul. You have to calculate line strength, pulling angles, tie down weight formulas, do a lot of math to know how to position a load on a trailer to make the weight legal.  Then make sure it can clear the bridge or weight of the bridge.  I probable spent 2 hours today just planning the load, permits, spread, tie down ratings, route to take.

Then I had to take a 120 foot long vehicle down 130km of dirt roads that switch backed up a mountain with a trailer that also steers.  In a 50 year old truck that I have to maintain and know how to work on myself.


Some driving jobs they load the trailer for you, then you set cruise control and stare at a freeway.  Company makes all the decisions for you.  These jobs require no intelligence.  Although some of the smartest people I’ve met have done these jobs."
"6.5c off peak (7pm-7am), 9.4c mid peak (7am-11am,5pm-7pm), 13.2c  on peak (11am-5pm)."
This was basically the experience I had as well at the Scottsdale Fashion Square location. At this point I'm just getting everything together to see if the math makes sense to make a decision.

"Incorrect.

OA: Hourly also, commissions ONLY if you hit your targets."
"Maybe they make commission and it's just in their description to not be a predator to customers.

And thank you for being a good, no pressure salesman. We need more people like you"
"Health benefits yes. Massages, chiro, dental, the whole 9. Hourly is decent, definitely higher than minimum wage, but even a company like Tesla falls below the old ""better to get hired than work there for a long time to make better hourly"" routine.

The incentive is A) the ability to keep your job, B) feeling good about hitting targets, and C) if you don't hit quoats, you don't get commission, and are basically only working for hourly. "

"True - it's one of those 'oh yeah what if' or after a string of robberies concepts they'll have to address. 

The repercussions of new tech fascinates the hell out of me - not so much disrupting but adjusting to new realities."
"Simulating a signal would not be difficult to obscure the fact the truck or convoy was taken.

Consider this: Car manufacturers are already having issues with used 'smart cars', where the previous owner still has control of different aspects of the vehicle sold - there is no process to make this data/control method automated when the vehicle is sold..
This being said, manufacturers are selling vehicles with less infosec than your average Dell workstation, and you know how those are compromised on a daily basis."
"It was. Strictly a highway. Almost ran a red light (it would have if I didn’t stop it) and crossed over into the other lane when to a human, the lane was very visible and definable. Also, merging wasn’t the most comfortable experience either. "

That’s tight. This was literally the first good counter argument in my opinion. I could see that making a large impact for sure. This definitely sounds close.

"I work in the trucking industry. I constantly hear about the huge shortage of drivers. There are billboards and tv commercials. There are idle trucks with no drivers.

But the fact is, the shortage is _at a certain price_. If the industry was willing to pay more, then they would have more drivers. 

There is great demand for drivers _at a low rate_. There is very low demand for drivers with good pay."
Just funny to think that maybe 150 years from now at the Automotive Shipping Museum only Fred and Martha can move the displays because they are one of the handful of people who know how to drive an old fashion semi.
"That is true, sophisticated cyber crimes would be possible but of course trucking companies would respond with encrypted data signals, hardened software, redundant systems and such is the typical cyber arms race we see today for valuable assets. I was more thinking more of the common crime scenario - that two guys in a pickup with spray paint for the cameras cut off trucks and loading up on their cargo. Both would be possible but the first is technically challenging and the second would face the “quick alert” issue in the original post."
"Dude it's not autonomous, it's just fancy cruise control for now. It doesn't read signs, it doesn't read traffic lights. READ THE FUCKING MANUAL BEFORE YOU KILL YOURSELF OR OTHERS WITH 2 TONS OF METAL"
"It won’t stop for red lights, it’s not programmed to.

As for crossing over lanes, I don’t know anything about the road conditions so I can’t really comment.

It’s not supposed to be able to merge yet either.

Frankly, from what you’ve just told me, a more accurate description would be to say that you irresponsibly overstretched the capabilities of the software, expecting it to be capable of parts of the driving task that it’s not programmed to be capable of (yet). That’s dangerous - and it’s on you."
I'm almost positive autopilot will not stop for a red light.
"I second the comment “read the manual”... the Tesla Enhanced Auto Pilot is not designed to recognize traffic lights and no merge capabilities so both of these situations should have had you in control. 

As recently announced, new computer for autonomous driving has been built but needs to be added to every vehicle through a service visit and once regulatory approvals are given, limited autonomous driving features will be introduced over time... 

Read the manual."
"In the semi announcement they specified the system is 'ready to go now, not something that's future development'. Obviously that's Elon speak but the idea is they link together with VERY close following distance. No gaps for people to cut into, they all link together for controls so they dont slam into eachother and then just follow the leader.  

Great for aero efficiency - I know a bunch of people have been asking about convoy support for S/3/X so they can drift off transports for range + virtually autonomous driving... no word on that though."
"Waymo is able to sort of ""demonstrate"" that model today, carrying passengers in their trial programme, though I don't buy that they're doing as well as they market it (as you say, driving is a very difficult task). But seeing what they can do now, I think a 10-year time frame for pre-planned and geo-fenced services within cities or towns is reasonable."
"Well god damnit, I’ve been led to believe Ontario (the province) was amongst the highest in the world in terms of rates."
"Are there a lot of fees added on top or do you just pay 12 cents / kWh used? 

On an average bill in Ontario ~40% is the kWh usage and 60% is “Regulatory Charges” some of those charges are based on usage too, so the total cost could be more per kWh in the end. "
"Actually it does. If we owe Xy amount in taxes for the year we can write off A percentage of the vehicle bc it fits certain tax law (yes there’s a law that lets business owners write off the entire cost of a vehicle of over a certain weight and the X does fit that) basically buying a X for 100k... write off 50k of the price (instead of paying that to Uncle Sam)... buy a 100k car in reality for 50k. That’s EXACTLY how the tax law worked out. Math in fact DOES apply.

Brain wrap! Oh man the memories!
When I was projection supervisor I came in at 6 am to find a print going across the entire theater. Apparently the projectionist and his trainee dropped the core and had the brilliant idea of running the head onto the platter and the tail onto the speed reeler...at the same time. It got so insanely tangled that they were there all night untangling it and had to run it out across the theater. 
"I would *love* to try... However I need written authorization first for pentesting... Laws, all that... lol"
"Yeah. And what I’m saying is fancy cruise control needs quite a few updates before truck drivers are out of business. I think that’s a fair assessment. Obviously, I did stop for the light, and I was paying attention so I’d say I was fine. I’ll let you do all the manual reading though. Usually driving a car doesn’t require reading a manual first. "
"Maybe so, and again, in a rural area so it was easy to remain safe for myself and others. That being said, merging happens frequently while driving, Red lights are also a thing, what I’m saying is that if we’re not even to this point yet, I believe we’re much further from autonomous driving than we’d all like to think. Maybe this is the wrong sub to post this because some of you guys are so sold on autonomous driving being “so close you can almost taste it,” but all I’m saying is that the profession of driving a semi truck isn’t going anywhere any time soon. "
"Totally man. I’ll definitely start reading manuals prior to everything I do now. I’ll make sure to read the manual on how to take a shower in the morning tomorrow as well. Would you happen to have a copy of the manual on how to brush your teeth? I seem to have lost that one. Oh. And while we’re at it, I’m going to start reading user end license agreements on software. Sounds realistic for sure. "
"Hopefully someone with experience in logistics can chime in but the more I think about convoy trucking like this the more I can see external factors outweighing the gains it does provide. For example, let’s say you have 5 trailers of cargo going to the same location. They’ll all need to be loaded/unloaded at the same time otherwise it’ll hold back trailers from getting back on the road while waiting on the rest to be loaded or unloaded. Some times a client can only take one truck at a time and can take forever loading or unloading a trailer. This wait can cause the one driver to miss out on doing another delivery or two before their maximum hours are met. Would more deliveries have been possible in that day with each truck having its own driver?

In the case of cross country trips, one truck breaking down or popping a tire will hold back the other trailers until it is repaired and that might take several hours or more. Sending out a driver for that one truck while the others get back on the road might take even longer because it all happened on I-70 between Salina and Grand Junction. There’s also the time lost doing the pre trip inspection for each truck each time and the difficulty of finding parking for 5 trucks so the driver can get their mandated rest. Charging the trucks will be another set back if you’re unable to charge all of them at the same time too. 

What happens to the convoy if 2 or 3 of the trucks make it through a green light but it turns red on the rest? There’s also the issue of the distance between two traffic lights being shorter than the overall length of the convoy and the lights not changing at the same time. The convoy will either have to block an intersection or allow a gap which will give other traffic the ability to get between the convoy. Pulling over to wait for them to catch back up may not be physically or legally possible. 

I’m not saying the convoy with one driver can’t work to be a benefit but I’d honestly like to see how they’d overcome these situations. I’m sure a truck driver or logistics person can think of other scenarios or ways to overcome them. "
I hope you’re right. I’d rather be wrong here. 
The lowest tier here in CA through PG&E on the standard plan is $0.21 USD per kwh.  High tier is $0.44 per kwh iirc.
"Goodness, no. In Germany they pay 0.30EUR per kWh (0.35USD). Here are some stats for EU countries: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Electricity_price_statistics"
"Ah, well, here's my last bill for 467 kWh (before I got my PHEV haha)

Note that it's the same rate no matter what time of day.  Now other utilities can have time of use rates, but not this one.

This is also a coop utility so at the end of the year they figure out their ""profit"" and set aside some of it into a future capital expenditure fund, and put the rest into a credit for each customer that is pro-rated to usage.  However, you don't actually get that money back until you cancel service, drop dead, or whenever the trustees decide to issue refunds (every couple of years)

ps, looks like I pay more like 13.5 cents a kwh actually (I didn't do the math)"
"so...this can be done on any luxury car and is not exclusive to Tesla.

The point you're trying to make is pointless. Anyone can run the ""math"" on a 50-60k luxury car....."
People like you are the reason for an ever increasing amount of much too obvious safety labels. 
">I think that’s a fair assessment

No it's not and you're not seeing anything past your nose.

&#x200B;

Stopping for red lights is an example of a problem where 100% success is required. If the software works 99.99% of the time currently, that's still not good enough and it won't be released to Teslas. They might be working on the extreme cases and be close to reaching success and you would have absolutely no clue. Or they might be at 70% success rate currently and be very, very far from full self-driving. Either way, saying that you can judge how far away they are by just driving a Tesla is not a fair assessment and rather stupid."
"You said


>Almost ran a red light (it would have if I didn’t stop it) 


But since it literally *doesn't do that*, it didn't almost run anything, *you* almost ran a red light.  I get that you're trying to backtrack and save face, but I'm pretty sure everyone is well aware you had no idea what you were doing."
"While yes Tesla haven't been programmed to handle that, there are other autonomous systems that can. Waymo for example is an autonomous taxi service that doesn't have a driver at all "
As stated above. Red lights are not covered by autopilot and you should have encountered any if you used it properly and on the highway only.
"I think the extreme edge case of 5 trailers is not likely to happen. The main advantage will be dealing with 2-3 trailers. I would envision it being used for deliveries between fulfillment centers.  

Lets assume a major company like Amazon and two fairly major cities ~300 miles apart (well within single charge range). The chances of having more than 1 truck going between those centers is pretty large. Driving a semi with 2 following ~2-3 feet behind you is not significantly different from driving a dual trailer truck. When you throw in the insane difference in responsiveness electric motors have, it becomes pretty damn easy to navigate edge cases like you describe.   

TL-DR: If a big dual trailer diesel can navigate those situations a 2-3 string of electric semis will probably fare better because they dont take a full minute to get up to speed causing all sorts of traffic issues. When no second or third truck is needed, you just use the single vehicle as normal. It's not a direct cut of X% labor needed but it makes it much more profitable when dealing with common mass deliveries between fulfillment centers. "
I thought coal was cheap?
"Well, for comparison, [here’s mine](https://imgur.com/a/W9orZBt) we had used 318 kWh this period and our bill was only a few dollars less (not including exchange rates). 

I did make a mistake above, it’s delivery charges, not regulatory, that make up the majority of the fees. 

Tax and all, we paid ~ 19 cents per kWh that period. 

"
"Actually as I stated the law only applies to vehicles over a certain weight! That’s actually 6,000lbs and the only other vehicle is the hummer which is discontinued! So you are wrong. It does only apply right now to the model X. Do some research before arguing about something u clearly didn’t research the way we did: we spoke with our tax professional. The law is clear. And TESLA SERVICE\SALES CENTER EMPLOYEES WERE AWARE AND KNOWLEDGEABLE OF THE LAW AS WELL. Look it up for yourself ffs."
That was a totally clever statement! Let’s hear more!!!! I see you like to live life very safely. Do you ever take your helmet off or do you leave it on in public every day?
"Then tell me other ways of assessing our future capabilities for autonomous driving. I’ve already spoken with the Future Predicting Gypsies, they tell me that it isn’t going to happen within the next ten years. Also too, r/futurology says that it’ll happen tomorrow so we know how valid they are. Should I keep asking Reddit experts such as yourself? I mean, you seem to be an expert in futurology. I know my assessment must be “rather stupid” by testing autonomous driving with one of the few autonomy examples in a beta version. We must be really close to all truck drivers loosing their jobs huh?!"
Stoplights exist on highways. Maybe not on freeways but on highways they exist. 
"Ha, looks like a tie.  19 cents CAD is about 14 cents USD.   

BUT BUT BUT -- You at least have an option to charge off-peak to pull your rate down -- which looks like you're doing a pretty good job of! 

But getting back to original point, no doubt your gasoline is more than U.S. so it's still more beneficial for Walmart to buy electric vehicles in Canada rather than US. 

"
"I see I struck a nerve, haha. "
Right I was thinking freeways but still the system is not yet set up to handle stop lights and one should still be paying attention to the road.
"I think the issue is your definition of highway - here a highway (at least in the way the word is generally used) is a limited access road with on/off ramps and no intersections. That's where auto pilot is meant to be used.  

It's not meant to handle anything that requires turning between roads, reacting to stop sighs/lights or handling intersections of any kind. "
"Yeah, pretty close in the end! I guess we are both getting screwed haha. 

We do try and wait until “off peak” to run energy hungry appliances and are typically at work during “peak” times so that helps. 

But yes, your fuel is cheaper, even with the exchange rate. Can’t wait to see some Tesla Semis on the 400 series highways in Ontario! "
"I was just bringing to light that your comment wasn’t clever, but more of a statement that a “neck-bearded” person would find intelligent. "
"That’s fine. I agree. I was paying attention but hey, if they can’t even handle that yet, we’re still a long ways away. "
What you’re describing is a freeway. Not a highway. 
"Nor is your story of expecting results outside of what the car is programmed to do, which is written in the safety notice in plain English. Then using your experience of endangering of other road users with your recklessness to interpret the current state of autonomous driving research. A much better argument for the complexity of self driving would be that 2 years after autopilot 2 release Tesla's own software still doesn't read speed limit signs like autopilot 1 made by mobileye, and has to rely on map data. "
"Yeah I agree. While not having used it myself, I do like the idea of the system both keeping me in my lane and keeping me a safe distance from the car in front of me (I love adaptive cruise control on my Ford).

Supposedly there are more self driving features coming out real soon and I look forward to seeing those."
And I'm saying how the term is usually used - freeway isn't a word that's literally ever used here. When someone is talking about a highway they are generally not talking about some local 4 lane road.
Oh absolutely. The safety features of the car being able to react much faster is so useful. It’s super cool. Don’t get me wrong. I agree 100%
