Man I want to go satin grey with my midnight silver.  Looks so cherry!
This looks amazing. Help me out here cuz I’m a noob: does the wrap offer additional protection to the car (ie make it slightly more resistant to scratches or makes it  easier to clean)?
"It looks amazing. I need more angles, more pictures please.

That car just needs some new shoes."
"Ever since they made Pearl white the default, I told myself I would probably get a wrap on my Pearl white if I start seeing waay too many on the streets. This satin grey would be my choice of wrap."
Sexy!
"Crap, that’s hot. Which manufacturer’s film is that? It’s the exact color I’ll pick when I get my black lemur wrapped..."
Ok now remove the aeros and we're in business
and tinted windows?
"Oh my God it's gorgeous, now I have to email Elon to add this to the model 3 options."
What was the original color of your Model 3? Will the final result look as good if your vehicle is maybe pearl white?
"Graham. Thanks for the vids man. They're really helping my S.O. & I smash, occasionally. :)"
"Best model 3 I’ve seen. Never thought I’d consider a wrap until I saw this. In my opinion this makes the Aeros work better than the larger wheels. Looks so futuristic. I’m thinking I might get a TM3 in UK maybe 10-12 months time. Usually keep a car 10+ years, so not wanting expense of replacing wrap. Do they ever last a long time or is it just 3-4 years? Thanks. And amazing looking 3.

More pics please."
Appreciate the reply and the time!
"This looks gorgeous!  Well done, sir"

"Disagree, the aeros look even better and more futuristic here. Dig this with a back hoe."
I don’t quite get this. The white is a very good look. A red Ferrari is still a red Ferrari.
"But this guy has satin gray, so looks like that's out for you Mr. Exclusive."

Satin and matte films do not get washed just like paint. You can't use any filler/polymeres or you will see streaking. Best to get a matte/satin specific car wash and that's the only step you do.  That's the beauty of matte films you don't do anything to them except wash and dry.
"This.

Although I don’t know anyone who owns a Ferrari, it’s hard to imagine they would want to cover up the red simply because there are many of them out there.

Besides, I use my M3 as a daily driver. A car, nothing more, nothing less. I paid extra for the color because I like blue cars. Have never thought about covering it up just because there are “too many” of them out there..."
That looks amazing.  Mind me asking how much?
Thanks!
do you have white interior?

That sounds a lot cheaper than I’ve seen others post for a full wrap. Where are you located?

Mind PMing me the shop. The delete sounds like a great deal. I wonder if they do calipers.
Who else wants to see a Wendy's vs Tesla Twitter throwdown?
"The follow up [tweet](https://twitter.com/tesla/status/1148338316917399552?s=21) is pretty cool too:

> (but obviously make sure they're still safe to drive, and also obviously don't actually peer-pressure your elderly relatives into anything you monsters, obviously)"
"The guy who now does their Twitter used to do the Twitter for the Museum of English Rural Life. https://mobile.twitter.com/TheMERL

He was one of the first to show museums that they can have a personality online. He would have fun showing artworks of large cattle and other words this from their archives.

Then a few months back, him and Elon got into a Twitter ""argument"" where Elon stole a picture from MERL and the museum 'rebranded' as something like museum of rural Elon, and then the guy announced a few weeks later he was going to tesla."
You can only peer pressure your peers ...
Their follow up tweet is even more likable.
"Oh man, my great great great aunt is pushing 111, still drives, and loves fast red cars.  I worry encouraging her is borderline unethical at this point.  But come on, it's internet points!"

"“Tesla failed to match delivery expectations in Q2”


....... by beating them!!!"
"The S/X deliveries were impressive compared to expectations, which in some ways is better than Model 3 deliveries because of the margins that help them stay in the black."
I am sorry this clearly must be a lie.  The shorts have told me that there is no demand for these cars and they can't even produce 5000 cars per week.  /S
"“Tesla is facing increased competition for the high-end electric sports car market as automakers from Ford to Jaguar invest billions of dollars to develop their own electric lineups. Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz began taking orders in May for new battery-electric vehicles with plans to roll out more models in the coming years. Jaguar’s I-Pace all-electric SUV swept industry awards at the New York Auto Show in April.”

Why do they have to include this in Tesla delivery article??
Cnbc is totally ridiculous."
"CNBC still managed to put in a negative tone at the end, no surprises there."
"I would click the link but it's a CNBC article, so there's no chance I'm doing that."
"One out of four cars sold in June in Norway were Teslas. Those are not EV numbers, but total car numbers."
"7% Stock surge  niiiiice 

So glad I bought a little bit more stock when it hit $180"
Must have been so painful for cnbc to write a title like this
"I’m glad to be 2/95,200. Hope for more delivery records to come. :)"
Was so happy with my P3D delivery that I decided to put $$ down @ $220
91k expected? i thought they expect 70k.  lift expectation to stage for a artificial miss as always
"Tesla had 95,200 deliveries and produced 87,000. The fact that they delivered more than they produced is very important, this fact sets them up very well for positive operating cash flow.

A big reason the stock fell in Q1 was because they posted -600 million in operating cash flow. If they turn this positive, that will be a very big deal."
There’s still zero signs of demand. It’s going to $10/stock.     /s
When the Chinese production line opens up delivery numbers are going to look super SEXY
M'uh shorts
"Even the 91,000 expected is analysts moving the goalposts quite a bit. I remember a month ago expected deliveries were in the 70,000 range. Just goes to show how much “analysts” really know."
"Raw numbers are from:

* https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-q2-2019-vehicle-production-deliveries

|       | Production | Deliveries |
|:-----|-------------:|------------:|
|Model S/X|14,517|17,650|
|Model 3|72,531|77,550|

There's one [ship](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:465649) that left SFO 6/21 and will arrive in China 7/9."
One of those was me! Glad I did my part.
"Now all of a sudden everyone was expecting 91,000...smh."
"Uh oh Tesla is doomed!! Do they even have any cars left to sell???

/s"
short squeeze in 3...2...1..
"Financial analyst: Sure this quarter completely blew out Wall Street predictions, but this colossal miss by people who get paid to have some idea of what's going on doesn't really matter.  What matters is NEXT quarter.  That's the important one.  And if Tesla meets or exceeds expectations then we'll just shrug and claim that the NEXT quarter is the one that matters.  It's genius."
"The negative spin will be ""Customers racing to get the remaining tax break."""
"I don’t think the vertical integration is not there for these competitors. The software, hardware and expanse network of superchargers are way ahead of competition."
Is it too late to buy more stock?
Since when did they expect 91?  Thought they were low balling at 75
Mine was one of them!
Seriously why are we still posting cnbc articles?
"Why you post cnbc news, just don't give them clicks.

Great Tesla congrats you are the best company in the world!"
"Pretty awesome numbers... and when the former emperor of Detroit,  Bob Lutz capitulates, and says the TM3 is a well made vehicle, you know things are changing fast.  

After shilling for so long about Tesla’s abject failure, he does not want to be caught strictly on the side of “irrelevant” and not knowing what hes talking about, as a new era of automotive business dawns on him."
"Yep, definitely about to go bust, or broke, or some other shit those arse hats always say about Tesla!  Sigh!"
Hmmmm.    This CNBC article failed to mention the Bolt stealing Model 3 sales.  I swear I used to read that somewhere.
 Musk delivers
"Tesla is great but they need to hurry the f up with their infrastructure and service side. Takes about a month for a bumper to be replaced. Took me a week to get a broken window changed out.

This type of service is just ridiculous.

The car is awesome though."

I saw the Tesla SUV model (3 maybe??) TOWING a fucking CAMPER down the highway today. I was like omg
"They're arguably about as well off as they have ever been, which means not very.

There are a good number of ipace and E-trons around where I live. My impression is that the E-tron is better than the ipace, and that both have nicer interior experiences than Tesla but trail Tesla by a lot technically.

If they had tesla drivetrains and supercharger access, the E-tron would be a good car. (but waaay to big and clumsy for my Model 3 performance tastes)."
"> But they won't be able you sustain this output.

*...stock plummets.* ^/s"
"4,200 more than expected. 4,200... 420. Oh Elon."
"Wow, 95,000z. I bet they made a lot of money last quarter selling so many cars."
"That's an impressive total for Q2. Assuming that the average battery pack in those 95,200 vehicles is 70KWh, that's 6.664GWh worth of output from Gigafactory 1.  IIRC the current production from GF1 is about 24GWh per year. So 4 quarters of production at the Q2 rate will require more than the entire current annual output of GF1. In that battery status report from the most recent shareholder meeting, I think Elon said that GF1 is trying to reach 35GWh before the end of 2019, but my impression is that this goal may be out of reach at present.

https://www.electrive.com/2019/04/15/tesla-and-panasonic-musk-unsatisfied-as-35-gwh-not-yet-achieved/

My guess is that Q3 and Q4 production will be around 85,000 units each."
I have been seeing more and more teslas in my area. It makes me so happy to see that Tesla is growing and what seems to be rapidly. I just wish I lived somewhere that I could have a charger so that I too could have my own tesla.
"This is really good news. My biggest hope for automotive is that Tesla can become a truly massive volume manufacturer.

Hey bmw
"Tesla was aiming to deliver 155,000 cars in Q1 2019. 96,000 is behind, but not that far behind. I have no doubt by next year they'll be doing 500k cars/year at least."
"I know Elon Musk likes to announce good news, but Tesla would probably get a lot more favorable business press if he always kept expectations just below reality so that Tesla was exceeding expectations every quarter. I can just imagine the news headlines if he had announced Tesla might deliver almost 96,000 cars this quarter."
Not bad at all!
And the stock closed down today....Edit: but is up significantly in after hours trading!
"OK, now reel the other automakers so they are dependent on Tesla batteries. 

These bad boys are 20% better than the competition and cheaper. More over the Tesla battery energy density is getting better.

Contributor was Lora Kolodney
It’s because CNBC has a remarkable track record of being anti-Tesla
Because it’s a fact. And it’s relevant to the article. That’s why. It’s not some damned conspiracy for crying out loud.
"All ""journalists"" have agendas."
Because they're geared towards people with an interest in finance and this is something you'd want to know when exploring Tesla stock?
"The hyper focus on delivery numbers from Tesla is insane. Under deliver by a car and all these bullshit commentators are spouting off how they will be bankrupt in six months, overdeliver by a car and Tesla’s stock soars to records. Everyone needs to chill the fuck out and adopt a realistic middle ground position"
"CNBC parent company is going to be disrupted by SpaceX with Starlink, so this could be ant-Musk rather than anti-Tesla. The I-Pace is seen as inefficient, short range and lacking tech. So definitely a car 1.0 still. I don’t think it will sell in any numbers and it would not sell at all unless it had  the Jaguar brand behind it."
I've seen more I paces in the last few months than Model X's in years in the UK. So they are actually doing quite well to be fair
Is CNBC living in a different dimension?
Every time. They just don’t know what to make of Tesla
u/uwutranslator
They include it because of the blatant demand problem tesla had for the first and second quarter.
"Not sure about the rhetoric, the only thing outperforming the Tesla powertrain (world’s only open source design too if you count the patents’ transparency) is fictional, probably helium-3 or metallic hydrogen. And those have to take off from the ground first to reach the right specific impulse."
Literally scum. How much are they getting paid to run a 24/7 antiTesla agenda?
What surprises me is the iron of having a cnbc article as the main post on the front page of this sub when the delivery numbers vindicate Tesla against everything cnbc has been saying to smear them. How about we stop sharing and ignore these unscrupulous media outlets that lie and deceive on a daily basis?
"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/27/ford-cutting-another-12000-european-jobs-as-restructuring-continues.html

They took negative news from Ford and made it into a story about how every company is in the same position.

A balanced article would’ve at least mentioned that while the other companies are cutting jobs Tesla is opening a few factory in China and is searching for a site in Europe."

"Here's the text of the article so you don't have to click it

&#x200B;

Tesla shares surged Tuesday after the electric auto maker said it shattered its previous production and delivery records during the second quarter, soundly beating analysts’ estimates.

&#x200B;

The company’s stock jumped by about 7% in after-market trading. Tesla also hinted at a strong third quarter, saying it’s entering the period with a backlog of orders.

&#x200B;

CEO Elon Musk set investors’ expectations high in a companywide email on June 25, saying the electric car maker was on course to deliver a record number of vehicles throughout the quarter. He wasn’t exaggerating. The company delivered 95,200 cars during the the three months ending June 30 — a 51.1% increase over an admittedly weak first quarter and besting its previous record of 90,700 deliveries set in the fourth quarter of 2018.

&#x200B;

Tesla’s deliveries are a closely watched industry number and the nearest reflection of sales, showing how many cars were actually delivered to customers.

&#x200B;

“Challenges remain, but this is a step in the right direction,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. “The numbers were above even the bull estimates and shows a clear rebound for the company. This is a feather in the cap for Tesla.”

&#x200B;

Tesla’s deliveries also blew away analysts’ estimates of 91,000, according to data compiled by FactSet. A disappointing 63,000 vehicles were delivered during the first three months of the year, when Tesla was plagued by challenges transporting cars from its factory in Fremont, California, across the world as well as questions about waning customer demand.

&#x200B;

“In addition, we made significant progress streamlining our global logistics and delivery operations at higher volumes, enabling cost efficiencies and improvements to our working capital position,” the company said in announcing its results.

Tesla’s orders aren’t fully reflected in its delivery numbers until a buyer takes possession of their new car. The company said 7,400 vehicles were still in transit, but not yet delivered, during the second quarter. Those sales will show up in its third-quarter report.

&#x200B;

Tesla is facing increased competition for the high-end electric sports car market as automakers from Ford to Jaguar invest billions of dollars to develop their own electric lineups. Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz began taking orders in May for new battery-electric vehicles with plans to roll out more models in the coming years. Jaguar’s I-Pace all-electric SUV swept industry awards at the New York Auto Show in April.

&#x200B;

Deliveries for the company’s biggest seller, the Model 3, were 77,550 compared with 74,100 estimated by analysts. Combined deliveries for the Model S sedans and Model X SUVs were 17,650, also beating estimates of 16,600, according to FactSet data.

&#x200B;

“Delivery numbers are important, but we need to see the tea leaves look good for the second half,” Ives said in an interview. Tesla’s production target for the year is “still an Everest task, especially with competition coming at them from all angles. The real question is going to be, is this sustainable?”

&#x200B;

Tesla told investors in April it expected to “deliver between 90,000 and 100,000 vehicles in Q2. Although it is possible to deliver a higher number of vehicles.”

&#x200B;

The company also recently lost one of its top manufacturing executives at its Fremont plant, Peter Hochholdinger, who was vice president of production.

&#x200B;

Tesla’s stock has lost almost a third of its value over the last year and the company’s market cap is at about $40 billion."
"Yup, same. I just came for the comments."
I'm out of the loop here. Can you explain? I don't watch/read CNBC so I don't get it
"BC, Canada has some decent numbers as well. I think TSLA hit 10%. But the government decided that the ev credit wasn't feasible, so now rather than them giving you $800 you have to pay $1200 net car sales tax.  super lame."
"Good numbers from Germany too, relatively speaking. They delivered 1605 cars in June."
"Ha I did the same! Congrats.

Just took delivery of my blue M3 LR RWD. 
While doing test-drive etc, I could see the stories about demand problem were fake. Easy decision :)"
"I did the same. I was like ""with the model 3 coming plus the semi which could be MASSIVE and the competition is still about 3-5 years behind Tesla is all areas. It is a sound investment."" Also it was with money from a stock buy out that I didn't know I had.

Riding that 180 dollars per share to 800-1000 per share or a split."

"I'm saving up a 20% down payment for a Model 3 in the next 6 months, and part of that is small investments in stocks. Hope I get the chance to buy Tesla stocks when they're down and sell when they're up before I need the funds to actually buy one!"
It definitely musk have
Their Oil and gas overlords won’t be happy
Makes it better that suddenly they were expecting 91k over previous estimates
Considering reopening my Model Y order....just dont want to risk early adopter issues again haha.
"You bought 2 Teslas last quarter? Wow! Mr. Moneybags, here. :)"
"Nice! I bought more at $260 when I got my tax refund, right before it tanked lol"
"I believe Tesla expected 91k, CNBC expected 70k."
"The news will be out soon to spin it as a negative, somehow."
Huge observation.  Nice!
"$10 for the entire stock???? I would take it, if it wasn't for the mountain of debt and worthless cars I'd be left with.

edit: this post was sarcasm, but to be honest, it's really amusing to see how people react when they don't catch it."
Don't you mean S3XY?
"And Model 3 over 24 months:

* `260+2425+9766+28578+53239+61394+62950+72531` = **291143** production
* `222+1542+8182+18449+56065+63359+50900+77550` = **276269** deliveries

Giving a delta of 14,874 as shipping/display/homologation/crash-test; and a *maximum* of 7,400^([S/3/X total]) of those described as ""in transit""."
12 week quarter? 6000 model 3s per week?
"If you read the official release from Tesla, they count all manufactured cars that have been matched to a customer but not yet delivered as ""in transit"". So it's not just that one ship."
There's gotta be a ship or two getting ready for New Zealand and Australia some time soon.
Which they still beat. Critics need to be remembered for their misses.
They have whole untapped continents. I'm excited.
That's true though. Yet we've still got six more months of some credit.
"the spin is, ""demand will be dead for tesla in 6 months while all their competitors still have their tax breaks."""
Would you want to take a road trip without the supercharger network? Sounds very unpleasant.
"Long term, not late at all."
Congrats! I'll probably have to buy a second one because my wife took mine :(
"I don't go to CNBC, but i know from this site that they change their tune as they want to.  They have their own pundits/personalities that they publish expectations of 70,000 deliveries, but come time for some good news they find some no name who decided that 91,000 deliveries are the expectation.  

Its not a lie, but if this is how they report on straight numbers its a good indicator for how reliable they are about more sensitive info."
Sounds like an Onion headline.
"Yeah noticing more and more QA issues. Been pretty vocal about the cabin noise, but now my autopilot only works 50% of the time and I can't get anyone to come out until mid-July. Been waiting for a windshield from safelite for 3 weeks just to be told I had to call Tesla but I can't even get anyone on the phone."
"Given how fast they're expanding, I'm not surprised, especially since they aren't going to want to tie up capital warehousing parts."
Numbers were post-market
"They didn't, they ""share sourced"" their patents. Meaning you can use ours but we can then use yours as well."
"Now take that $2k and buy the underlying stock with it! Call options didn't help TSLA, it's a zero sum game--someone sold you those options and lost out. Unless of course it was one of those up to no good short sellers out there who sold you the call options. Take as much money from them as you want."
What
"The ""u"" must be lowercase for the ping to work, like this: u/FredTesla."
M’y sources were only about NA deliveries - not global deliveries
"It's too early for Maxwell, expect a pack full of 2170s."
Definitely not Maxwell
And maybe a cabin refresh. While by car standards it’s incredibly modern the 3 has a better setup than the S and X right now.
There is no 400 mile range Model S later this year. I believe that to be  a malicious rumor designed to make people hold their purchase for the new car.
Let us hope they lose their shorts for months and years to come.
From Tesla down the road
Probably from used Teslas.
"Probably the same place as BMW, which means they'll be very expensive for the range they offer so the vehicles will either have a low range or be unreasonably expensive, or both. And we're not even considering the lack of a dedicated charging network. I guess they'll just be the work-home-groceries vehicles that are charged at home for the few people who can afford them but don't want Teslas?"
"

Panasonic/LG Chem will licence to whomever has the best return proposition for them.  They may incubate certain projects and brands but the end is still about market dominance and profit. 

China will leverage access to its domestic market for transfers of technology. Hopefully driving costs down in the long run."
https://northvolt.com/
"From the battery faerie obviously.

Never mind the missing charging infrastructure and tedious software updates via OBD cable..."
"It's a distinct possibility... they've been looking a bit shaky lately, and I don't think the I-Pace can be profitable in a world where Tesla beat them to market by a few years."
"JLR as a whole isn't doing too well, but they're being propped up by tata so they shouldn't be disappearing any time soon. They've just announced an EV partnership with BMW."
I hear they have demand issues.
"Passed an ICE Jaguar on the side of the highway yesterday with smoke billowing from the engine. So scary!  
Haven’t seen anything about that risk in the news, I would think the media would want that out there to warn the public!"
"> Jaguar? Aren't they going bankrupt?

Speaking of, have you all looked at the I-Pace on Jaguar’s website? It’s pretty funny. It’s the third one in, right behind the E-Pace and the F-pace. There also is not much that let’s you know it’s the hot new EV until you click on it.

Now if I was looking for a new hot EV I’d probably think it was the E pace right? Nope! Maybe the second? Also no. It’s like they are purposely trying to be confusing, similar to GM and Volt/Bolt situation.

What are the chances they actually want to sell these cars? Verrrry low it seems. Do they think they’re gonna “kill Tesla” by not trying? It’s a strange situation."
"No one buys their ICE vehicles, why would anyone want their ev?"
"Weirdly I see plenty of Jags around where I am, most only a year or two old. Though I am in the UK, everywhere else appears to be the opposite. I see multiple Jags per day while I see a Tesla about once a month."
"No lol. What an ignorant thing to say. JLR make profits most quarters and are coming of the back of records sales.

Also the iPace is selling above budget so they’re happy with it"
[deleted]
cause they invested half a billion in Rivian recently
Ford is more likely to succeed in the EV game than Jaguar! Hahahaha
If Tesla fails... the industry would use that to prove their own thesis that nobody wants EVs and EV technology isn't ready.  So you can keep all that nonsense.  Tesla needs to dominate and continue to embarrass the legacy players really until some eventually die.  I could live without GM I recon.
"What makes you believe/think that?  Has he come out and said it, or is this just projection?"
"Not in sales. And the iPace did get all the awards, because automotive journalists still don’t know how to really review an EV. They don’t understand that in an EV, efficiency is king. Only Tesla and Hyundai/Kia get that at the moment"
"The iPace is selling double of the X or S in Europe, YTD."

They they paid millions in ad revenue from all the big car companies. Tesla pays them 0.
"The vast majority of people who make their living predicting the performance of public companies are literally no better than random.  This is why index funds beat nearly all mutual funds over the long term.

I honestly think that they hate Tesla because they have been so wrong for so long it exposes them all as the frauds they are."
however much the Kochs pay them.
"It's what they're already being paid. Mercedes, Ford, and Shell are major advertisers. You don't publish material that could reduce your customer's ability to keep paying you. Just got to love corporate ""news."""
Tesla doesn't buy ads on CNBC. Other car makers do.
"Did Tesla not lose Peter Hochholdinger? Did their stock not lose a ton of value over the past year?

Both of those things are very relevant to the article. The fact that Tesla is able to hit these numbers despite the loss of a manufacturing exec is encouraging, but if it’s symptomatic of culture issues at the company, Tesla may face manufacturing issues in the future.

Pointing out that Tesla’s stock price has suffered over the past year is also not a bad thing for Tesla. If the stock price is lower than it should be then CNBC is drawing attention to an investment opportunity. If it’s not lower than it should be, then CNBC is simply peppering this otherwise rosy story with a thorny reminder that all is not well at Tesla.

The last two blurbs are instances of CNBC providing information that may be interpreted positively or negatively. It’s true that Tesla has been facing problems that have driven down its stock price, and if CNBC were to publish a piece without acknowledging the numerous problems they’ve had recently, it would be much more of a propaganda piece than it is now."

"Basically there has been a very significant anti-Tesla bias displayed by CNBC (amongst several others) in their reporting on the company. This has been noticed by a large number of people, including myself. As a result, I have stopped reading their articles or watching their channel."
Let’s make it more difficult for people to switch over to a vehicle that helps achieve the goal of lower emissions that the entire world is trying to meet. Backwards.

"Headline ""Tesla missed CNBC's delivery target of 70,000 by over 25,000 deliveries"""
"My guess the media will spin it as:

* 380800 a year, what happened to 500k Elon tweeted by the end of the year (media will forget there is a shanghai factory online by the end of the year)
* 95200 delivered because people are hurried before the tax rebate halfs again.   There will be no demand next quarter.
* 10000 of the orders are undelivered car from last quarter, so this number is sandbagged."
I know I hate that.  It's like somehow the oil industry has the news sources in their pockets.  Oh wait..... They do....
"man, I love my worthless car"
Okay.
"Hey Man, no one cares that you’re upset"
"I understand that, just putting some of the transit numbers in context.  There's a huge chunk of that number currently floating in the ocean.  The last two ships that arrived to China or Europe was 6/21 - those SHOULD have been delivered by Sunday.  The rest is probably Canadian and American deliveries."
"Haha, it sure does."
yep. it is a clusterf— and I even live in CA
It’s incredibly shortsighted not to stock adequate parts. Bad ownership experiences lead to pissed off customers and less repeat business. The Tesla products are amazing but the Tesla organization needs to improve on a lot of things.
Uhhh when you buy stock someone is selling it too
"Yes, the person who sells calls is a short that expects the price to fall."
"In the first quarter they missed expectations by several thousand deliveries, this quarter they made up for that but not to the same amount that they missed in Q1. So despite being up on deliveries this Q they are still behind overall for the year... but like I said I love Tesla and glad they’ve had a good Q"
Thanks u/todu
That hasn't been true for a few years now fwiw
"There are a couple of uncomfortable paradoxes here (that is if integrity is important.)

- Why trust sources that are disseminating information that they, or their sources, have been asked to keep confidential? (If they're being dishonest to their employer, they're ipso facto untrustworthy.)

- Why publish information that steals or undermines Tesla's hard won narrative?"
"They said the batteries in the car will likely stay the same, but the efficiency of the motor and components is being continually improved."

"My dad road tripped his Chevy Bolt from Central Florida to the panhandle and it wasn't necessarily convenient but he was able to plan out charging stops. It certainly won't scale like Tesla charging stations given the problems he had and the limited options, but the idea that he has to stay at home is a distortion."
Are you all unaware that tesla outsourced their batteries from samsung until tesla violated the contract and samsung dropped them?
IPace sales are disappointing even with production being constrained. That’s why they are offering 0% financing in many markets
Jagaur’s sugar daddy pulled in 110 billion of revenue last year.
It’s not a distinct possibility at all. Jaguar is owned by Tata... not even an independent company.
Tesla is going to India within 2 years.
"Partnership == admiting you can't do it yourself when tiny, inexperienced Tesla could."
"They’re doing fine and are announcing tons of investment alongside new Hybrids and pure EVs ... 

I don’t understand how this sub can think Tesla losing money almost every quarter is fine, but JLR losing some for a couple quarters (after record sales and profit) is the death of the company"
Probably because everyone already knows Jags are garbage. It’d be more newsworthy if you had seen one that wasn’t already on fire.
"My dad was a Jag man, he loved the leather and the smooth drive. But that was old Jags, I'm not so sure they're quite the same now. Ever since the X-type which was basically a Mondeo in Jag clothes they've lacked cachet. The latest crop look a bit odd to my eye but at least they're better than the horrible S-type."

"Agreed. If Tesla goes out now, everyone will drop their electric lineup, as if they had a 100% probability of being successful but just decided not to."
This is exactly right.  If tesla goes bankrupt they’lol be making a documentary called “Who killed the electric car - again?”
"I put the source in my original comment, cheers!"
"Or maybe efficiency isn’t the king in a CAR. It’s king I’m a battery but a car is more than a battery.

MPG has never been important when judging car of the year.

"Europe, sure.. Globally? Undisputed."
"The iPace is a better size for Europe than the S and X, since it's basically the size of a VW Golf. The 3 is closer in size to the Jag, and is outselling it like crazy. I expect that the Y will do even better."
Because the iPace is absolutely tiny compared to S & X.  It fits better on small European roads.
Thank you :) I understand it now
"To follow your reasoning, Tesla also released Raven Model S which is by far the best EV/ICE ever produced, goes 370 miles per charge... I guess CNBC should include this fact in the news to explain why Tesla got record sales? Why CNBC didn't include this?

&#x200B;

Also in US Model 3's sales beat all the mid-sized premium sedans combined. Why CNBC didn't add this? isn't this more relevant to the record quarter news?

&#x200B;

Also, the new top line Model X goes 2.7s for 0-60, no other SUV gets close to that. new Model S reach 2.4s, other cars with this kind of performance are selling for million dollars.

&#x200B;

Also, Tesla fans volunteered to help with delivery, isn't this relevant info in this news? Why not mentioned?

&#x200B;

My point is, CNBC gets paid to bash Tesla. That's how the game is played."
CNBC is only antiTesla. Period.
"> Did Tesla not lose Peter Hochholdinger? 


... Yes they did.  So what?   Executives come and go at companies *all the time*.  It's literally not even news... Unless you're Tesla for some reason, then everyone loses their minds.  It's like how there's a press campaign every time a Tesla is in an accident.  Do Ford cars not get in accidents?"
"So long it's not Elon, JB, Jerome, Drew, Karpathy who cares?"
I mean Tesla was just overbought. It's stabilizing now. Stock price isn't an exact measure of success or performance.
I dig the username.
"Far left, here. I love Tesla."
"Honestly, that's the worst possible argument about this. Do you really see CNBC and other mainstream US media's as being ""far left"" or anti-capitalist in any way? If there is an agenda behind the negativity, outside of negativity sell, the only thing I could see is that Tesla is breathing in the neck of other car manufacturers which are enormous customers (to the medias) for adspace, which Tesla does little to none of."
"""CNBC is far left."" That's a hell of a take lmao."

Factset estimate was gamed. Too many of the Wall Street firms had sub 90k estimates for it to be 91k.
Where do you go to find how the average estimate was derived?
Technically accurate
OMG they delivered too many many cars!!! Their workers are overworked!!
"Agreed with everything, but if they pull the B.S. 500k quote, they will be once again misinterpreting the quote since it said by year end they will be PACING 500K production, not reaching it."
Don’t give them any ideas! Haha
"Tesla doesn't spend much money on advertising.  CNBC (and other ""news"" sources like Business Insider) depend on advertising dollars.  I'm sure oil and traditional car manufacturer ads dollars influence their negative biases."
"Man, I love my worthless stock I bought at $183. Such sad."
"Bought a bunch of shares when it hit 300 for a while. Increased shares by 50% when it hit 180. Atleast I might break even soon haha. If it hits 330 again this year, might make all the price drops a little easier to swallow."
"I wonder at what point they will reach a range where everyone accepts as a standard? Maybe 500? I’m sure they can keep achieving more and more, but offering a battery that can go 1,000 miles isn’t necessary for the vast majority of people and is a waste of materials that could be potentially used to make two shorter range cars. I think developing faster charging is much more important."
"Lol that’s great. Cars that go 80 miles on a charge, put out 100hp and have no charging network are “increased competition.”"
>This is perfect!
"Yep and I wouldn’t want one lol. I feel like if you really like Jaguar and wouldn’t mind trying an electric car, you’re probably the customer for them.  If you want an electric and the best one, you will gravitate to Tesla.  They’re the leader"

Not in the EU. Not at all. Check the numbers."
"Yah, but how thin was that margin.  Bet its too thin to take 110 billion of revenue for an ICE platform and convert it to a BEV platform.  LOL.  It's easer for Tesla to become a big boy than it is for the big boys to become Tesla."
"Jagaur will have a hard time to survive in the next few years. Their ICE cars can't compete with EVs, their EVs can't compete with Tesla. It's as simple as that."
In a conversation about Tata this had a wholly different meaning to me
"Let's not shit on the big boys finally bitting the bullet and entering the EV market, shall we? That's what Tesla *wants*."
"That’s factually false. Partnership == share R&D cost so the program is more profitable.

Look at the Toyota Supra and the BMW Z4, it’s a very close partnership project, but saying each company isn’t capable of building their own sports car is just plain ridiculous.

It’s more or less BMW and Jaguar looked at Tesla’s cash burn for 10 years and then looked at each other and went “yo.. lets get more of that EV market share and not burn as much money as Tesla did...”"
"I mean, I-Pace and the BMW i range both exist, so it's not like they've got no idea what they're doing."
"There’s a lot to be said for the economies of scale and being part of a larger group.

Tesla are hardly the last bastion of profitability now are they."
"JLR castle Bromwich has stopped producing on Fridays, the company has laid off thousands of contract workers. They're definitely struggling while they refresh the line."
"Erm ok ? Profit was made the quarter after.

Also that “loss” is a write down in the value of some of its investments. It’s had no influence on all the positive cash flow they have"
"Damn, I’m closer to 300 on my performance model 3."
"Telsa funded the entirety of Model S ramp on $105 million privately raised capital, with nothing to start with. No machinery. No established suppliers. No distribution network. No advertising.

Ford's $500 million can go a long way if spent even half as efficiently as Telsa's capital. And that's ignoring the $700 million Amazon investment. And that's *just their 2019 investment raises*. They raised more than $450 million in capital and debt financing by the end of 2018.

Personally, I'm hoping Rivian knocks it out of the park. I'd love for the top two EV manufacturers in the world to be US startup success stories."
"I mean probably not considering Rivian already has the Skateboard developed it looks like which is what Ford is going to use to build an EV off of. I mean obviously it'd take a lot more money, but just saying, it's not a small amount..."
"I just hope Tesla crushes them all. 
I don’t have Ford stock, I do have Tesla.."
"Ford or Jag? Ford doesn’t currently have anything but they invested a decent amount in rivian, have almost if not promised a hybrid mustang, and say a hybrid or electric (or both) f150 is coming.  I don’t know about jag but I haven’t even heard of any rumors of anything."
">  everyone will drop their electric lineup

No they won't. There are standards in the whole of EU that require EVs or a shit ton of hybrids as part of the fleet to avoid billion dollar fines."
"Efficiency is most certainly king in EVs right now. All I ever hear about is range anxiety and lack of charging accessibility. Highly efficient vehicles get better range so they need to worry about it less.


Automotive journalists objectively love to shit on Tesla. You could have strapped them in a hot turd with a battery and a motor and they would have reviewed it well as long as it didn't have a Tesla logo."
"No, efficiency isn’t king in a car. It’s king in an EV. If you owned one, you would know this. Greater efficiency means more range, but it also means faster charging. The Achilles heel of an EV is it’s range and it’s ability to charge (when compared to an ICE). Tesla has solved this. Jaguar hasn’t. The journalists don’t realise this yet."
"Not dwarfed though. Europe is a very important market. And they compete in the same price range in Europe.

If you look at May, the iPace sells more than the X if you sum EU+US sales"
"The iPace, very similar to the Model 3 in dimensions, is absolutely not the size of a Golf. Two completely different classes.

The 3 is closer in size to the Jag, but the Jag costs 30k more, so it doesn't make sense to compare the sales that way. Of course a cheaper SUV sells more than Audi, for example.

Also, OP's point was ""the ipace is being dwarfed by the X"", which is not the case in Europe. At all."
"Ok, but op said ""I-Pace is being dwarfed by the X"", and that's not true at all in Europe, it's the other way around."
You know Tesla is an awesome company when it has every odd stacked against it and it still smashes it out of the park. Tesla is more valuable as a company to humanity than any other company I can think of.

Because it hasn’t been on the market all quarter and thus had next to zero impact on deliveries. It’s also not a new model, just a drivetrain refresh, so it’s really not relevant to this story.

>	Also in US Model 3’s sales beat all the mid-sized premium sedans combined. Why CNBC didn’t add this? isn’t this more relevant to the record quarter news?

Not really, because it’s not news and it isn’t relevant to Tesla’s success. The question isn’t about the demand for Tesla’s product, it’s about whether Tesla can deliver the product in the quantity it needs to, with the margins it needs to. Tesla’s competitors in that segment are not losing money like Tesla is.

>	Also, the new top line Model X goes 2.7s for 0-60, no other SUV gets close to that. new Model S reach 2.4s, other cars with this kind of performance are selling for million dollars.

The Turbo S doesn’t cost a million dollars. It costs $170k and is a better performance car in every way, while being more reliable and more luxurious. The Model S has plenty of things going for it – the mixture of performance and practicality is unbeaten. You don’t have to exaggerate.

>	Also, Tesla fans volunteered to help with delivery, isn’t this relevant info in this news? Why not mentioned?

You probably should be happy they didn’t mention that.

>	My point is, CNBC gets paid to bash Tesla. That’s how the game is played.

Ok, let’s see some evidence for that."
Except for the whole title and the whole rest of the article.
"A company the size of Tesla relies on a lot more people than just its high-profile management. Departures like this can be symptomatic of problematic politics/work relationships, questions about the long-term stability of the company, ethical concerns, you name it. All of which can easily cause a company greater headache than the departure of a big name.

It can also be that the guy’s looking for more money, which isn’t necessarily evidence of structural problems at Tesla. Maybe he wants a change of scenery or more time off, again not necessarily something Tesla should be worried about."
Right. To be fair though there aren’t many measures of success or performance that work better.
I wonder how many of us there are
"I'm arguing that many of their writers probably are. they would never let that side show toward a company that buys ad space, but Tesla doesn't do that, so they can let their personal feelings fly"
"Eh.  I'm a leftie, but he's right about a lot of the left hating Elon."
"I am friends with a lot of grad students at a major university. when I go to a party, there are typically about 20% full-on Marxists who deny the Ukrainian and great leap famines, and 100% burnie support. those with aspirations of writing for news papers and  media outlets tend to be the full-on Marxists.they talk about this with a totally straight face, and see no flaws in it:

I don't think people realize how popular Marxism is in certain circles."
cheers mate. it's no worries either way. I know how people get.
Justin just brought in a 5000 dollar rebate for EV's....
"Exactly this.  They were trying to set up Tesla for a miss, and Tesla still beat them."
"""Tesla below estimates by -25000!"""
And he also said 500k by this time next year which is from May. Only need to average about 15% QoQ which china should easily handle in Q1 2020 once the cheaper SR+ models are available from GF3
"That is my belief too.  Telsa spend ZERO cents on the old style media.

&#x200B;

Newspapers, Magazines, TV Ads, News channels - not a cent!

That must piss they off."
"Yep Mercedes, Ford, and Shell are major CNBC advertisers."
"Just like anything else, some vehicles will get cheaper and some will get longer range"
"Highways speeds bro. At 75mph, a Tesla X is running at 430wh/mi at those speeds. A 290mi X can barely go 230 miles at highway speeds. If it had a ""500 mile"" battery, the realistic distance is more like 400 miles which is literally LA to Phoenix. That would make supercharging stops much less desperate and more deliberate."
[deleted]
I think they will continue to push the range until it gets to the max you can travel in one day.  The barrier to some people buying electric vehicles is that you can’t just fill them back up and keep going.
"In Australia we encourage drivers to stop frequently to avoid fatigue related crashes.  This website includes the oft repeated guide of 15 minutes every two hours:  https://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/Safety/Driver-guide/Driving-safely/Driving-tired.aspx

We set up “driver reviver” caravans with free tea, coffee and biscuits to encourage people to “stop, revive, survive”.

Multiple drivers with frequent swaps aside, and ignoring any benefits of highway autopilot on driver fatigue, we have a “safe” range of 150 miles at 75 mph (average).  The driver has to stop for 15 mins, so stop at a charger.  A 300 mike battery can run 20% to 70% charged nicely.

I’ve driven and even ridden well beyond these guidelines, but it is reasonable to suggest I was being reckless and unsafe, especially towards the end as we get into “make this end” mode and push on.

My point being a car that makes you stop every two hours for a 15 minute battery charge may well save your life by avoiding a micro sleep related crash....

FSD then eliminates this constraint.

Next, what about modular batteries?  I drive less than 5 miles a day on weekdays, and less than 20 miles on weekends.  Occasionally I will do 300 miles in a weekend.   An electric car to suit would drag around a big heavy battery every day to suit that one in 90 day event.  Would be cool to take 50% of my battery out of my car (like removing a laptop battery), and plug it into my powerwall until I need it in my car...."
"600, that's the cap, they do that. They win."
"At some point they can make the batteries smaller to gain more efficiency, without having to sacrifice much range."
"Most definitely. people will get used to 15 minute top ups without any issues road trips are about the only issue. No one has more than 200 km daily drives regularly, only about once every month or year. That's about it. If they can install the 250kw superchargers on all major highways, I think range anxiety won't exist even on road trips. Even 30 kwatthour batteries are sufficient for most people outside the us. It's only the sparsely populated us that has people travelling from suburbs 100 km away. For us I think 60 kwatthours will be standard, as is evident in the model 3 already. Batteries will improve at about 30 percent every 5 years according to Elons estimate, so electric is already sorted. Just infrastructure is required, for superchargers like petrol pumps,only difference being petrol pumps(gas station?) had time to grow with the vehicle density. This will have to be more forceful. Besides this forceful push,, and maybe fighting the oil lobby, electric will easily win(become only way) in the next decade."
"> I wonder at what point they will reach a range where everyone accepts as a standard? Maybe 500?

I think 500 miles is a significant milestone for it's then matching ICE cars. That is, taking this semi random ICE car as the standard
> All 2019 Toyota RAV4 models are outfitted with a 14.5-gallon fuel tank. This means that FWD models can cover an estimated 377 city miles or 507.5 highway miles. AWD models can cover approximately 362.5 city miles or 478.5 highway miles.
https://www.allannotttoyota.com/blog/fuel-economy-and-driving-range-of-the-2019-toyota-rav4/"
I think that’s exactly it with the faster supercharging
"I dont thing there will ever be such a point. Range is for EVs what horsepower is for ICE vehicles. Bragging point number one, by a wide wide margin."
"The main impediment to EV sales is price, not range. As people become more familiar with EVs and charging networks improve I think range anxiety will decrease. For many people a 200 mile range will suffice for the majority of their trips and fast chargers can make their longer journeys possible.

So in the future I expect that a real world 200 mile range will become standard but with EV decreasing greatly in price. Of course some will want a larger range but they can pay for the upgrade.

Car manufacturers would also prefer to keep battery range down as batteries are the limiting factor to EV production. Only the luxury segment will have a 400+ mile range as standard for the foreseeable future."
"It's almost more just about rolling out more chargers.

At least here in the UK, the thing I find most limiting is that stops have to be in the same places every time.  The time doesn't matter per se (that's largely because I have small children so short stops are not really a thing), but going to the same handful of places time after time is dull."
"450 real world range would be great, but you definitely need some buffer on top for range loss over time. I don’t see a real need for range higher than that. But price, raw materials, and weight makes this a complex problem. You want to have enough raw materials to satisfy the vehicle demand, eg. making as many batteries from as little material as possible.

 Increasing the amount of batteries also increases weight, which means the body, suspension and brakes needs to be beefier, which in turn increases the price in addition to the price increase caused by the extra batteries."
"You say 1000 miles isn’t necessary for “the vast majority of people”, but that’s assuming “the vast majority of people” don’t go on road trips where they drive several hundred miles per day at 75-80 mph (which isn’t the most efficient speed). It’s not needed for the vast majority of *days* but I would say that the vast majority of *drivers* do in fact utilize the capability of their car to travel great distances in one day without having to alter course for chargers"
Well... an increase from 0 to 1 is still an increase
Dont forget no autopilot or over the air updates
"Well, they're not wrong, but to quote Robert Mcnomera... https://youtu.be/HNrAPQEILbg?t=23

Zero times two is still zero."
"Well as an anecdotal example, in Melbourne, I have seen exactly one iPace, and it was on the back of a truck, about 3 months ago. I see at least 10-20 Teslas everyday. If I’ve only seen one car in a city of 5 million people (bearing in mind that everyday I’ll see multiple exotics like Ferrari Pistas, Mclarens and countless Bentleys), then demand here at least certainly is an issue. But I guess the $150k they want for the Jag here is big money for a car that looks like a lifted and bloated Golf."
"Jaguar sells every iPace they make, but they don't have the battery supply they need."
I'm guessing at home or on relatively unreliable L2 public chargers.
"I don’t get the notion that it’s good looking. To me it just looks like a regular European hatchback. It’s a little bigger, but it’s certainly not a real SUV. The closest car in terms of looks and size appears to be the Mitsubishi ASX. No one ever said that car was good looking."
If they were selling all they can make they’d not offer 0% interest. That’s a demand lever that costs Jaguar 3-5% a year of the total car price.
"Ok, how many have they sold in the last quarter? 95,000? 17,000 (to match X + S)?"
"I’m not talking about Jaguar, I’m talking about Tata, their parent company.

As long as Jaguar keeps Tata happy, they have free reign to lose or make as much money as they want."
"In the US maybe, e-Tron and I-Pace are separately outselling the S and X combined in EU markets like Norway over 2019."
... that's exactly what they got. No idea ... Those drivetrains can be designed by a team from a University. They have nothing special.
"The line is being retooled for EVs. It’s essential work that needs to be done. Of course you’d lay-off contractors while they can’t actually do any work ...

Also the Friday is only a half day which they intend to make up for during the rest of the week.

Has this even been put into motion or are you just following the media speculation because I personally haven’t heard anything beyond initial suspicions"
"The point is the press keeps banging on about Tesla losing money and going bankrupt (or bankwupt as Elon put it) and everyone runs with it. I've had plenty of people tell me that I'm mad for buying a Tesla because they're going bankrupt. No-one thinks JLR are going bankrupt but their news is actually very similar to the ups and downs that Tesla has but the press doesn't blast it all over the place. That, and calling the i-Pace a Tesla killer which it clearly isn't. The press is in love with killing Tesla for some reason.

Don't take things so seriously next time huh?"
I can get to \~280 if I do tons of hard accelerations and drive in high speed. I normally drive in chill mode.
R&D spending is more than producing a few concept vehicles. engineering the manufacturing process costs 100x more than the cost of a few prototypes.
"That's swell and all, but remember Elon saying that the hardest problem he ever worked on was designing the machine that builds the machine? I.e. the production tools and lines."
"I hope every carmaker transitions very quickly to EV, regardless of brand."
"I have both (sometimes I ask myself - how did that happen?). I hope they both do ok, the cyberpunk truck unveil will be interesting to watch!"
"I think Tesla's pickup truck and Model Y will drive Rivian to bankruptcy. I could be wrong, we can watch this one unfold. I'm not concerned about Ford's own EV or hybrid development, they are not capable to compete."
And existing legacy automakers are doing the bare minimum to meet these standards. They know the profit-maximizing move in the near-term is to squeeze as much value as possible from exisitinf ICE platforms.
"OK, then lets rework it to:

> everyone will drop their serious focus on EVs and make shitloads of compliance cars no one wants."
Heard of the diesel scandal? They’ll cheat and swindle their way to sustained profits as long as possible
"I don’t think it’s the range people are concerned with, it’s the lack of charging infrastructure, and charging time.

My ICE car has a max range of like 600, but I never fill it over half and actually however around 170 - 250 of estimated range.

I never feel this is an issue cause I know I can fill it up anywhere at anytime and it’ll take me 5 minutes:

The Model 3 charges insanely fast, so as soon as we get more fast charges (or charges in general) most peoples fears should be addressed.

We did some market research which shown that most peoples issue was that they didn’t actually know how many charge points were already available, many didn’t think there were any local to them"
An EV is a car ... Like it or not. It’s already been noted that people don’t NEED all that range and actually consider other things when picking a car
"Tesla hasn’t solved charging, it’s better but not solved"
">The question isn’t about the demand for Tesla’s product, it’s about whether Tesla can deliver the product in the quantity it needs to,

The only thing I heard about at the beginning of this quarter was Tesla's demand problem. This is literally what we mean when we say the goalposts are constantly shifting.

It should absolutely be apart of the story, but now that the ""demand problem"" is gone there's no need to mention it."
" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNQluK5rQEw&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNQluK5rQEw&feature=youtu.be)   
Cutting to the chase 3:13. Who talks to their guest like that? The host is literally saying ""There is no service"". Like really?? Tesla service is not the best I totally agree, but ""there is no service"" is just pathetic on your face fuck you. Who even talks like this?  


I understand skepticism. Tesla frequently claims to achieve lofty goals, misses and gets criticism. But the lack of objectivity gets me. No one can deny that Tesla has achieved a lot of important things. Tesla bull analysts deserve some respect."
"> Ok, let’s see some evidence for that.

You can't even try to argue that here.  People believe they don't need evidence when they have instinct."
Everyone has only talked about Tesla demand this year so that point is mute.
170k? How is that comparable?
">Not really, because it’s not news and it isn’t relevant to Tesla’s success. The question isn’t about the demand for Tesla’s product 

The article disagrees:

>A disappointing 63,000 vehicles were delivered during the first three months of the year, when Tesla was plagued by challenges transporting cars from its factory in Fremont, California, across the world as well as **questions about waning customer demand**. 

Personal commentary: The question of customer demand is the most important thing with Tesla right now. Roughly speaking, they can break even or be slightly profitable with the units they were selling in Q3 and Q4. If they could sustain that level of demand they'd be in the clear, if not super profitable. Improving margins could make them healthier still. For more than a year, some very vocal concerns have been related to demand dropping for one reason or another:

* Demand will drop when Tesla works through all the preorders
* Demand will drop when tax incentives are reduced
* Demand will drop when competitors come out with their own EVs
* Demand has already dropped in the US as evidenced by price drops, Standard Range model and non-American deliveries

I'm not super concerned about these things myself, but others have been enough that demand concerns got a mention in the article."
Yikes. It's crazy when you say anything negative about Tesla here.
I like your username and you make good points
The article only exists for them to crap on them at the end. If you have been watching them at all for the past few years you would really how disgusting they are. They aren't journalist. They're scum.
Give this bullshit up
"In 85' GM restructured and layed off 800 vp's. Even for a company GN size that's a lot. They came out with better products, more revenue, higher profit.

It's not always bad when people leave. That said most of these vps are taking higher positions at other companies.  People leaving is not a story unless it's followed by why. Because people leave for many reasons and not all of them bad, especially at that level."
Puts hand up!
"OMG I'm still laughing...stop, seriously, stop!"
Which is hilarious considering nbc and its corporate sponsors continue to lobby and shill for corporations. I guess if you “care” about social issues that makes it a “left” channel when in fact its just an arm for corporate democrats... Can’t wait for the day government regulation goes for those corporate shitters.
">those with aspirations of writing for news papers and media outlets tend to be the full-on Marxists

Yeah full-on Marxists dream of cranking out quarterly review articles for CNBC."
"My man, you need to get onto SNL. This shit is priceless!"
this is adorable
ugh
You also get faster charging with larger batteries. So it reduces your charge duration too.
"I can get 400+ miles in my pickup truck and gas up anywhere, I hope Tesla pushes the ranges out beyond 500 miles with faster charging."
"For me , as a sales rep, I have to be able to do back and forth between Montréal and Québec City in the middle of winter. That's around 500km at -10 or -20 celcius.

If I can charge my batteries to full in 15-20mins in a supercharger in between, that also works.

Other than that... I don't usually do more than 120km in a day."
"Unfortunately with the heat on full blast (maybe not necessary but definitely a thing people do in their ice car) the range is complete garbage, im gonna hold out until i can go for about 6 hours of driving at highway speed with the heat on and still have ~50 miles left (i take that kind of trip 2-3x per month, to a bunch of national parks)"
But you can
"This. I feel like some people don’t understand how important roadtripping is to typical lower to middle class American families. 70%+ of American families can not afford to fly on their vacations, and most of them get AT BEST a week for vacation. That means, if they’re lucky, 2 weekends and the 5 days between. If those people can’t drive 700-850 miles per day, most of them simply can’t go on the vacations they want to without spending more than half the vacation just in transit.

When I was a kid, I wouldn’t have been able to do one-(long) day trips from Chicago to Wichita, KS.

I wouldn’t have been able to one-shot Columbus, OH to Norman, OK for a college visit in mid July 2013 if we couldn’t drive 14 hours without stopping for multiple hours to charge somewhere.

Flying was not an option in either case, and I wouldn’t have been able to see all of my family members in Kansas if we’d had to take more days for driving because we had to stop and charge.

We need to, IMO, develop a battery that’s good for 1100 miles at 75 mph in one single shot, in any conditions regardless of hot or cold. It has to be not only equivalent, but BETTER compared to a gas car that you have to refill every 250-500 miles"
"Now this is the first time of hearing about this idea. It sounds great actually. Also, for longer trips, just grab a 2nd battery you have fully charged and throw it in the frunk. When close to low, just swap an and keep going."
[deleted]
"Ohhhh c'mon I did California and bit of Nevada / Arizona trip (comming from Europe) with Ford Fusion hybrid and real world range was about 400-420 miles for me. For 2700 miles I've driven actually only once needed to refill during trip between staying somewhere at night and it was near Area 51 when comming from Williams Arizona through Las Vegas and empty desert after passing it. It was more precocius even there (and I've checked - even there I would be able to supercharge). 400 miles is really enough, but OK make it 500 EPA to make up for winter loss of range, get more V3 on highways and range anxiety is non-existent for 99,99% of population (at least in USA)."
And you're carrying that 1000 miles worth of battery around the 98% of time you aren't road tripping
Infinite increase!
Lol same. I’m in Chicago and we have a healthy Tesla population and I frequently see BMW i3 and 8. Don’t think I’ve ever seen the ipace
"I went to my local Jag dealership for a drive of an iPace.

Jag: Nope, sorry, not charged.

Me: Ok, Tuesday?  

Jag: call back Thursday.

And then, after a few similar rounds... Sold the car.  I'm in the UK."
"I’ve seen one in Phoenix on business, none in my hometown, I bet Jaguar will kill Tesla probably next week though"
"They’re factually selling over budget. Factually they sell more than they can make.

Please don’t argue with me on this. I sit through meetings about it every month.

They’re offering that in markets where Tesla is strong in an attempt to steal sales, but they’re still selling all the cars they can just not in Tesla regions"
"0% financing is an incentive, but an extremely common one. Not sure how much I'd read into that."
You know those are global numbers though
"Wouldnt losing money be the thing that makes Tata unhappy ? Sorry if I'm missing something, I'm fairly ignorant on the subject."
"It's a similar situation like in China, just watch next year, Tesla will give a hard time to all the 400+ EV companies in China. Most of them will bankrupt in a few years.
Wait for the Gigafactory in EU, which will eliminate tariff and most of shipping cost. Watch what EU produced Model 3 and Model Y will do."

"I’ve never claimed Tesla we’re going out of business ... 

You’ve just linked me to the press blasting JLR all over the place and this sub has people saying JLR are going bankrupts so errr I don’t get how Tesla are the only victims here.

The difference is Tesla and owners by another company that make billions, who themselves aren’t part owned by another juggernaut that make hundreds of billions.

Tesla stand alone, so them losing money is more significant than JLR who as I said are seeing records sales and records profits up until the slump in China

China being the only region(very significant one though) where JLR aren’t recording record sales"
"If you think Ford is AT ALL worried about the manufacturing process, you are 100% trippin. They absolutely are behind on EV's and Software as are ALL of the traditional big automakers, but lets not forget that Ford sells almost 2x as many F-150's per year as Tesla has sold in it's entire history. Literally the only thing they'd at all be worried about is Battery Supply, which is obviously the big thing Tesla has on the competition with soon to be 2 Gigafactories producing battery packs. But it's not like Panasonic and LG, and whoever else are just sitting on their hands, they are building new factories as well. 

You can underestimate Rivian if you want, but I'm not going to, and the fact that they got $700M from Amazon, and $500M from Ford is pretty big. Their investment in Rivian imo is going to give them a significant running start.

Point is Fords $500M investment in Rivian is not pennies imo. I think it's actually going to work really well for them."
"yeah i think this is the biggest issue people miss out.  musk used to say, ""we're building the machine that builds the machine"".  while ford may not have to build an entire pick up truck factory from scratch, their longevity in this line of business shouldn't be scoffed at.  half a billion would probably get it done."
"Yeah that is because Elon didn't have a background in manufacturing, he had a background in software. And Tesla absolutely refused to hire people with actual automotive manufacturing experience (unlike Rivian)....this is both a good thing and a bad thing. They do things no other auto company will do because of it, but they also fail at some very basic stuff that other auto companies have been doing for decades...

Ford, GM, Toyota and the like won't have problem with the actual manufacturing of these vehicles. That will be by far the easiest part for them. The only advantage Tesla has over the competition when it comes to manufacturing is that they produce their own Batteries. And that absolutely is a MAJOR advantage. And they are very vertically integrated which is extremely helpful for costs and overall product integration. There really isn't much special about the process Tesla manufactures things that puts them above any of the traditional automakers in that regard. In fact strictly manufacturing speaking, Tesla is probably one of the worst. BUT their design and tech is just so much better than the competition...

Put it this way if Tesla were to completely design these vehicles and do all the software and cell production, then handed it off to Ford or whoever, The Model 3 production would be a year ahead of where it is today (If it wasn't limited by battery cells that is).....and funny enough, that's sorta what Ford is trying to do with their $500M investment in Rivian!"
"I think it’s an issue that they won’t have a supercharging network, but I don’t think the model Y is a competitor for rivians SUV. I haven’t seen any confirmed facts about the Tesla pickup so I can’t speculate on that. The model Y is a slightly larger model 3, the rivian suv can tow more than a class 1 pickup. The rivian suv will also be vastly more capable on rough roads and off road with a confirmed fording depth of almost 3 feet. I know off roading is a small percentage of the market, but as an off road enthusiasts it is important to me. I think rivian will be able to survive on selling their skateboard tech and would probably get absorbed by a legacy automaker like ford before they go out of business. Why do you say that ford isn’t capable to compete? Genuinely curious as I think Ford is capable of building a 250 mile range f150. I think a hybrid with 50-60 miles of electric only would be good enough for me."
"Okay but no one will drop their electric lineup since they still have to produce those EVs, and more EVs each year.

Not producing an EV that actually sells means fines. That's why we're seeing a huge boom of models in EU, even Fiat released a EV Ducato (Fiat is paying Tesla 600 millions to have their credits)"
"But if they don't sell them, they're fucked. They have to sell enough EVs to offset the ICEs they sell in Europe, or have a large part of their cars as hybrids (Toyota went this route for next year targets, but will have to switch anyways for the coming years). Similar to California, for example."
There's simply no way to cheat around those fines though. They require EVs.
"Lol, ok. Tell that to the Nissan Leaf owners. Keep up that winning attitude JLR."
With V3 chargers the model 3 can add 50% in 7 minutes. That’s almost the entire range of an iPace in 7 minutes.
"The demand problem certainly exists for the Model S and Model X, though not the Model 3."
"It’s not, it’s just not anywhere close to a million dollars. Check out what I was responding to. And a lot of people who are looking at a Model S for its performance will be interested in cars that cost even more than a Turbo S."
"Try saying something accurate, to the point, or even true. Problem solved"
Yup. I have to say it though.
They've proven their journalistic integrity time and again with coverage written to try and protect the industries Tesla is disrupting. Saw more of the same with their pointed lack of airtime for Yang in the first debate. It's quite clear MSNBC has a master to serve. They've lost all credibility.
Such a horrible article that Elon Musk retweeted it.
"I realize you like Tesla a lot and are frustrated by the reporting that’s coming from the financial news peanut gallery. But recognize that you are a bit biased yourself. Tesla’s fundamentals do not make it easy for financial analysts to write glowing reports on the company. They’ve had one big earnings beat in as long as I can remember, and the rest have been pretty serious misses. Tesla has debt concerns that everyone knows about. They have talent acquisition and retention issues that everyone knows about. And the manufacturing/servicing issues aren’t doing any favors for their previously gilded brand image. Tesla’s in a tough spot right now and it’s not wrong of people to point it out."
not a lot of good paying jobs at Marxist media outlets.
"I went 22,000 miles on $700. What'd filling your 34 gallon tank set you back? $80-$100 a pop at the gas station? There's a whole lot more to owning a Tesla than the range limitations. Plus, driving a Tesla is more enjoyable than driving any other car."
Don't u find the superchargers really slow during the winter?   In Toronto I found they were always capped to 60kwh or below for the most part even when the SC was empty.   My car was warm upon approach too.
Can you do that in a gas car? At 75MPH that would be over 500 miles
"When you drive a lot, having the autopilot on for most of the trip more than makes up for having to stop a little more frequently.  Charging being 25-50% the cost of gas also helps the trips to be less stressful/more enjoyable."
"And in the meanwhile, you’ll definitely be missing out by owning one of the best cars on the planet."
Okay
"European here, you people ever heard of trains?"
"1100 miles in a single shot........sorry but that is not only a crazy demand but also dangerous because a single shot drive is only important if you don’t rest.
When you drive long hauls you need bathroom breaks, lunch/dinner breaks, rest breaks and do you know what your tesla can do in that time: supercharge a couple of 100’s miles of range."
"for most people, a daily driver that goes 50 miles a day is fine most of the time, then for the twice a year longer road trip they could rent a longer range vehicle, while putting their daily driver into the rental pool during the trip. my current daily driver is a $1k van that i don't trust for long road trips, so if had to do a road trip i'd think about renting something economical or taking megabus. i don't need a $100k model s to go to the grocery store. my sister's electric car is a used leaf with a short range, but she lives in hawaii so no long road trips anyway."
"> When I was a kid, I wouldn’t have been able to do one-(long) day trips from Chicago to Wichita, KS.

No one is going to believe you drove this there and back in a single day and had any time to do anything while there.  You are making shit up.

Now if you are actually trying to say you need to drive to wichita within a day, a tesla does that just fine.

A regular car is 11.75 hours(add one hour to google time for stops) and a tesla is 13.5hrs using v2 superchargers.  v3 supercharging would be 12.5 hrs.  We are talking a 45min difference as they ramp up v3 superchargers.  That difference is 100% because the ICE can take a slightly shorter route.  v3 supercharging would be equal to ICE if they did the same routes."
And how much extra would you be willing to pay for such a vehicle?  10%?  20%?  30%?  Since it's going twice as far on a single charge it might be 50% more.  Most people won't pay that much extra because they literally would never use the capability.  In semiconductor testing we call that a corner case.
"That concept has quite a number of challenges.  

It works well for barbecue gas bottles because they are typically returned to the point of sale and the equipment to fill them is specialised and hence can be cost effectively centralised.

Car batteries will travel and so you’ll get drift, so you need  trucks driving around to normalise the distribution: much like what’s needed for the bicycle and scooter hire companies.

Also a battery can have quite varied quality and thus range depending on what sort of service life it has had.  I guess that can be factored into the design of the battery itself and the charging mechanism so that people who abuse batteries pay more.  The battery exchange process will be complicated by choosing a battery of sufficient range.  I guess you can discount batteries with less range and charge a premium for fully charged and high range batteries.

It would suck to turn up to a swap station Only to find all the batteries there were low quality and hence you need to stop again or you cannot make your destination.

Another impediment to Modula batteries and battery swap technology is the complexity of the design.  iPhone did away with it for a reason.  The phone form factor is more highly impacted but safety considerations and ease of Manufacturing may well rule out modular designs.

Lastly charging infrastructure is going to be a lot simpler than battery swap infrastructure.

Another way to look at it is the cost of that big battery relative to just hiring a suitable car once every few months.

In a year none of us will own our cars and will just use Elon’s Uber service anyway right?"
I’ve seen just one in the Bay Area so far.
I've seen one  - on the internet.
I've seen one in NYC. That's it.
"Phoenix/Scottsdale here. 1 ipace spotted on one day - dozens of Teslas daily here. I have 70 mile round trip commute so some time to sample. Next would be leafs, with smattering of darth Vader helmet cars -I swear that i3 from the back...."
I wonder if they are anti selling? I know the Australian dealers did that with the Nissan Leaf because they had no margin and with no servicing on electric cars a big revenue stream is gone. Not that Jaguar won’t charge you a fortune for servicing anyway.
"That’s funny, because I sit in meetings which say the opposite, every two weeks. So please don’t argue with me.  

I mean, if you’re going to give some bullshit reason without backing it up, you probably want to know how to use the term budget properly."
"Would depend on Tata’s goals with Jaguar.

If they want Jaguar to be a self sustaining company sure, it would be an issue. 

If they want Jaguar to be a loss-leader and pave the way for other profitable brands under Tata, then no.

Bugatti lost 6 million on every Veyron, didn’t make one lick of difference to the Volkswagen Group who’s intention was to swing a 16 cylinder dick around and set some records with it."
"China is cutting EV incentives in favour of FCEV’s from 2020 onwards, I absolutely expect most to be hit very hard."
"That’s about the layoffs awhile back not about Castle Broms EV expansions.

Tesla laid off a similar amount didn’t they ?

I know they’re all track workers,intact production was largely protected from those layoffs, it was mostly Finance and administrative workers that sadly got the bullet"
"The point is, I was somewhat facetious when I said they were going bankrupt because that's what always gets said about Tesla. There's been plenty of bad news about JLR over the years and they've bounced between various owners because the brand makes low volume expensive cars. Without Tata to prop them up they would be bankrupt but that's true of many car companies. Tesla has a lot of money but the press still makes out like they're going to run out of cash. They make more money on their EVs than anyone else does, but the press still says they're not profitable. They make a profit and the press lambasts them for not making enough. They know they've got a loss coming and say so, and the press attacks them and drives the share price down because they're not making a profit. They then say they're working to sell more cars than ever, and the press claims they'll never hit mark 'x' that Tesla never said they would, but then Tesla overshoots that mark and the press attacks them again.

I don't see these kinds of attacks against JLR, even though they just dumped 4500 workers (a huge amount in Brexit Britain) yet Tesla loses a few execs and the press loses their minds. Double standards. The car industry is a mess and they're in for worse to come but the press are only following their own source of revenue and Tesla doesn't advertise so the press attacks them because Tesla is successful without them and that's horrifying."
"> Point is Fords $500M investment in Rivian is not pennies imo. I think it's actually going to work really well for them

Hopefully. They might end up like BMW though, who dumped about that much into standing up i3 production, and then had to drop an additional 100 million euros to get the defect rate down from an initial rate of around 50%...

I get the feeling that being an ICE manufacturer doesn't get you as much of a leg up going through ""production hell"" ramp-up as the CNBCs imply..."
"Tesla made some huge missteps with initial model three production. However do not count them out. Automated production is very much a software problem, I’m sure Tesla learned a lot of lessons, has created a lot of new innovations and will be implementing many of those in the Shanghai Gigafactory."
"I watched how Tesla did everything in the past 16 years. EV is really easy. But designing and building great EV in scale is really hard. As far as I can see, Ford is way too behind, they don't have the capability nor the time to compete with Tesla. 

Tesla spent 16 years developing battery chemistry, battery pack, motor, motor control, towing gears, EV design, UI, autopilot, AI, automated EV manufacturing facility... All those tech can now be used toward the new pickup truck. Ford has to start from scratch, it will take them 10~15 years to get to where Tesla is, but then Tesla will have the FSD Tesla Network running in large scale. Ford is out.

Rivian will find it out in a hard way. If they can't get to large scale, they will lose tons of money. If there were no Tesla, then Rivian would have a small chance.

The problem for hybrid EV is that they don't have enough power on batteries, the pack and the motors are too small. For this reason Toyota's hybrid Sedan will be obsolete too.

Tesla's battery cost is going down, capacity is going up. That's my guess. We will find out in their Battery day for investors."
"So in otherwords, the fines have escalated to the point where the profit loss per vehicle to meet the emission standards is less than the fine.

Also, I don’t doubt that’s the case for Fiat, but timing seems to lineup nicely with Marchionne’s unfortunate passing. 

No doubt the EVs are coming from these automakers, but they sure are resisting, probably because a lot of them were hoping their suppliers would take on the massive risk of developing battery supply chains and electric drive trains"
"Have you heard about lobbying? A thing that Germany is well accustomed. If Tesla goes under, the legacy will say that it's impossible to build EVs. See WLTP and RDE."
"I won’t judge someone for enjoying their car for reasons other than range, sorry mate"
Only if you like arriving at a supercharger with 2% to spare. I personally prefer at least 20% to account for unforeseen circumstances.
Yes but not compared to an ICE
Try saying something worthwhile and not obviously false
"Nothing to do with me. 

This isn't even about this article. It's about a clear as day orchestrated agenda of a corupt company called CNBC to bring down a company trying to benifit society called Tesla. 

Tesla doesn't have those problems. CNBC wants everyone to think they do. 

Tell me Business Insider isn't specifically out to get Tesla too. I could really use a laugh."
Different people living in different locations have different priorities. Tesla is working towards accommodating all of them but as it stands it's still not much of a rural car.
"Don't get me wrong, I intend to buy a Tesla and I'm on board with BEV, but long trips are still where BEV comes up short."
">There's a whole lot more to owning a Tesla than the range limitations.

Yes there is, I can....hmmm....let's..see here $100k for an S or X  minus $3k for my truck equals $97k. Subtract another $7k to completely rebuild my truck's mechanicals, that's $90k. $90k divided by $5 per gallon gas(I actually pay around $2.60) equals 18k gallons. My truck gets 15 mpg (V8) so that's 18k gallons times 15 miles equals 270k miles I drive ~20k miles a year so divide 270k by 20k and you get 13.5 years of driving before I get to the initial cost of the Tesla, and that's weighting it in favor of the Tesla by almost *doubling* what I actually pay for gas and rebuilding my current truck instead of dumping it for another $3k ride.  
  
Oh, and I can pick up a load of mulch or lumber on my way home from work and there's nowhere to plug an electric in at where I work or along over half of my commute, but there's dozens of gas stations.      
   
The point I'm trying to make is that there is a reason the *average* age of a vehicle in the US is 11.5 years and rising, and a reason rural people scoff at electric vehicles and these autonomous taxi concepts. Because they're pretty impractical for where we live and don't offer us any real benefits, only complications and expenses."
I don't know... winter in Québec with a Tesla is a big ??? for me. There are many Tesla's here but usually people have an ICE and a Tesla.
"If you enter a Supercharger as a destination in your Nav, or a destination that will automatically route through Superchargers, the battery will now precondition so that it charges more quickly."
You can fill up your ICE car in less than 5 minutes and get going. There's no superchargers in most areas here up north. It's a real concern.
"If im not speeding yeah, speedlimit near me is ~ 65 mph which is only ~400miles i get about 540miles per tank if i keep to the limit and dont get stuck in traffic"
"If your route has superchargers and you arent contrained on time, i would agree."
"Maybe, i just know that most of the time on my national park visits i would end up shit out of luck about halfway back home with no good way to charge"
It just takes a fuck load longer. Everyone's points are correct.
I think the rail network is poor over in the us
The benefits of building a connected road system AFTER the advent of automobiles and high disposable income.
"Unfortunately, low population density for the majority of the country is a bitch. Even connecting major population centers can be a bitch. There is conversation about connecting Minneapolis/St. Paul with Chicago via Madison and Milwaukee, but all that distance with uncertain demand and the costs associated with building make people hesitant. I wish we had it though."
Then you have nothing to drive at the destination.

Thanks for clarifying
Astute point..
"Hydrogen fuel cell is dead. Battery EV + Solar energy is the future. Energy storage will be battery + molten salt. China will find out Hydrogen in a hard way. Those who don't understand physics still think Hydrogen has a future. It's more costly to generate, transport and store, more pollution, more difficult to handle. Of course there is also some corruption around this. A group has been pushing hard for Hydrogen.

China will likely to have a program similar to what EU is doing starts from 2020. They will force ICE out. We can watch this unfold."
"You don’t see those kind of attack’s against JLR because you’re not looking for them, you’re not invested in them like you are Tesla.

JLR are always in the media and it’s always negative. Always, at any new release any talk of investment outside of Britain, the media double down on hate for JLR just like Tesla.

Tesla let go of a similar similar amount of people as JLR but it was reported far less ... double standards ? 

Tesla aren’t the only company the media take a shot at,  they’re just the company that criticising will allow them to gain the most attention.

In the UK it’s JLR, in the US it’s Tesla"
"Well I just don't think companies like Ford and GM will really go through a production hell anywhere near what Tesla went through. 

I absolutely think it'll take a lot more money for Ford to get an EV line up, but I think this $500M investment in Rivian puts them significantly ahead of where they'd be otherwise, especially for Trucks, which is what they really care about. Literally there is no other competition besides Rivian and Tesla in the ETruck space, and by teaming up with Rivian, who looks like they're going for that Niche Adventure market, and looking to work with other companies (Amazon, Ford) for the broader market, it basically narrows it downs to Tesla... So by securing this deal with Rivian they are likely getting at least a 1-2 year jump on GM, Chrysler, Toyota in this space."
"I mean I believe it. But it is absolutely ridiculous to think that the traditional automakers are in any way worried about the actual production of these vehicles. 

If they could literally just buy Teslas design/tech/battery managment/software, and JUST manufacture the vehicles themselves, we'd be talking Tesla would be at least a year ahead of where they are today with S/3/X/Y production. It really is that simple. 

Look what the Fords and GMs do well is manufacturing. What Tesla does well is, well, everything else."
"Oh yeah Fiat resisted the fuck out of that, that's why they had to pay Tesla so much because stupid management didn't see that those fines were going to destroy them.

VW knows better so they moved in before time and managed to sell decently. Now they're finally doing the next step and actually trying to compete."
"what? First off, changing any law in the EU takes years so they still have fines.

Secondly, Tesla had nothing to do with those laws being putting there in the first place. Nothing. The laws were put in there even with big Auto lobbying. That's because lobbying in the EU is different than lobbying in the USA.

Please, do your research.

In Europe, we have been having a consistent number of EVs from a long time, Zoe Leaf and e-golf are all very popular and will be for the next years, because people don't really care about range."
"At this point it’s pretty academic though. If you get 500km out of a Model 3, then you stop and charge for 20 mins to 80%. It’s pretty much the same as a long trip and toilet break in an ICE. So yes, ultimately an ICE can put more range on in less time, but if you’ve driven for 5hrs, you’re probably going to want to stretch your legs and go to the toilet."
"20 years ago there were no cars that would have >350 mile range. In 7 years, the Tesla S has gone from 210 miles of range to 370. That's a 75% increase in range. Given another 5 years, one can assume a Tesla will be able to surpass 500 mile range. Tesla is still in the $10k LCD phase of production. Costs are dropping as supply chains get mapped out."
"This is exactly why I'm interested in an electric pickup with a range extender. Last mile rural drivers would be able to appreciate the towing capacity and no need for a generator on camping trips and job sites, and could benefit from the increased range and fuel economy. It takes a while, but some day used PHEVs will be $3k too."
"Almost no one has diesel capable of that range, so stop trying to be obtuse on purpose.

It doesn't even matter if a 8 hours trip is 9.5 hours for an electric.  If you only do 1-2 trips to year which is probably more than most people do, you are going to be perfectly fine with an EV.

You can claim it must be 5 minutes to fill up 300mi all day, 90% of the people don't need that and are fine never having to fill up for their normal day to day driving, while having a slightly longer trip 1-2 times a year.  

An EV for daily driving cannot be beat, you never have to go to gas stations anymore, you car is fully charged every morning if you want it to be with no extra work.  Plugging in a cable next to where you park is trivial.

With an EV, you spend less time filling up within the year vs adding up all the time filling up at gas stations."
"This is true, being time constrained can suck some of the fun out of it, requires a bit more planning"
"Most national parks have destination charging. Most, also have superchargers enroute that provide access from almost any location."
It's not a fuck load amount of time you need though..
"I takes me 5-10 mins to fill up, what's another 5-10 mins? 

If you had a charger at your house, you'd never have to stop to charge unless you can deplete the battery in a day."
"Specifically, passenger rail is bad. Freight is fine, bu the freight companies own the tracks and a container generally doesn't mind going at 30mph rather than 65."
"Doh of course: it’s a swap.

Tesla was going to do this IIRC but pivoted away."
"You’d think that if you did work for JLR and attended global sales meetings, one of the requirements would be to know the meaning of, and how to correctly use the word budget. I mean that’s kind of important in the finance world."
"I'm not stating my opinion, I am pointing out the Chinese state is phasing out BEV incentives by 2020 and reapplying them to FCEV's on both the manufacturer and consumer side (Using the same program).

These rollbacks are already in motion, with the exception of Beijing, who's going to phase them out at once instead of gradually.

Whether or not hydrogen has a future doesn't really change BEV's are getting more expensive with less incentive to build them over in China. Will Gigafactory China Edition be able to offset the 10% price increase their cars (along with every other BEV) will get regardless next year?"
"How come neither for nor GM can produce an electric vehicle that is price competitive with its combustion peers?  Tesla is vertically integrating very many systems. They produce their own seats. Look at the Sandy Monroe presentation, to understand how all of Tesla’s electronics are superior.

With SpaceX, Elon started producing rockets far superior in every dimension to the established aerospace companies. Anybody not believing Tesla is doing the same thing with every single facet of the automobile, is deluding themselves."
"I’m torn on VW, on one hand, they see what’s coming. On the other, you also had the whole leadership flushed due to Dieselgate, so they’re really, really under the microscope, yet that didn’t stop Mercedes from cheating more.

If there’s a charger on your route
">but some day used PHEVs will be $3k too.

PHEVs are twice as complex as a regular ICE vehicle.  
When I said $3k on the truck I was counting where I am now on it. $1,500 to buy it, $700 worth of tires in the first year, parts for another year and a half of driving, and the $600 I'm getting ready to put into rebuilding the front suspension.    
I know I got a good deal when I bought it so I went ahead and counted it that way.    
To be honest, if it became necessary I would probably just convert my existing truck to an EV myself, so that I could then repair and maintain it."
A fucking jetta can go 500 miles on a tank of gas at highway speed. Its not magic.
"Yes there are, but there is a 160 mile stretch between my house between 2 super charger ans rhe park that makes it a non starter in the winter, in the summer it would be fine"
Says who? I'm used to filling up in a few minutes for another 400 miles of range. That's the baseline.
"Hahaha I know exactly what budget means ...

We’ve budgeted to sell X amount of iPaces, and we’re substantially beating that to the point that investment in towns manufacturing sites is necessary if we want to continue EV production, especially with upcoming cars

It’s clear to me you have no idea what you’re talking about and are just a Tesla fanatic"
"In the past EVs produced in China get between $10k to $20k from the government, that money was directly given to those Chinese manufactures. I would say China wasted all the money. Tesla never got a cent of it, instead Tesla has to pay high tariff, shipping, and tax.
What happens next is Chinese EVs cost will go up by $10~20k, they may not be able to raise price by that much, so most of them will bankrupt.
Tesla can cut cost by 50% (no more tariff, no oversea shipping, low production cost in China, low parts cost). The picture will completely reverse. In summary, Chinese EVs' cost will go up a lot, Tesla EVs' cost will go down a lot. This is very bullish for Tesla starts from 2020.

China is determined to become a EV only country. They made a lot of mistakes along the way, but they will get there in the end.

Tesla's EV cost is very close to ICE vehicle's cost. The tipping point will happen first in Shanghai Gigafactory. What Chinese government should do is to add 220V chargers to every parking lot. Convert one city at a time."
"....same way Tesla can't produce an EV that is profitable at $35k.

I already know Tesla is vertically integrated and produces their own seats. And most importantly they produce their own batteries which are better and cheaper than the competition. And that improves their margins. Which only proves that it is currently very difficult to produce a profitable cheap EV. 

Far superior in EVERY dimension? ULA has 100% success rate, which is actually better than SpaceX's like 97 or 98% (like 2 big failures). Though with the amount of launches SpaceX does, it really won't matter unless they have more failures (doubtful on the Falcon 9). And while the Falcon Heavy is the most powerful rocket in operation today, it has a massively undersized Fairing - barely bigger than the Falcon 9 - which is why they aren't using Falcon Heavy to launch StarLink. Lastly one of its biggest problems is it can't be vertically integrated, which lots of military satellites need to be, which is definitely an advantage the competition has over them. Literally if they had a larger fairing and ability to vertically integrate their stages they'd be able to launch NASAs mission to the moon today...

I think you need to stop acting like I hate Tesla and start actually trying to understand what I'm saying - Ford, GM, Toyota, etc all know how to manufacture VERY well - BETTER than Tesla does. What they aren't better at than Tesla is design, technology, software, and overall Goal."
"I'll be torn on VW too until they manage to see that they can actually profit from EVs with the ID3

They did fine with the egolf so I'm sure they already have an understanding of the situation."
"Sure, and that’s the biggest drawback of EVs. If only someone would build an enormous world wide charging network..."
And most were crushed for cheating emissions to do it.
"With the LR, that should be no problem."
"That's what these fans never seem to get, unless their favored technology beats all of the baselines like the one you've pointed out people who aren't fans mostly aren't going to buy in."
"You said they are ‘selling above budget’, which doesn’t mean anything. I think what you meant to say is that they are ‘selling above list price’. 

It’s strange that you’re talking about ‘investing in towns manufacturing sites’, which I assume means that Jaguar will need to invest more in manufacturing, but here’s the crux: Jaguar don’t make the iPace, Magna Steyr produce them in Austria, this facility is not linked to Jaguar, it is a vehicle plant that produces cars for anyone who will pay them (they make the BMW Z4/Mercedes G Wagon there too). But you’d know that, working for JLR."
Tesla is the only manufacturer able to produce an EV that is price competitive with its peers.  Starting price of $35.4k up to $70k and superior to every ICE car in that category + 20% gross margin.  Wake up!
No i mean a 1.3l Gasoline jetta can get that kind of range. Its not magic. Hell my sonata gets 35-40 mpg when i go at highway speed with an 18.2 gal tank thats a lot of range
"Its a massive problem in the winter, my buddy and i tried it in his tesla, the combination of snow and having the heater on and driving slowly meant that even with a full charge teslas software predicted we wouldnt make it to the next super charger."
"Yes I’m well aware who makes the iPace I’ve been there and toured the facility...

And no by above budget I mean in order for the iPace to be successful we have production budgets which must be met, and we are selling way above them, our partners which produce the iPace AND Epace can’t keep up with demand for either.

We are currently retooling old ICE lines for EV vehicles and have tons of investment lined up. You’d know this if you had your head out of Elon’s arse"
"Really not getting your point or why you're telling me to wake up as if I'm wrong or don't know what I'm talking about. Maybe you should re-read my comments and comprehend them and what I'm actually saying before you respond. 

The reason Tesla has great vehicles isn't because they are expert manufacturers. Give Ford, GM, Toyota the EXACT same design, tech, software, and battery packs that Tesla has for the Model S/3/X, and I guarantee you, they'd be able to manufacture the vehicles quicker and cheaper than Tesla does. That's the only thing I have really said. It is simply incorrect for people to say that Ford, GM, Toyota don't know how to manufacture, or that Tesla is better at manufacturing than those traditional automakers, at least so far. It's really ridiculous to even attempt at making the argument..."
"lol, this is getting silly.  It just sacrifices passenger space for a really huge tank.

Tesla can get more range if you take out the backseat for batteries."
"Oh I’m well aware that the new XJ is going to be an EV, but if JLR is going to use the same running gear as the iPace, it’s going to fall well short of the Model S and upcoming Porsche Taycan. Until JLR (and other manufacturers) realise that efficiency is king, they’re going to have great initial sales, but they’ll drop off a cliff when people realise that they’ve bought a car which you can only drive around town. If you look at the iPace from an objective point of view it is: 

The size of a Model 3, for the price of a Model S, it has way less range and performance than either, has vastly inferior charging capability (2.5 times slower than the model 3), inferior infotainment, no autopilot, the list is endless. It does have nice leather seats, which the Tesla doesn’t have anymore."
No you cannot guarantee that.  It is a claim without evidence.  Please provide evidence.  Start with your evidence Toyota’s seats are manufactured more efficiently first and then we’ll proceed from here.
"A hyundai sonata does not sacrifice passenger space for a huge tank, lol its just that most people never actually drive their car to empty and dont realize how much is on there"
"The 200+ miles of range the iPace, Etron and EQC is more than enough for the vast majority of situations, this “town” nonsense you’re preaching is just that, nonsense.

You claim the Taycan will be have loads of range of efficiency and range yet it’s made by the same people as the E tron ... so if it is a world beater expect the VW group to throw out tons of fantastic electric cars in a short time.

I’m not doubting the Tesla is a great car, I’ll have one within weeks, but to say the competition are failing in what’s essentially their first  attempt is literally insane and really shows how stupid so many in this subreddit  are and how willing they are lie and spread sales information to make Tesla seem better.

Tesla are better by their own merits and have proved it so there no need for additional lies on top of that"
"Here is all the evidence I need:

2017 vehicle production: Toyota = 10.46 Million, GM = 6.85 Million (US), Ford = 6.38 Million, and that's not even including VW and others that are actually ahead of GM and Ford.. And lets not act like Tesla's build quality really matches the luxury vehicles of Mercedes, BMW, Audi, etc. And from a manufacturing standpoint why does it really matter if Tesla produces their own Seats. The only thing that really affects is Cost, and guess what, I can easily argue it as a negative because their seats CLEARLY have less options than other luxury seats. How many seats have cooling, can massage the driver, and have dozens of adjustments you can make...Teslas seats don't do that...

Secondly it's funny that you want to comment about the Munro interviews yet completely ignore Everything negative he has to say which is pretty much ALL about how they actually manufactured the vehicles and all the mistakes they made. You do know it's okay for Tesla to make mistakes right? That's how they learn and grow. And hopefully by the time Giga3 is up and running they will avoid all the mistakes they've already made at Freemont and Giga1...

You're completely ignoring that Elon has admitted that they made mistakes when it comes to manufacturing? Like this is a really weird hill you're trying to die on when the CEO of the company has said they messed up. Theres a reason they went less automation than they wanted. And you can ignore it all you want, stuff like Panel gaps and misaligned hoods are problems with production, which Tesla CLEARLY had pretty much all of 2018, though it is now improving. What's a problem now? Painting. There's a reason they were only offering one free color, and now have switched that color to white. It's not because white is cheaper to paint, it's because white hides defects better. And lets not even talk about Giga2, which has been completely failing at manufacturing Solar Tiles/panels.

Look I love Tesla, but lets not blind ourselves to their failures. As Elon said, if you're not failing, you're not pushing hard enough. All that matters is they learn from their mistakes, and improve so that the next time they are doing something similar they are way better. And hopefully that's what we'll see at Giga3."
"So you don’t drive a Tesla yet. When you do, you’ll understand. 200miles and sub 100kw Charging of the iPace isn’t enough. 

The Taycan and Etron might be from the same parent company, but they are vastly different cars. The E tron is literally a Q5 with a battery pack, and it shows with poor efficiency and lacklustre performance compared with other EVs. The Taycan is a ground up platform, so while it’s battery chemistry isn’t the best in terms of Wh/kg, it will certainly be more efficient than the Etron. It has a completely different 800V architecture, charged at 2.5 times the speed of the Etron (on launch) with the promise of 350kw later (but I’m not sure that will happen). It’s a better step in the right direction. Basically the E tron is a legacy chassis rushed to market (like the EQC), the Taycan is a ground up design which is superior. I do feel they probably got the maths wrong on battery chemistry/efficiency though. The Taycan was designed with a battery chemistry that allows for faster charging at the expense of efficiency, which juxtaposes the Model 3, which has efficiency as its primary purpose, albeit with slower charging. It now looks like with V3 that the Model 3 and Taycan will charge at the same peak KW, (the Taycan probably has a better taper curve), but because the Model 3 is more efficient, it looks like it will probably put more range on per hour. It will be interesting to see.

So before you call people liars, perhaps you should gain some real life experience owning one and some understanding of the technical differences between the cars."
I see you don’t understand what constitutes evidence.
"I have driven more EVs than most. I’ve owned an iPace for a few weeks, and an Etron.

I know more about the manufacture of the Etron then most because a few years ago when it was being developed I worked alongside the VW group.

Please stop telling me common knowledge like it’s going to make you look clever. It doesn’t.

I have driven every Tesla available including the old roadster, I’ve lived with  a  pre face lift Model S for half a year.

I currently work alongside battery development teams in the design of next generation EV motors, so yeah when I’m calling people liars such as yourself it’s because I know for a fact you’re lying.

You’ve lied about the iPace, or rather you’ve spread misinformed rubbish, and now you’re attempting to subvert that with more regurgitated rubbish about the VW group.

I’m well aware the EQC and ETron are premium compliance cars, the fact that with very little effort they’ve been released to decent reviews just shows that whilst Tesla currently make the best powertrain it’s only a matter of time before money talks and sadly for Tesla fanatics VW group have all the money in the world 

Either way, I’m done with responding to as like I said previously it’s clear you’re just a Tesla fanatic and actually know very little about the car industry or even EVs outside of Tesla"
"I see you expect others to provide all evidence to support their claim, and never do so yourself lol. I did provide evidence. Their production numbers are literally evidence. Tesla LITERALLY can NOT produce vehicles at close to the same rate as the other companies. They want to get to a rate of 500k/yr by the end of this year, meanwhile those other companies I mentioned are at a sustained rate 12-20 TIMES greater..."
"You’ve literally come in here, had a tanty, called me a liar, but not actually refuted any of my claims, and now you’ve thrown all your toys out of the pram. And apparently you own an iPace, Etron, Tesla and soon to own another Tesla. Seems like a lot of EVs for one man. If you look through my post history, you’ll see I’m not a Tesla fanatic, and challenge much of the crap that is hypothesised. Your net contribution equates to zero, you’ve not contributed to the debate, you’ve come in here to call me names, and now you’re leaving. Pathetic. Man up and pull apart my posts, or shut up and get the fuck out."
"I thought your point was that the other’s manufacturing was superior, I.e. more cost effective.  That is where you gave no evidence.  If your point was only that they produce more currently, well then Duh!"
"It’s my job to know about JLR. I work there. I don’t need to backup my claims because I’m not in the business of risking my job to prove to random idiots on the internet.

I had an IPace for several weeks, perks of the job, just like I had an Etron  and a Tesla. We do vehicle tear downs and reverse engineering so yes we get fleet vehicles in and use them.

I have an Tesla Model 3 performance on the way because it’s the best vehicle in its price range by far"
"How many you can produce is absolutely a major example of manufacturing ability, especially when Tesla NEEDS to produce as many vehicles and batteries as possible to reduce their costs (economies of scale). Look how long it has taken Tesla to ramp their Model 3 production. They literally had to strip out a lot of the automation and then build a new assembly line in a tent. Plus the amount of people they were using in the factory per car being produced was way higher than the other automakers. It's like you don't even believe Elon. Elon has literally said they made a mistake trying to over-automate.

Sorry but honestly arguing that Tesla which has had a crap load of manufacturing problems in the past year alone, is superior AT MANUFACTURING to Toyota is just ridiculous. And I'm not the one that actually needs to give evidence to that. If you want to say Tesla is better than the best manufacturing companies in the world and who created the assembly line, then you should be the one to provide the evidence. 

Glad you're a fan of Tesla, but let's not be completely blind to their problems."
"So accurately refute one of my technical claims. I dare you. And specifically tell me where I lied. Do tell me though, how come two posts ago you owned an iPace and Etron and now suddenly they become pool cars. Just another mistruth huh? Who really is the liar here?"
"The only way to compare would be if Toyota was capable of building an equivalent to Model 3.

Considering that for decades Lexus has been trying to build a BMW three series competitor, and has never been successful, I seriously doubt they have ever been capable of this kind of achievement."
"Owned as in, in my possession. I never said I purchased them.

I “own” a company car too if that helps you understand basic English"
"You’ve made no claims that aren’t common knowledge.

You have made wildly false claims about JLR and the iPace to someone who literally lives it day in day out.

For that reason alone I have no reason to believe a thing you say in regards to basically anything that doesn’t push your Tesla rhetoric"
"Okay, do you understand the difference between the actual Tech, Design, Software, etc of the vehicle being manufactured, and the actual Manufacturing of said vehicle? 

I've said repeatedly that what makes Tesla better is the first things I listed, but that when it comes to actually manufacturing the vehicle, that's where their biggest struggles are. For traditional automakers, it's the opposite. Honestly I'm done explaining this to you, cause you clearly can't comprehend it.."
"My basic English isn’t in question, yours is. As is everything you say. You literally haven’t been able to tell me a single ‘lie’ I said."
"Tesla struggled mightily on the model three ramp. However, they were also attempting to build an alien dreadnought factory. Yes they failed, but I would bet anything they’ve learned a lot of lessons, and created a lot of innovations that are going to make their next factory be one of the top in the world. I would bet even their present production line is pretty damn good.

So you’ve got two companies doing two completely different types of things. Toyota is trying to refine the current manufacturing technology to its best state. Tesla is trying to completely overturn and revolutionize it."
"Ok, what meetings about the iPace do you attend where JLR speak about disappointing sales ?"
"Okay, so how exactly does that make Tesla BETTER TODAY at manufacturing than anyone else? I have literally never said that Tesla couldn't revolutionize Manufacturing or wouldn't eventually become one of the best at it, or anything else. Just that everything we have seen about Model 3 manufacturing up to today shows Tesla isn't yet as good at manufacturing as the traditional automakers. I'm glad they're taking risks to try to improve the process, but stop acting like Ford, GM, Toyota and the like don't know how to manufacture, when they are probably the best manufacturing companies in the world. 6 of the top 10 largest manufacturing companies in the world by revenue are auto companies, and they've been doing this for decades. Tesla is still learning."
"I was making fun of your bullshit claims pal, re read the post. I made that very clear, work on your inference.

Again, for the third time, specifically what have I lied about? Don’t avoid the question, answer it."
"I never claimed Tesla was better than everyone else.  If I were to speculate I’d go on these facts.
1) SpaceX is way better at manufacturing than the Aerospace giants.  They achieved this by looking at every single aspect of rocket manufacturing.  If you don’t believe Tesla has been doing that as well, I feel you’re naive.
2) Elon has stated they are currently at world class and soon to be better.

You claimed Tesla was worse, with no evidence."
"I didn’t avoid the question, I just gave you an example of rubbish you’ve spouted to back up your claim that the iPace isn’t selling to JLRs liking.

Also if you read back to my comment I said people in this sub often lie to make Tesla look better, I never specifically said you.

“Aren’t jaguar going bankrupt” 
“Efficiency is the king” when clearly it’s not if people are purchasing more expensive cars with less range"
"Jaguar would be bankrupt now if it wasn’t for Tata writing off their £3.4b loss two quarters ago. You did call me a liar, twice, and you haven’t been able to refute anything I’ve said. These are the facts: the iPace is an inferior car to any Tesla on the market now. It does have better seats, because Tesla dumped their Napa leather two years ago. In all other facets, it is inferior. I get that you’re a JLR f boy, but like you’ve mentioned in your posts, this for Jaguar is a gen 1 car, and Tesla are on Gen 5 now. Of course their cars are going to be better. You seem to be fixated on the fact that the Europeans will catch up and surpass Tesla, and maybe they will, but they are years behind on the drive trains. The big hope is the Taycan, but right now it really looks like competition for the Model 3 performance, for the price of the Model S. I think we’re all aware that Tesla isn’t standing still. I’d be fairly confident that Tesla has the rumoured 3 motor Model S with the 2020 Roadster drivetrain waiting in the wings. As soon as Model S/X sales really drop off a cliff, or the Taycan starts stealing sales, they’ll launch a 400mile+ range 250kw charging Luxury sedan on the market, with the super bottle cooling system. Game over."
"They never made a 3.4 billion “loss”

that “loss” is a write down in the value of some of its investments. It’s had no influence on all the positive cash flow they have 

And they returned to profit the quarter after. 

Once again you’re spreading misinformation in order to further your argument. 

JLR couldn’t survive a loss like that and not could Tata Motor, they could also jot afford the several expansions they’re making in Gaydon, Whitley, Slovakia and Castle Brom if that were the case ...

Also if you’re not a liar, explain to me how I’m wrong in saying that the IPace is selling above budget and above production capacity since you seem to have some knowledge I’m not privy too

Final Edit - The iPace isn’t an inferior car, it just has an inferior powertrain. A car is more than that, regardless of what you think. People who like cars know that, and people who see them as just transport will be happy with  Renault Zoe, so it’s in your best interest to come to they realisation of you want a premium automaker like Tesla to survive and prosper"
"I’d say the iPace is inferior to the Model 3 Performance in every way. Well apart from the leather seats. 

And if I’m a liar, so is the BBC

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47155145

You haven’t been able to quantify a single lie I supposedly made, so I would suggest you back off from making accusations and think about what you post. Try and add something instead of attacking other users. If you do work for JLR (which is pretty suspect to be honest, given your posts), I would suggest you come here to learn rather than lecture. There’s a lot you clearly don’t know and understand about EVs (but your excuses are strong, classic marketing man)."
"Well interior quality as a whole is far superior to the Model 3 

It also is far more comfortable to drive and soaks up the road so well, it is designed by SUV specialists after all 

The BBC clearly say the “loss” is down to them reducing the value of their assets and investments.  It’s in the first few lines... it’s not a loss in money and doesn’t effect cash flow or future investments of which JLR are making many.

You can doubt my credentials all like, but I’d gladly prove them  for any potential doubters who aren’t insane fanboys"
"You haven’t proved anything other than your ability to make accusations. And SUV specialists? Really? The F type is a piece of junk compared to something like an X5, the E Pace is an overpriced Mazda CX-5, and despite what you’ve said in earlier posts, the iPace is not an off-road vehicle. If you think it is, you clearly have very little understanding of off-road vehicles. I’m not a f boy, but I do know that JLR makes a plethora of cars that are inferior to their German rivals, across the entire range, perhaps with the exception of the Range Rover Sport, which in HSE and above form is a more rounded vehicle than an X5 or GLE (as long as you don’t care about the terrible infotainment system). The full sized Range Rover is hopelessly outclassed by the new G class, the lower LR offerings are a joke and the Disco is great, but ugly, but for that money, most people would buy a Landcruiser 200. 

Nothing has changed with their first attempt at an EV. Better luck next time I guess. Let’s just hope they don’t make the mistake of putting the exact same drive train with the two inefficient permanent magnet motors in the new XJ."
"Yes SUV specialists lol 

X5 is Range Rover Sport competition not the F-Pace (Not F Type)

The F Pace is easily a match for the X5 that was released around the same time. The current X5 is a generation ahead of the F Pace 

And the E-Pace is a great little car.

Can I ask what experience you actually have with these vehicles ? Cause I’m honestly doubting you can even drive now.

Also I guaranteed the iPace is better off-road than the Model X and Y 

As far as being inferior to the Germans, inferior in what way ? Driving dynamics ask any reviewer and they’ll tell you the XE XF and XJ are class leading, but once again I doubt you’ve driven any of them."
"And again with that insults. You can’t keep it in the bag, can you? You’ve come here looking for a fight, you’ve had one, you’ve contributed nothing other than to ratify your blind love for JLR. Conversation over, have a nice life."
I have to get out more because I’ve never seen a night sky where you can see the Milky Way with plain eyes. Where does one get to see this?
"If you use a gradation filter, it will lower the exposure of the chargers and up the detail from the stars, FYI"
"Location , camera/lens and settings plz :D"
How long was your exposure?  Just curious.
"From the thumbnail on my Reddit on my phone I thought that poor thing is on fire, phew!!!"
Do all Superchargers light up like this? I think it looks cool but I could see people complaining. I suppose it's not much worse than streetlights or gas station lights that are on 24/7.

Lovely image. I wish the mods kept mine before removing it and recommending I submit to /r/TeslaLounge instead.
How did you find a supercharger in a place with no light pollution?!?
I can this being the cover of a magazine
Shopped can tell by the pixels
I’m pretty sure a Tesla has a price
Thank you for the new phone background!!
Might fit in nicely over at r/outrun
i wish we could see that from europe :(
Now that’s what I call solar charging.
Thanks for the wallpaper 😁
Looks kinda photoshopped
Nice Photoshop.
"You’re kidding me right? You’re gonna post on here and pass off like you have an amazing picture? You took a photo of the car at a station, added some effects to the charger lights and photoshopped the galaxy in. If you didn’t leave such a hard edge around the outline of the trees, I’d say it’d be alright. But that’s just bad. Make your lie believable before you post it."
"There is a global light pollution map which shows you areas of most and least light pollution. You can see hints of the milky way in light to dark blue areas and see it fully in grey through black areas.

 [https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/](https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/)"
"This isn’t what you’ll see at that location. The long exposure is a lot of what is making the view look so great. I don’t think any Tesla charging stations exist at dark sites. 

If you are far enough away from major cities you’ll be able to see something like this on the right night."
It’s camera exposure settings. It does not look like this to the naked eye.
"Like others said, a long exposure will give you this type of photo (which is also why bottom of photo is so red from the supercharger lights being over exposed).  Very awesome photo though!

If you want to see this with your eyes, find a lake that has island camping (like Lake George, NY, for example) and rent an island in the middle of the lake.  It’s super cheap ($28/night) and on a clear night sky, you will see the Milky Way like this.  And it is amazing."
"The darkest place you can get to, and also no Moon in sight. The moon light “eats” the stars away. This was taken in a winery hotel in the middle of nowhere"
I think he had a long exposure photo to capture this shot. That's why there is so much red glare from the chargers and why the night sky is so clear.
"Neither did OP. This is long exposure photograph with a camera, that's why the entire bottom of the photo is so red, because it's a longer exposure which ends up capturing more of the light over time. This is absolutely not what the naked eye would see. I'm sure you've seen supercharger lights, now compare them to these here, notice how these are increadibly bright.

PS: still a great photo with good technique, just saying that a human eye would not see this."
"I have heard stories about cities suffering a power outage at night, citizens calling the police because of this “strange thing in the sky”, that strange thing called the stars and outer space…

I have good recollection of Stars and meteor showers, no active memories of the color and Milky Way. I definitely need to do something about that too."
Not a single supercharger will be in a dark enough place to see the Milky way. Use that light pollution map and get out in the country and look at the stars!
This is also long exposure as fuck so it will be exaggerated
I’ve never seen it with the naked eye but OPs picture is definitely a long exposure maybe a few seconds. You can tell by the red plants in the background because the lights kinda bleed everywhere in long exposures. Not a bad thing though it’s really cool to take those pictures. I had a tripod and could get the Milky Way with maybe 3-5 second shots while I was on my road trip in Joshua tree last summer.
If you get away from the city it’s not too hard.
"This is a doctored image, of you look at the tree tops you can see where the poor mask job was done. The reds are also over done, breaking it."
Nowhere.  This is all photoshop.
I want to know the same thing!
Could this filter be applied in post production for the same effect?
Or you can do a composite shot where the foreground is a lower exposure time and the background is a longer exposure time and the two are blended together.  Something that is often done with landscape Milky Way photos.

"Not OP, but I would assume around 45 seconds. Much longer and the stars would start to streak due to earths rotation. Much less time and he’d need to run a lot larger aperture ruining the detail"
It was 15 or 20 second
"I thought of Children of the Corn, myself"
Long exposure amplifies the perceived light casting
"I like ’em bright enough so I can see them from 100 miles away. 

All kidding aside, this photo is the product of a long camera exposure. It may be how you could see if you could swap eyes with an owl or a tiger."
"This was in Montemor, Portugal"
😅that’s so awesome. Thanks!
With a camera and a 20 second exposure. Check out YouTube on how to shoot the night sky. It’s great!
Thanks. It’s definitely was. Getting out of the car and looking at that my was something else
"Montemor, Portugal"
Thanks a lot
Thanks. Glad you liked it
Thank you 😊
One shot edited on Lightroom
Thanks a lot. Means a ton!
"Long exposure isn't photoshop nor do you need photoshop or any image manipulation program for that

It's kinda weird how overused the ""photoshop"" buzzword that it gets used for any image that isn't a 1:1 replica of what you would see with your eyes"

Another related note. Anyone know what's causing the light pollution in the North sea between the UK and Norway?  Is it off shore oil rigs?
"I always thought I lived in an area of low light pollution, being in rural Texas and all. But apparently anywhere between Dallas and OKC is a bad place to see the Milky Way."

The one in Lone pine is pretty dark. You might not see the milky way this clearly at the charger but drive 5 minutes away on a moonless night and you will
I still think something like this is impossible to see. I’ve shot the Milky Way hundreds of new moon nights and they never look like what a long exposure makes them out to be
Definitely. But you can get pretty damn close in areas with little light pollution.
"Can you give island details where you can see this in NY, it's been my dream and I couldn't find a place where I could see like this."
Which middle of nowhere?  In case I ever have reason to charge there.
"If there is no moon, the Milky way won't be blue. You used a weird white balance. ""Daylight"" is the real white balance."
"With the eye it really looks like someone spilled some milk over the sky, hence why people named it galaxy. It doesn't look like on any image but still very beautiful"
"No, not really. Once the light clips, the details is lost entirely. Using the gradient filter will allow more detail from the night sky before blowing out the lights in the city/chargers."
"Boa foto, sinceramente nem sabia que existiam superchargers em Portugal."
Portugal?? Não sabia que dava para ver tanto detalhe da via láctea cá. Ou então é só a câmara que vê ?
Knowing nothing about photography I figured it would have been much longer (10 minutes or something).  Good to know it's not that long.  Thanks for the info!
I think there’s stacking. The trees look quite awkward at the edges.
"Yeah, likely a smaller aperture for that DoF. They can streak at 25 seconds (at least with my 35mm), but it’s also a wide lens so you can go a little longer with the exposure and not have streaks. I wonder if it’s the focal length, bumped up iso, or used motion tracking software for the sky and did a composite? Cool pic."
That's a good point. They needed it for the shot of the stars.
"Truely is amazing shot. What did you use to take the picture? Is it 2 shots blended (one sky focused and one car focused) or one original picture?

My cousin-in-law took [this picture](http://imgur.com/a/pHv2sGT) in Arizona and it was originally 2 seperate photos and mixed into one, as the tents would mess up the contrast due to them being so bright, so one was taken with the tent lights off and one on then spliced. He has a portfolio of images like this from all across the world, he's a professional night photographer"
Ahh nice
i live around the Rhine-Ruhr area in germany :D
"But you enlarged the galaxy in your picture. It doesn’t line up the exact same when layered over. I must admit, the charger lights look good with the filter. But the galaxy looks good as is. I’d much rather see a picture like that and know it’s real than see this one and immediately know it’s been worked on. The hard outline is what killed it. That plus the crazy red/pink and blue lighting around the trees."
"As a hobbyist photographer - awesome shot!!  Can I ask what focal length & aperture & ISO you were shooting at?  I see you said it was a 15-20 second exposure.

I’d like to guess 6mm fisheye, F5.5, ISO 800?"
Vermont and some of north-western mass has several dark sites. Maine definitely has dark sites. Obviously anything near New York or other huge cities will be dog shit.

"Any area that would show something like this would not have a Tesla charging station. That much of the milky way requires you to be completely out of civilization; I went camping at the northern part of Lake Superior a few years back, took 12 hours to drive there, no city within 100km, the closest town to our campground (which had no employees) was a 30 minute drive away. Even with all of that, you still couldn't see the milky way this well. You could probably get this good a look if you went out onto one of the islands. Long exposure + heavy Photoshop"
Yeah [check this out](https://www.lakegeorge.com/lodging/camping-campgrounds/lake-george-islands/) . Narrows island is where I’ve been going yearly with friends and I’ve see. The sky like this a handful of times in clear nights on the islands.

It’s sad what light pollution has done to us!
I used a Fuji XT3 with an 8mm lens. This is actually just one shot. That’s why the supercharging lights are so blown out. Thanks for the comment!
Yes it does. I didn’t enlarge anything. I did crop it of course.
"Also this is a 20 second exposure. The goal was the sky, that’s why the stalls are so bright"

"I mean obviously, the exposure and editing have a lot to do with it. But you can still get pretty great views of the milky way in some places. Last year I went up to the top of Mt. Evans on a clear night and had a spectacular view. That's just 60 miles from downtown Denver and there is a supercharger being built just 30 miles from the summit.

If I can find the pictures I took I'll upload them here. Most were long exposures, but I have a few that are meant to be a little more true to life."

I wasn't sure what wattage your panels are."
"Congratulations from a fellow Sun worshiper in Vermont.

Out Model 3 (LR AWD) is, at least in the Summer, totally powered by out 11.3KW system. Home and car use adds up to about 800KWH.  In Summer months, we produce 1-1.5MW.

We also have 2 powerwalls in the basement.  Our total utility bill monthly (the minimum service charge) has been around $15, replacing ALL power and gas purchases. 

Everything over goes into net metering credits that will hopefully get us well into Winter. We dont know yet. Car came in late November and PV in mid October so we have yet to see a full year."
Pretty damn mind boggling how you said it.  A car that runs purely off sun's energy with zero emission in the 21st century.  The era of electric cars has arrived whether people like it or not and Tesla is 110% leading the charge.  Congrats on the new solar panels!
Damn tesla makes some sexy panels
Fusion power at a distance
"Congrats.

My parents are getting 16KW by the end of the year. I’m super excited for them"
Man....I want solar!!!! My house/roof isn't suited for it though.
"Untrue! It's way too hot to run a car there. 

This is a joke it's German humor, please look kind on it. It is endangered and all that."
"I like your layout!  Very bold going for both surfaces.

I suspect you went with a ""larger"" system due to your 3,000 sq ft A/C requirements?"
I just started this process 2 weeks ago in Scottsdale AZ. 8Kwh system + powerwall installed. 32k and getting 30% back on everything via tax credit + 1000 from AZ + $3600 from SRP for the powerwall :) excited. It says expect installation to start 4 to 6 mo after order (permits and more)
I wish Tesla enters the solar market in Michigan. Not sure if the court battle with the state of MI over selling cars is stopping them from entering the solar market. I put my deposit in for these panels a while back and haven’t heard anything yet. They even refunded my $99 deposit but I can still see the reservation in my Tesla page with a message saying we will get in touch with you when we come to your state. I have looked at other installers but the panels that Tesla provides are so much better looking.
If I may ask what was the total cost of solar panel setup?
Same. 10.4kw model 3! Epic.
The garage seems to be bigger than the house.
*Taste the Suuuuuuuuuuuun*
Now you can eat sunlight!
Congratulations sir you have an amazing set up.
Sunny D?
 Feckin Captain Obvious checking in...I never knew any of the Tesla's had a stealth mode....
I am lucky enough to have a 13.2kw system across 2 phases with a polyphase gateway and Powerwall 2 ready and waiting for my model 3. Awaiting delivery in August in Australia.
"Looks great! I just got my permit last week, doing a little 3.6kw ground mount DIY. It's been a hell of a process, but I think it'll be smooth sailing for the build now. Probably won't cover my model 3 consumption, but it should cover home usage."
bUt prOdUciNG BatTeriES Is As bAd fOr tHe eNviRoNmEnt!
"Tesla did great by lowering the cost to $8000 for 4kW. $58/month is a fairly cheap power bill, and the system provides up to like 650kWh per month in summer.. seems like a no brainer for almost everyone.. I feel like Tesla could install a WHOLE LOT MORE solar setups with better marketing.. just advertise it as $59/month with the Tesla brand.

I hope they continue to lower the price over time."
As much as I would love to install with Tesla they were just way too expensive. About 20-30% more than local installers who have probably done more jobs in my city than Tesla has. Tesla used to price match local installers but then stopped doing it for some reason.
Damn that title is accurate AF
Yea but your ROI is in 20+ yrs. So there's that
Better be tan as hell too m8
"How much of (i.e. percentage) a nearly empty Tesla battery (like a 60 kw one at %10 charge) a can be charged by these  solar panels visible in the picture , like in a sunny summer day bw. 8 am and 6 pm?"
so your Tesla is now sunrun? 😄
How does one even afford this? I know it’s quite expensive can you give me a rundown of how much you pay per month and other things like that if you can?
"It will be interesting to see what your yield will be.  Also, as a Tacoman, I’m assuming the majority if not all of your power is hydro.  Why did you choose to go solar in the PNW?"
Do you get snow in Seattle? I am wondering on doing the same thing in Norway. How much did it cost?
thats got to be expensive af roof
Where are you located?  I WANT this badly but is Michigan a good candidate?  Someone said boatloads of sun in Vermont but perhaps lake effect keeps us shadier here?  Very cool set up.  Congrats
"OP, i know you are flooded with comments, but i cant find an answer to this. Can your charge a tesla directly off of solar? And can you charge a tesla at night off the power wall? I keep hearing that the tesla pulls too much energy to be able to charge from home solar and the power wall. Is that true? 

Id really like to go full solar..."
"Whooaahh...What a cute house!!

&#x200B;

Good for you with everything you're doing!!"
How many suns are in a full charge?
The dream right there! Congratulations!
You’re like in the future while the rest of us are in the past...
"This is great! Tesla comes this Friday to do my initial inspection. 

Can you share a picture of how it looks hooked up to your panel? Are there controllers/switches, etc?"
Side skirts are where it’s at!!!
Where are your plumbing vents? My front roof with the best sun exposure has vents everywhere :(
That was how God intended!
"It’s amazing how many people have said something about the house lol just because it’s not a Mcmansion. Awesome looking panels, super happy to hear you were able to get Tesla to do it. If you don’t mind me asking what was the total cost?"
taste the *s u n*
"Congrats! Next up: it’s fun to also drive your Tesla on MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, and SAT."
Man I wish I had that kind of money.
"Ha, reading this caused me to look up companies in my area since Tesla doesn’t install where I am. Found a highly rated installer, filled out the questionnaire, and they responded almost immediately. After a back and forth she asks, “are you aware of the demand charge in KS?”  A quick google and I find that KS basically charges you extra for generating your own power and not buying more coal. I’m not terribly surprised because Kansas, but I’m so tired of these backwards ass politicians."

"Hi quick question for you, your 10k system is that expected to power your full electricity needs for your 3k sqft house and model 3? I am in the Seattle area and doing some preliminary research on adding a solar panel system with batteries, but want more real world anecdotal evidence as to the size of the system compared to how that will cover you in terms of electricity. Especially in the winter time here how much electricity will it generate."
"I have a 9.45kwh system.  This summer with the ac on and the tesla charging, last billing cycle drained our 75$ credit down to $6 credit left.  we still got july, august, and september to look forward too.  I should of gotten a bigger system, like a 16kwh.  The trick right now is to alternate cars.  one week, tesla, one week prius."

You will soon be taxed for that energy collecting.
"""Whatcha got under the hood of that thing?""

"Sodium hydroxide and hydrofluoric acid with the solar panels. Lithium extracted in South America or extracted in Australia and sent to China. Toxic chemicals leaching into the water supply. 500,000 gallons of water per ton of lithium lost in drought ridden areas. Contaminated irrigation streams and groundwater. Coal fired economies processing the lithium. Caustic chemicals making both processes. No ecosystem for recycling lithium batteries. Sadly no ones saving the environment through these externally Earth conscious actions. Minds in the right place for sustainability. I wish we were closer..."
Not to be a Debbie Downer but that looks like a 1k square foot house at most.  Great for two dudes/dudets fresh out of college renting but not practical at all for a family.
That's an amazing shed dude.
"Just need power wall! But it's the only part that doesn't generate or save money, at least in my case. If power prices fluctuated during the day then it would, but with a flat rate system it's just security."
"What ever happened to the solar roof tiles? I never saw the point, current PV setups aren't that ugly but yeah, can people buy the Tesla tiles?"
What solar modules does Tesla usually use?
Those solar panels are made by Tesla?
As a Tesla stock holder I was furious that they wouldn't return my calls or emails when I wanted to add solar + PW to my new house I bought in March.  This was just after they switched to online ordering system.  They finally got back to me after a local installer was finished with the job.
"> As a Tesla employee, I LOVE to see this. Taking advantage of the full Tesla ecosystem

You do? Then what are you doing here, wasting time on Reddit? Go make batteries faster, god damn it! ;-)

Fully scaled up Tesla will be glorious..."
Any advice for someone thinking about doing this?
"Wow, that's a thicc solar system"
"When I saw that house I was *certain* it had to be Seattle area. I grew up in Gig Harbor, and it just looked eerily familiar to me, right down to the font for the house numbers.

Fabulous looking install!"
"We are looking into tesla solar but would obviously want it turned on by the end of the year for the tac rebate, should I order the panels now online? Hoping it doesn't take 6 months for the install so I can get the 30% rebate."
Why did you choose to go with tesla
I think they are 315-320watt panels. I'd have to look up the details. Tesla doesn't really share that unless you pester them haha where every other company says which panel down to the model number. The order forms just say Panasonic.
Congrats to you too! We have a whole other roof side which we may expand to in the future. We'll see how 10kw does 😀
Did you also convert water heater and HVAC to electric/heat pump?
Green Mountain Power?
Thanks!
Lol really the main difference is the side skirts.
They're like having an art installation on your roof. My neighbor saw my install and liked it so much he went online to order a system for himself.
Wirelessly transmitted power
Indirect Fusion
"Yeah, was supposed to get 12kw, but their original design didn't fit."
"Yeah, for us we wished the sunny side was the rear of the house, but at least the panels look pretty decent. 

&#x200B;

Maybe it's time to put up a wind turbine :D"
"Keep an eye out for community solar that's coming to to some cities and states.

Panels are installed in a big field, you pay for however many you want, and then you get the credits.

Its picking up steam and those that live in condos, townhouses and apartments join in the green energy movement.

www.stltoday.com/business/local/ameren-reports-strong-interest-in-solar-energy-subscription-program/article_5a9d8e2b-6d43-500f-ae02-73f5f7a52f7f.amp.html"
"Do you have a patio/yard/porch you could put a shade structure on?  A couple of local installers near us specialize in exactly that, where they build a pergola or whatever specifically to hold solar panels in situations where there isn't great roof layout.  Conveniently, this often means the shade structure is eligible for the federal solar tax credit as well, since it was a necessary part of the install."
Partly. Heat pump and two EVs eat up a fair amount of KW😀
"Yeah, gotta order quick to get that 30%"
"Sucks! Good luck with that. Their panels aren't super special, but having everything all in one place is nice."
"Ya, that’s so dumb.  Politicians restricting car sales to keep competition out..."
$25k. May differ in your area based on fees and labor.
It's a sleeper house. 3000sqft.
Thanks!
Except with less chemicals 🤣
Sounds sweet!
Good luck!
No batteries. Just need positive solar tired to grid. Only thing I lose is my panels don't work in a few of
So is making solar panels... really caustic chemicals.
"Agreed. In our area it was still a bit more than that due to install costs, but still they went from ""paying for the brand name"" to actually competitive."
"We were going to go local until Tesla lowered their prices. The cheapest system around us was 9.6KW for $24.5K, so Tesla coming in at 10.1KW for $25.5K was worth it."
"I realize this varies rather a lot... but we went solar in 2009, and the full payback point was at about 5.5 years.  People *still* constantly do the ""it'll never pay for itself"" thing when it comes up in conversation, and always seem genuinely astonished that it's been paid for *for years*, with more than a decade left on the warranty."
More like 12 years.
"On average it should be like 30kwh a day (so 50% of a 60kwh battery), though in the summer that's more like 50 and the winter more like 10."
With a REALLY short cord 😉
"Don't remember the exact number, but it should be like $125 a month after tax rebates. Should generate like $100 in electricity. But as energy rates increase it will save me more."
Still cheaper than the grid in the long run. Just means my grid power is pretty clean too.
"I have a solar system in Canada.   Where I am we tend go go through freeze thaw cycles during the winter so I don't even bother cleaning them off.   Depending on the setup I make so little power in the winter it isn't really even worth the time cleaning them.   I make roughly 10,000 kWhs a year with my 9kW system but by far most of that is in the summer months.  For example in the past year my production in November to February was 897 kWhs and June through September was 4,617‬ kWhs.   How much you will make is dependent on the size and how the orientation of the panels is.   Also depending on the angle they may shed show pretty quickly."
"I live in the NorthEast and get snow on my system. (18 panels)

The biggest factor is your ease of access to the panels, and the slope of your roof.

Our current panels are in the front yard, and to clean them off after heavy snow would be tough. Our next set is going to be over our garage, and I can stand in my driveway to wipe the snow off. Once you get a little bit exposed, the panels heat up and the snow slide off."
"We do, but not much and not usually. Maybe 2 inches a year on average."
$25k. Not bad when you consider the savings too.
"Generally in the US you are either a good candidate or a great candidate. The bigger factor is how many shade trees you have and what direction your house faces. Having a huge roof slope facing South with minimal tree shade is best. If you have many acres then your other option is ground solar in a field away from the house.

Obviously do your own research but I think it's worth your time."
"It's more about latitude. Ironically, being too hot actually reduces the efficiency of solar panels. And the best orientation is actually west facing, rather than south facing."
We are near Seattle so you should get just about the same amount of sun. You just get more snow 😉
"You'd need multiple power walls if you wanted to charge from the batteries. In our case power wall didn't make sense so we feed the grid and then use the grid at night.

Helps that the grid here is hydro 😀"
Thanks!
2-4
Thanks!
"Solar panels from the 1970s still work, so somewhere there is someone from the past still in the future?"
My regular panel or the side panel for solar that is outside?
"Guessing mine are on the back side. Haven't checked, but would make sense to hide them behind."
"$25K, though that will be less if you live in a cheaper area.

And I don't mind the house comments haha our house looks like the smallest on the block, but it's actually one of the largest. Who wants to steal from the shack when there is larger targets next door :)"
"No, I work :("
"$0 down, $125 a month for one this size. Shouldn't end up being much more a month than your power bill."
"Yeah, some places solar SHOULD make sense but doesn't ☹️"
"No, though we use more power than most homes. Two EVs, heat pump, two people work from home, etc. This should make around 10-11k kwh a year, but we use around 16k.

If you didn't have a heat pump you would probably have basically all covered."
Yet another victim of kW vs kWh
Thanks!
"Kinda like rain water 🤣 ""it's everyone's rain!"""
"Commented this elsewhere, but it's over 3000sqft. Daylight basement."
Haha we like the house because outside it looks tiny but it's over 3000sqft.
"Work from home alot? If not you can use the powerwall to store up the energy the sun in generating during the day to use at night. AND, if you had paired it with the panels, it is eligible for the 30% tax credit but not if purchased by itself. Too late for that though :/ Love the way panels look on the house! Congrats and your patience is appreciated! (by me at least)"
I have a PW2 and it saves me a TON of money in CA with TOU.   I would have needed a much larger system if I didn't have it.   I don't generate nearly as much as I use but I come out way ahead $$ wise.      PW was pretty close to free with tax rebate and SGIP rebate.
"First, grats on the combo. The 4 power walls we got made all the difference for our home in CA for charging the Model 3. The debt hurt a bit from stacking the 3 things together, but factoring in feeding the grid, keeping the a/c on, and saving on gas, it'll balance out way before the mortgage is up."
It does save money if you have high usage and time of use rates.  I plan to load my battery at night and use during peak
Solar panels from Tesla?
"Wait, you have no storage?

So you only charge your car during the day? That is a pretty odd schedule."
They are more expensive and not as efficient.
"I think Tesla is overstaffed.. No idea what's going on in there, they have several headquarters, factories, I'm curious if 45,000 employees are actually needed.. That's a hell of a lot of people, and most of us won't ever need to see anyone except the mobile service guys.. More automation and more online sales certainly seems to be the way to go."
"Plan for it to take WAY longer than expected. We started this process back in February. Month long delays multiple times waiting to get Tesla out here and then to schedule the install. Now it may take another month to get them turned on.

Their new sales system is set to multiples of 4KW (we were grandfathered in) so be sure that fits your roof. If not it may be better to use another company. 

But Tesla's finance program is the best we've seen. They assume you will roll the 30% tax credit into your bill so they start billing you the smaller amount right away."
"Get multiple quotes, treat solar salesman like used car salesman (don't take their word and negotiate ruthlessly), use EnergySage to get multiple quotes quickly and easily (multiple quotes is the best way to save money)."
"If solar is new to your town/city/county, be prepared for lots of delays while they figure out the code/make up the rules and require a redesign based on the new rules.  Also your electric company may not know how to interact with the local govt adding more confusion. 

My system was the first in my town with the local co-op, it was a huge pain to get them aligned, but well worth it 2yrs later.   

As others mentioned, get lots of quotes, ask for referrals, and push like a car dealer."
Thanks!
"Yes, I would.

Just about any company will tell you 4-6 month process.

Power companies have no benefit to speed up the process, so they drag their feet. 

As long as they start installing by Dec 31st I've read your good for the tax credit. If the inspection,  net meter and turning system on is after that it doesn't effect tax purpose."
"Yep, do it asap to at least get the ball rolling on this. A local company may be faster though if Tesla is busy since they can use other panel providers."
Their lower prices were finally competitive and their financing was better than what the few other local companies offered.
"It's a fairly standard Panasonic panel, 325 watts and co- branded with Solarcity. I do not believe they offer these anymore, as they've switched over to the Hanwha black back sheet 315w q-cells (or at least that's what they were using when I left in February). 

Previous to this, they also offered a black back sheet (ie, no silver) 315 watt Panasonic panel, which is what I have on my roof."
"I just asked my specialist for my proposed layout and they sent me the detailed drawing with all model numbers, details, etc. (4 or 5 pages PDF)

If you wanted it for reference/records,  you might be able to ask for the same thing if you didn't get it before.

I'm bummed as I found out my original install is only 235 watt panels. [5 years old]"
"This isn't true, they send a whole document with the specs of every piece of the puzzle. My panels are listed as ""The new Q.PEAK DUO BLK-G5 / SC solar module from Q CELLS impresses 
thanks to innovative Q.ANTUM DUO Technology,"" in the document I received in May. 

Side note, my power company has been the slower part of the process, Tesla has been outstanding."
"That is the next step. Right now we have no AC and oil heat in the Winter.

Our hot water is solar. Evacuated tube array.  Now, though, it would be cheaper to just put in more PV and heat the water with electricity."
We installed a heatpump in December. Water heater was new so that's further down on the list.
"Yup. They used my powerwalls down to 15% last evening to cover some load. But they won't touch them if it looks like there is any chance of me needing the backup (wind, snow or ice storm).

 It is a real win/win."
Well they designed them pretty damn good
I wonder how much more heat the skirts trap.
"Tesla giving me a referral code too! That's interesting as referring solar doesn't give any benefit, just buying the car which I don't have... yet....  [https://www.tesla.com/referral/robert31199](https://www.tesla.com/referral/robert31199)  is mine.. they need to do a solar referral program......."
Over how many years?
What does sleeper house mean? How did the etymology come about?
So are the computer chips you are using to post here. You can become Amish to avoid tech made with caustic chemicals.
This is after the Tesla price drop that they were 20-30% higher than all other installers. I quoted about 10 companies. My system is 10.6 kW with microinverters so similar in size too.
That's still not good.
"Thanks.. So, at least in warmer seasons, even without any batteries to store solar power in the house, if you charge your car twice a week in daytime and make around 350 400 km a week, you can run your car completely with solar energy, is this calculation correct?"
"25 bucks a month for a good, righteous feeling. I'd pay that."
Oh I have it all wrong then in my head I was assuming it was a lot more but what about money down?
"not that bad?

bruh what that would take an entire lifetime for me to get that much money"
"The side panel. Are there any other electronics involved? Energy monitor, etc?"
"Well, they go where the bathroom plumbing goes, so I'm assuming your bathrooms are on the back side of the house. Mine unfortunately are on the front"
"I love it, thanks for the info hope you enjoy!"
And your electric is offsetting much of that?
It’s terrible and I’m mad I never looked before. I have no idea if it’s feasible for me regardless but I sure as hell am contacting my rep soon to see what their stance on this is. It’s absurd.
"Unless he was calling his system by how much power it produces, but yeah doesn't help when the only difference is an h(r)."
Well F me running... very nice then :)
Is it a bunker?
Using the stored power doesn't save money with my rates so decided it wasn't worth it. And it's eligible still as long as I have panels I think
Well holy crap I didn't know about that. Now I've got to check with my tax person.
"Yeah, in the future if power rates have peak penalties here I may bite the bullet."
"How much is a ton? When powerwalls first came out, I heard they basically broke even, after you accounted for the cost of a new powerwall in 8-10 years. 

Which is still not a bad deal, considering you get the backup power function."
pix please
Best way to do it!
"Right, which I don't."
"Most power companies to not charge surge rates. The OP is right. Powerwall would not save money... just further reduce his need for outside power sources. 

I am in the same boat. Only real benefit for a powerwall to me would be if a hurricane came through. I could charge it with our generator and it could handle the power spikes from the AC. Right now I have to rely on a capacitor."
Tesla/Panasonic
Grid-tied
"If you're lucky enough to get them,  the install time is long too. ( That's what Tesla is working on).

Some articles show 3 weeks of installing the tiles alone."
"So you think Tesla is overstaffed, because you personally don't know what each person does. Okay."
"> But Tesla's finance program is the best we've seen. They assume you will roll the 30% tax credit into your bill so they start billing you the smaller amount right away.

can you explain this a little further? does that mean they bill you the monthly after the tax credit essentially fronting you that?"
That’s not bad. I started the process the day the model 3 was announced. (End of March I think?). Got it installed and running in December (not Tesla).
"As a counterpoint, I don't think my system setup could have gone faster (NY metro). I reached out 2nd week of January online, had my entire system up and running by mid March. 8kW + 2 powerwalls. Some of the initial delays were on me - scheduling the initial consult, the site walkthrough, follow up, took the first 3 weeks of that. It almost felt TOO fast."
"If you use EnergySage, just be prepared for the barrage of emails, phone calls, and any other forms of communication possible.

I've called and emailed multiple times trying to get it to stop."
"Yeah, they didn't tell me if there were other options"
Why aren't they using Tesla panels from GF2?
"Actually, looking at the paperwork again,  you are right. ""SolarCity Standard: SC330"" so Panasonic sc330 panels.

The SolarCity standard part threw me off since these are not the standard panels."
Interesting. I didn’t realize they drew off the power walls. I’m with Washington electric coop. I m getting my quote from Tesla for 8kw system but I couldn’t see the cost justification for the power wall.  I’m also a model 3 owner.  Any reason I should get in your opinion?
"The installers, who aren't Tesla, said they were overengineered lol like pressing 3 buttons to flip a light switch. Took way longer to install because of that, But they did compliment how it turned out."
"Not sure, but there are gaps."
They were doing 5 years of extra warranty if you used someone's code.
"They offer 10 and 20. We did 20, but the plan is to pay it much sooner than that."
Over 1 year if you want. Years doesn't change  cost sans interest. I chose 20 years so my power cost doesn't change from my existing payments.
"Kinda like a sleeper car. ""A sleeper (US English) or Q-car (British English) is a car that has high performance and an unassuming exterior. Sleeper cars are so called because their exterior looks similar or identical to a standard or economy-class car."" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_(car)"
I was gonna ask.
"See I’m not concerned with that. I embrace that that’s the world we live in AND that we can be better. What I don’t do is give myself an undeserved pat on the back for something just because it displaces the environmental cost to another place around the globe or other sector of industry. The ability of this generation to polarize every issue into something black and white is definitely a sad thing... Holding two opposing opposites to be true, recognizing faults, and striving to be better is an important part of adult psychology. Blind idealism only creates blind opposition.

Everyone’s defensive bias regarding the truth about the current environmental state of lithium causes them to read everything as an attack. It’s a positive thing though, as it shows people want to care about the environment... but they get super fucking pissed when you expand their bubble beyond the scope of a simple personal decision into a dynamic global manufacturing ecosystem."
"Ah, well good for you then. :) 

The company that installed the panels for Tesla had given us a quote too, $26K for 9.6KW. Looks like it really depends on your area and number of local installers."
"As a straight investment, sure. But I am still adding value to the home too. Should generate ~$50k in it's lifetime at least, plus the home value."
"Well I get close to 4 miles to a kwh, so that's like 40k miles a year or 64k km. So well over 1000 km per week in the summer, and around 300 or so in the winter.

We'll see how the system performs though 😀 all estimates at this point."
$0
I mean this is like half my Model 3 lol. There are loans for these things.
I'll have to see about getting a picture of that. Not technically running yet since we are waiting on the city and then the power company to do inspections.
"Mid to back, yep. 

You can get a checkerboard pattern of panels and set a new trend :)"
"Their estimates are like 10k kwh a year, which for me would be around $100 a month. If you get more sun or pay more for power, your number would increase"
Possible that your particular power generation mix isn't flexible so if everyone started producing power it would be bad.
"Thanks! Basements aren't taxed so saves us money, and more efficient to heat since we technically live upstairs. A bear to cool though..."
"Yeah, but WhoTF cares anyway?"
Daylight basement. Very useful if we decide to rent out the bottom half down the road.
"If you add it to panels, yes, if you later add panels to a panelless Powerwall setup, no."
"I asked our solar installers a few months ago and they said battery storage was not eligible for the tax credit. (We were asking about it as they were quoting the solar panel install, so it would have been all installed at once)"
"Of the bill or the setup? The billing is not something I handle, but I will be happy to share the Tesla trifecta when I get home in a new post, just to not hijack theirs."
"Then they are not running their Tesla on the sun.

They are running it mostly on grid power with a bit of sun."
"Yup, Musk himself said they have way too many employees a while back. Productivity per person is fairly low.

Ford has 199,000 employees and sells about 6.6 million cars/yr.. That would mean Tesla would have to sell about 1.5 million cars with current number of employees to match them. Similar story with General Motors."
"Yep, pretty much. You have 18 months to add the rebate money or the payment will revert to the full amount. Most banks will let you reamortize once, but none we saw let you start your payments assuming you will reamortize. If you pay less or more, it will adjust your payment at month 19 accordingly."
"Yeah, in the winter I'm sure getting solar is a breeze :)"
"It's email only,  your phone number isn't passed along (maybe not even collected).  I didn't experience a barrage, only the quotes and a few followups."
I never got any calls or unwarranted emails. I put this in my communication preferences before requesting quotes
"The cost was actually the same, it was purely an anesthetic and minor power difference. Tesla solar is cagey about discussing hardware, but they use good stuff."
""" fairly standard Panasonic panel, 325 watts and co- branded with Solarcity "". they are assembled in GF2."
"They probably are. Here's an article that might describe the GF2 setup a little better.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/electrek.co/2019/05/15/tesla-gigafactory-2-panasonic-solar-companies/amp/

Summary: The Tesla space is used by Panasonic and and the components they make there are sold to anyone, even Tesla competitors."
Yeah it's definitely word vomit lol.
"Utilities don't normally draw off them. You have full use of the so you can run battery overnight and even last through outages.

My utility heavily subsidized them (I paid just $1500 each installed).  They draw power out during high demand to reduce their dependence on high-cost high demand sources. I dont know of any other utility that does that. They say it saved them $500,000 last year and they are expanding the program.

If you don't need battery backup often, and you can get a decent net metering deal with the utility, I dont think there is a strong case for the powerwalls at the current price."
"PS: I'm in rural Vermont and we lose power for up to 12 hours at a time with every major storm, so the backup power thing for me is a game changer.

If the Sun keeps charging them during the day, I can stay powered up forever. 2 powerwalls are 20Kw, and I only use about 1/2 that per day."
"If it's worth doing, it's worth over doing!
-Tesla (probably)"
I think they also (supposedly?) serve as a deterrent for some nesting birbs to set up shop underneath.
Wow really? Is that still a thing? Doesn't seem so
"Basically what we did too, though hope to put a bigger dent before the reamortization happens so we are already in the positive."
That's what I'm interested in. I pay about $150 to $250 a month depending on the season right now and I'd like it to stay around there. Buying a much newer an efficient house hopefully this month and I'm interested in upgrading.
"Wow, that's interesting. Over here in the UK, we would say ""Tardis-like"" with reference to the Dr Who TV series - where this guy lives and travels in an unassuming police box (a phone booth for you guys) which is actually much bigger on the inside than observable from the outside  (defying the laws of scientific convention) with highly advanced technology inside.

Never heard of Q-car by the way"
"How many bedrooms, if you don't mind me asking?"
"It is treated as an attack because your claim of environmental destruction of solar panel / Li battery manufacturing is very likely overblown. There are numerous studies over the years that show that solar panels pay back the co2 that was emitted making/installing them in 2 - 4 years. Claim of caustic chemicals = bad, without explaining the issues in their usage cycle when making panels makes you sound like one of those ""chemicals = bad, organic = good"" non scientific types."
" Can I pm you some questions about the system? 

That's about the exact size I need and I'm wasting all this Central Florida sun power!"
Oh nice! Can't even tell from this angle!
Good to know. By the time we add it anyways there won't be an incentive 😉 going to be a few years
"Your installer may not have known.

According to Tesla, they count. Essentially your total bill for the installation would be eligible for the 30% tax credit so long as it's all done at once. Installing a battery later wouldn't.

[https://imgur.com/a/kkxi2zA](https://imgur.com/a/kkxi2zA)"
"During the day, the panels feed the grid, at night the car grabs power off of the grid.  The panels are powering the neighbors during peak need and pulling power during the off-peak.   It's even better than hoarding in a PW."
"Comments like these always get downvoted, and I've yet to get a good explanation as to why. As far as I can figure, you are absolutely right. The car is essentially being powered by the grid. The solar is feeding the grid and making it ever so slightly cleaner, which is great.  But the charging of the car and solar feeding the grid are completely independent...one does not affect the other. Anyone have a better explanation?"
"Ford’s business at this moment is to slightly change their assembly lines to fit a new shape of stoplights for next year’s models. 

I can see why they need less people per car sold. 

Wanting to streamline is always good. But efficiency is also the enemy of flexibility and innovation. So while I’m sure Musk is thinking of ways of streamlining his operation, which is mostly brand new, I wouldn’t also compare them to Ford."
"This is actually incorrect. Most of the solar finance companies has that as the default payment structure, either 16 or 18 months."
"I've always heard a solar installation can be a pain, but I hope that didn't hurt too much :)"
"Found out at least the paperwork says they should be SC330's, so 330 watt panels."
"Correct. These are gigafactory 2 panels, but there isn't anything unique about them. They're just off the shelf Panasonic components."
"Thanks for weighing in. That was my thought also.  My utility company is really good. I live very rurally also, in Plainfield. Power only goes out a couple times a year with storms
And they almost always get it back on within hours, probably because I live off of one of the main arteries. They’re even carbon neutral, generating all their power with hydro and methane recovery, and net metering solar.   Only drawback is they are very expensive... hence my interest in owning a pv system.   

Where are you?  (So I know which model 3 to wave at next time I’m in the area. )"
"Makes sense. If I smell chicken, I'll know where to look."
"This. Soon after installing my panels (SolarEdge), we had pigeons move in under the panels. Made a real mess of things. I ended up having to install a net around the whole system. The Tesla skirts look MUCH nicer."
"They kind of do deter pets, but not that well.   In heavy critter areas it's still recommended to install critter guard.  There is no skirt on the top of the system.  There is trapped heat, somewhere between a 12 to 30% increase in latent heat under the panels, but people love the aesthetics.

&#x200B;

Source: Worked on the design team."
"No, they stopped that before they lowered their prices"
I'm paying that with 2 power walls and solar. Can't beat that imo
We too also watch the Who.
5 plus an office.
"Don’t be so simple. Yes solar panels are a good investment, though I’d be curious to those reports on the disposal of them since they are never recycled...

Anyways. It’s not all about co2... It’s also about the communities and ecosystems (the natural kind) that are affected through caustic resource extraction. 500,000 gallons of water for every ton of lithium is a very real figure. The communities/water-sources/life cycles of animals affected by this are very real and likely underreported considering the countries these things take place in. I mean would you feel comfortable with lithium extraction next to your home? Would you feel safe drinking your water? 

Also, what are most lithium batteries charged by? Nuclear plants? Solar farms? Nope... and due to our shit electric grid less than 40% of the energy made in power plants makes its way to the lithium batteries. 

My comments stands about people being unwilling to consider themselves part of a dynamic ecosystem (not the natural kind). There all multiple ways that making advanced technology ripples through our lives and the world. Co2 is just one measure of that. 

I’m not saying anyone right or wrong. Just be aware of the cost associated and have a healthy skepticism. Don’t just buy into social responsible marketing because it makes you feel good about where the world is headed."
"Sure, though depending on what you need it may be better to contact Tesla's solar sales team."
Very nice since you don't pay taxes on basements 😁
Why turn down free money? These aren't cheap
Oh! Unused units are sold back. My confusion is abated.
That still is not being powered by the sun though like the title states.
Because the panels produce most/all of my electricity needs in the time they run. So I'm basically using the grid as storage.
"Because you are offsetting your use.  While you are not directly charging your car with that electricity there is a benefit to this.   All grids are different but if you live somewhere where the highest electrical demand is during the summer on the hottest days of the year then there is an overall benefit to having grid tied solar as it will produce during those peak times.   So if your grid uses natural gas peaker plants to supply the electricity during those demands any grid tied solar will offset some of that.    

In some cases it may actually be better to not charge from your solar and instead supply the grid.   Where I live (Ontario, Canada) the grid's baseload generation is nuclear and hydro.     So that means on average if there were no natural gas peaker plants running then the CO2 per kWh for the baseload generation would actually be lower then solar.   IPCC has Hydro and Nuclear at 24 and 12 grams of CO2 per kWh.   Rooftop solar is 41 grams of CO2.   So it is far more beneficial (from a CO2 point of view) for the solar to feed the grid during peak hours when natural gas generation would be running (NG is 490 grams of CO2 per kWh) then to use that power to charge the car at that time.   Then if I set the car to charge in the middle of the night little of the NG will still be running.   So if offsetting carbon is a motivator then in my case a grid tied system is best solution where I then charge my car off the grid in the middle of the night.   Doing that will result in the actual greatest reduction in CO2 emissions."
"Cool, then you have seen better providers. The ones the local companies worked with all let you reamortize, but the payment was not prelowered in expectation that you would add rebate funds."
"Gotcha. Basically the same panels then with a slight wattage boost. They're good panels, you'll be happy with them for decades to come."
"Putney Vt. Blue LR AWD :)

If you're ever this way you're welcome to a charge and tour of the system..."
Damn. Makes sense tho. I'll take the savings. Thanks!
Impressive. Truly a sleeper.
"There is no reason solar panels cannot be stripped of aluminum frames and wires and be stockpiled in a landfill. Not everything has to be recycled. Your desire to recycle comes from ideological pov, not rational. The water use you quoted for lithium extraction sounds like bullshit."
"Exactly. Not cheap, provide me little benefit. So saving money on it is kinda like saving money on a third car."
Discounts are not free money. You literally have to pay to take advantage.
"Yep!   The homeowner gets the credit, and the energy is immediately used nearby, which reduces the amount if energy lost in transport.   And obviously, it's one less battery getting worn out."
Where I am the grid is pretty clean but on the hottest days of the summer in mid to late day the grid is going to need the most generation capacity.   That will typically be natural gas peaker plants (the dirtiest generation method on our grid).   If you have grid tied solar then anything you produce during the day will offset some of that.   Meanwhile if I charge in the middle of the night the grid will be the cleanest it is because most of that natural gas generation will be offline and it will just need the baseload generation (nuclear and hydro).  This means that if you use IPCCs numbers then my EV will actually produce less CO2 doing this then if charged directly from solar.    So while you aren't directly powering from solar there is an overall benefit that will actually be better then charging from solar in some cases.   Also if you live at a more northern latitude then charging only from solar wouldn't even be possible since you will make relatively little electricity in the winter months.   With my solar system i make more electricity that I use in a year but the vast majority of that is made in the summer months compared to the winter.
"You are right, actually.. it's a good point. Same thing as carbon credits. You're selling someone clean power, but you're still relying on dirty power yourself. The total amount of dirty power has not necessarily gone down by much. 

What is the net effect on pollution in the whole system?"
"I replied to another answer next to yours with some further thoughts.  I certainly don't want to take anything away from your solar/EV efforts...it's a great thing you have done to help supply clean electricity and efficient transportation!  I'm rather jealous of the setup haha...but it seems to me with a grid tied system, your electricity usage and your electricity generation are not really related.  Solar power goes into the grid whether you use it or not."
"No, you are not using the grid as storage.

You are using the grid to offset your cost of charging your car. You are still taking power from the grid and its dirty sources for the majority of your charging if you charge overnight.

It simply isn't true that your car is running on the sun. Why purposefully try to mislead people?"
"You are not really offsetting your use with a grid-tied system though are you? You are supplying the grid a certain amount of solar power...whether YOU use it or not.

&#x200B;

If your solar array produced 50kwh in a day that's going into the grid no matter what.  Doesn't matter if you put 0kwh or 50kwh in your Tesla.

&#x200B;

I completely agree that a grid tied system is generally the best way to reduce CO2 emissions, and it is a great thing for OP and others to do.   But I am not yet convinced you can say your EV is being ""charged by the sun"" from a grid tied system. The act of charging your car is not related to the act of supplying solar power to the grid.  Sorry if I'm just dense haha...but the only explanation that makes sense to me is:

&#x200B;

1. Solar array supplies grid clean power.  This for all intents and purposes, is equally distributed among all users tied to the grid.  Has no direct impact on how clean YOUR electricity use is.
2. EV charges from the grid. For all intents and purposes, it is being powered by whatever the grid mix is.  The grid happens to be a little cleaner due to your solar array, but the two are otherwise unrelated."
"I mean... it's literally most of the bigger financiers... Mosaic, Sunlight, Sungage, Dividend, LoanPal, etc. They all do..."
"Since they dragged their feet so much with mine, I'm the unicorn with both 😁"
"Wow you really are willing to be completely blind of the actual process that goes on in making your batteries...  these are extremely weak points and are straying from the topic at hand. I don’t have a desire to recycle... it’s just a point about the environmental impact. You’re starting to argue against a straw man and it’s just proving my point about people’s unwillingness to separate from the feel-good marketing that the electric car industry has instilled in people.

The extraction process is called brine mining. They jet extremely large quantities of water into the ground in an effort to dissolve the minerals, which can then be moved easily up from the earth where the water can evaporate.

The numbers I’ve gotten are 500,000 gallons per ton of lithium and 50,000 liters per day for specifically the San Cristobál Mine in Bolivia— as of 2010. So we’re basically talking 5,000,000 gallons of water per year at one mine almost 10 years ago. So we’re obviously talking much much larger now since Bolivia has the world’s largest deposits of lithium. and this is just one mine out of many on Bolivian salt flats. The number I quoted, unfortunately is beyond your belief, but just because you can’t comprehend the impact of what goes into your batteries doesn’t mean it’s not happening.

It makes me sad that you doubt my figures for literally no reason. I’m not trying to make you feel bad. Just see the facts so people can know what’s going on and then we can promote an overall more sustainable world instead of just pretending that it doesn’t exist because our communities aren’t affected.

And we didn’t even talk about the lithium in Australia that is dug up in rocks and sent to China, the world’s largest consumer of coal power, to be processed and distributed around the globe... 

bye for now I know you won’t be answering after this. Hopefully you read and get informed about the topic.

Some reading for you:

"If you're going to pay anyway, guess what, 30% less is a lot of free money. If you're on the fence, maybe not. I'm getting battery storage no matter what."
"So the title is still a blatant lie.

The car is not being charged by the sun. It is being charged mostly by the grid at night and the owner is offsetting the cost by selling electricity.

This kind of shell game is not helping nearly as much as people think it is."
This would still be less if at least *some* of the charging is done during daylight hours.
"I mean, it's pretty much like the grid is a giant battery. Any extra I make during the day goes to the grid and I pull from the grid at night. The difference is I am storing power at a hydro plant instead of outside my house."
"That's like saying you aren't running your EV on electricity, you are running it on Coal/oil/hydro/etc."
"Ok then, Tesla offset by the sun.

Tesla still (currently) requires dirty power to charge at night time in most places.

If it's a 100% even swap (or better), then I'm not really sure how much it makes a difference, but it's true that the demand for dirty power still exists. The power plants that continue to run at night are the higher efficiency ones, and they are rarely shut off. (But IMHO, besides charging/heating, almost zero power should be consumed late at night anyway.)

This is sort of an ethical question; if you can't manage to get your power company to convert to renewable energy, is it actually enough just to grid-tie? Or should you reduce your consumption and/or buy battery backups?"
Wtf? Why are these comments getting down voted.
"> The numbers I’ve gotten are 500,000 gallons per ton of lithium and 50,000 liters per day for specifically the San Cristobál Mine in Bolivia— as of 2010

I am looking for a source of this claim. About San Cristóbal mine (Bolivia), so far I got ""The mine’s immense water use (50,000 liters per day) threatens the natural and human future of the region."" From ""A Democracy Center Special Report. Bolivia and its
Lithium. Can the “Gold of the 21st Century” Help Lift a
Nation out of Poverty? by Rebecca Hollender and Jim Shultz May 2010 page 44. 

The obvious problem is that the mine produces not lithium but: ""produces approximately 1,300 metric tons of zinc-silver concentrate and 300 tons of lead-silver concentrate per day, as of August 2010,[1] by processing 40,000 to 50,000 tons of rock"". Looks like that water usage stat does not apply to lithium production.

So go ahead, help me out find the true fresh water usage of salt brine lithium mines. For now I will stand by my claim that the numbers you quote are bullshit."

Return on investment is why. In some states only part of it nets you a return and none of it nets you a return if you’re not in your forever home.
"But if you dont need it now, battery prices will probably fall between now and the time you buy it and you dont have the opportunity cost of shelling out several thousand dollars now or the finance cost of borrowing it. Batteries make little sense for most people, if you want backup power it would be cheaper to buy and operate a standby whole house generator."
"Not just offsetting cost but also co2 emissions. Feed solar power back to grid = upstream power plant burns less nat gas = co2 saved. Then use night time power to charge the car and emit that saved co2. 
This only works if marginal generator on the grid is fossil fuel powered during your solar export period. If there is too much utility solar generarion and it is being curtailed due to grid oversupply, then your home solar does not offset co2. Thats when battery storage is needed."
"That is what you are doing and using the money you make from selling power to subsidize the dirty power you are buying.

Again, why purposefully mislead people by saying you run on the sun when you really charge from the grid?"

"Fine keep focusing on the micro points while the macro just flies wayyy over your head. you keep searching for little little “victories” without even taking one sentence to actually acknowledge that there *is* in fact an impact here that won’t be good for the ecosystem. I’ll keep searching and you keep your head up your ass. These countries need to contend with major water issues as more and more lithium comes into a region already operating mines that use up to the limit that the ecosystems can handle. The numbers just give us a barometer to set our views on for concrete conceptualization. However I’m sure in the research you’ve done you come across the obvious concern is that these issues present an environmental challenge. No source you find about brine manufacturing will tell you anything less than large quantities of water are necessary to extract the lithium. And using a extremely large amounts of water in a desert area to extract minerals that are then left out in the open to dry isn’t exactly the best thing for an area... if you take anything away from this just take that common sense.

And still we haven’t even addressed Chinese coal power and infrastructure processing Australian lithium out of rocks or the byproducts in the brine evaporation and how companies will handle that waste. Because we both know 3rd world mining companies follow the most stringent of environmental policies. Especially as the biggest rush for resources takes place since we found oil.

Again, you can get defensive and hold fast in your defensiveness, continuing to feel good about yourself that you’ve made some minor point like doubting Amit Katwala’s article reporting on the consumption of water in a lithium brine plant, or you can start to accept the ripple that battery consumption and production puts throughout the environment. 

I’m not saying it’s not still going to be a net gain for the environment of the globe. Just be aware of what’s going on. And maybe work on argument assassination that actually focuses on the argument at hand when you try to debate. That silly stuff might work in politics, but we’re not trying to the win the primaries here."
💀 💀
"Financing is a sensible thing for some people considering battery storage and it can reduce the monthly expenses, saving you money. It's often such a savings the finance charges come out in the wash. That's why I bought a financed used Tesla in the first place and contacted Tesla energy for solar yesterday, planning to finance two systems and two powerwalls."
"Either way, the title is still intentionally misleading."
Because energy is neither created or destroyed.
Got it
See this is why i dont take your kind of people seriously. You operate on emotions fueled by bad data. All i ask for you is to find the source of your claim that lithium brine mining uses that much water as you claim. You dont seem to be able. Probably because that number has no basis in reality.
you have your head too far up elons ass
"You are lying to people because of the conservation of energy?

That makes no sense."
"Yes ignore the multiple sources describing the issues that water usage is an issue. Who cares what the number is? If they used a drop of water and it harms a community/ecosystem vs an ocean of water and it harms a community/ecosystem what does that matter? You’re focusing on something you can critique rather than seeing the larger picture. I swear if I told you a fire was 1,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit, you’d still stick your hand in it, citing the fact that it’s impossible for it to be that hot.

You can already view multiple sources on the issues surrounding the privatization in Bolivia, referred to as “the water wars” in the 2000s and those issues still persist. The region is a desert and you can easily find meany sources lamenting the impact that the mining has. Your focus on the amount of gallons it uses, as if you personally will assess the environmental impact based on that number is hysterically myopic.... so here more reading for you.

“In Chilean desert, global thirst for lithium is fueling a 'water war'”

“A water fight in Chile's Atacama raises questions over lithium mining”
https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1MS1L8

I can’t respect this view that isn’t fueled by literally any data except the assumption that an absence of evidence is the evidence of absence... regardless of the fact that there is is actual evidence... just not a specific number that you doubt from wired, even though we already know that ANY brine mining uses vast quantities of water.

And we still haven’t touched on China, the world’s largest coal powered industrial nation."
"> even though we already know that ANY brine mining uses vast quantities of water

How do you know that ?"
"I swear if I told you my faucet wasn’t running you’d still question whether or not I was out of water just because I couldn’t tell you specifically how many gallons were not flowing... there’s other ways to identify a problem than with hard data. But, to satisfy your unhealthy craving for numbers:

They are extracting 10s of thousands of metric tons of lithium brine (a solution comprised of WATER and varying portions of salts) per year per mine of which we learned in today’s assigned reading is [1,700 liters](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05233-7) per second for the Salar de Atacama. Let’s convert and call it 448 gallons/s. There are 31.5 million seconds in a year so that’s 15.7 billion gallons of brine. We can learn from this well sourced [document](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/43801293/Uyuni_brine_paper_2012.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DRecovery_of_lithium_from_Uyuni_salar_bri.pdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A%2F20190703%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20190703T195010Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=17d920100b2a80482a483fc0399d1709168cdfa15cf032c3ec7a544d1f2d1d23), that the non water portion of brine in the, Salar de Atacama, Chile, is a 33.2% aggregate of Calcium, Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium, Lithium, Boron, and Strontium. We also know that brine is a solution of salts and water, 66.8% water in this case. 66.8%*15.7billion= 10.5 billion gallons of water or in scientific terms “1 Vast Quantity.” we can also extrapolate from the data that each mine contains a majority portion of water in comparison to the other materials that comprise the brine solution. And this is more often than not in ecosystems consistently described as arid and fragile. We also know that these numbers have been growing rapidly along with the expansion of the electric car and other battery intense industries.

Oh and every goddamn report talks about how the mining is damaging the ecosystem if you really didn’t read anything I sent you. Literally every source describing the extraction of lithium in brine as it relates to the environment highlights the issue of water. If a few mining companies can disrupt the water in a localized area, the process isn’t quite a small one is it? Peer reviewed scientific studies and journalistic articles stating “water polluted by lithium extraction,” “putting human health at risk,” “government to further limit water use,” “(mining company) sucked up... more than its permits allowed,” and “water war” are some key highlights that don’t exactly paint a rosy picture that requires numbers to interpret.

So yeah, that’s how I know that. Goodbye 👋"
"I read your reports, there is nothing in there about how mining is damaging ecosystem but lots of how it may or could.  Fear mongering basically. The brine they extracting from under the lakes has a lot of water in it but that water is not usable fresh water, it is salty brine water. How is that water of any use for the farmers ?"
"Look we can debate all day but please don’t flat out lie to me and say you have read the stuff when you haven’t. Additionally, don’t rely on your own interpretation of what groundwater is used for. Just because you misunderstand how groundwater around salt lakes works doesn’t mean it isn’t used for irrigation, which it is. Also, groundwater is connected and as you know from biology, a high concentration flows into a low concentration of water. 

“A Chilean parliamentary commission has acknowledged that overexploitation of groundwater resources has damaged ecosystems in the Salar de Atacama basin...” 

HAS damaged. 

I’ll give you a pass on naivety for irrigation as it feels like common sense that salt lakes aren’t used for irrigation, but the groundwater they store does make its way to farming. 

“...Sometimes, they have obtained these rights through the payment of compensation to local commu- nities, for damages caused to wetlands and salt lakes that are used for irrigation and grassland purposes.” - https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/env.2011.0017 

Damages CAUSED. Salt lakes... USED for irrigation.

I took a goddamn course on the social issues of environmental geography with a focus on South America dude. I can’t believe I’m accused of bullshit data, while you try to claim these sources of water aren’t used for irrigation or that ecological damage hasn’t already occurred with literally zero knowledge of the topic other than what popped into your mind. People have literally died in Bolivia fighting over water... water and it’s privatization is a major fucking issue in the region. 

Please run along now this is getting ridiculous."
Your claim of 50k gal of water per day for lithium production had no source in the paper it came from written 10 years ago. I will accuse you of peddling bullshit all i want. There is no evidence that pulling unusable salty brine water from under dead lakes in the desert can remove fresh water from farmers (farming in the desert? Really?). Keep trying.
"Omg lmao you have obviously studied zero ecology, hydrogeology, and geography. ”No evidence” ... really dude? You’re all of a sudden an expert?

Let me break it down for you. Theres a few things going on here hydro-geologically. Salt lakes can be located in what is referred to as “highlands.” The groundwater that is stored in the highlands eventually makes its way down to what is referred to as “lowlands.” Additionally, ground aquifers are connected and water moves through, or can be irrigated to, specific areas... yes even from salt lakes- an important source of water in an arid area. As the water flows through the ground away from salty deposits the minerals are filtered by the soil by the time they are able to make it to the lowlands or simply as the water moves through its aquifer away from the saltwater source through earth that is not salt rich. Additionally, as the % of saltwater reduces and as it meets freshwater, it begins to naturally descend under the saline free water due it’s greater density. 

A quick breakdown of salt lakes is as follows:  “Large saline lakes represent 44% of the volume and 23% of the area of all lakes on Earth1. Saline lakes are located in mostly arid, endorheic basins and are diverse... Increasing water use by humans, especially for agricultural irrigation3, is a significant factor in (saline) lake desiccation”

ESPECIALLY for agricultural irrigation...

https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_journals/2017/rmrs_2017_wurtsbaugh_w001.pdf

 “lowlands depend exclusively on water stored in freshwater and salt lakes and wetlands, which are essential for the conservation of nature and society, especially as they feed ground aquifers.”

FEED GROUND AQUIFERS.

“Many desert areas have limestone hills or mountains within them or close to them that can be exploited as groundwater resources.”

Ugh this is getting ridiculous...

Civilization has existed specifically in the Atacama region for over 10,000 years.... so yeah. They farm there. And this isn’t the only region we’re talking about that uses salt lakes as a groundwater source.

Goddamn dude what are you on? You’ve done zero research. Like seriously... stop calling my actually knowledge on the topic bullshit when you so confidently declare outright lies as truth. You’re just making shit up on the fly because it sounds good in your head lmao.

This is really emblematic of my assertion that electric car fans are incredibly myopic in their views as you can’t even conceptualize how ecosystems and different bordering biomes are connected. Worse, you’ve resorted to expressing your made opinions as ecological knowledge. At least I citing *something* that we can assume was researched to some degree."
Yeah thought so.
"Nah, don't have time to be reading into this right now.  But i will remember this issue into the future."
Very cool.  Gongrats to you all!  May the sun move you forward!
Nice shirt!
Now.... if we could just use our Teslas as powerwalls....
Awesome! If you had to charge your car from the battery packs what percentage would it give you on your car before they were drained?
"Congrats.
I too have Power Wall and 40 pv panels.
Best thing we ever did."
100% jealous. This is my dream.
"OP check into SGIP as well. you might get up to $1500 back for the powerwalls from PG&E or SCE depending on where you are at  [https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/sgip/](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/sgip/)depending utility there might still be funding avail  [https://www.selfgenca.com/home/program\_metrics/](https://www.selfgenca.com/home/program_metrics/)

All of the funding has rolled out so make sure to ask and get your name in. I called Tesla and they added me on for the 2018 and i got the full 1500 (resident 10kw and under.) you have to keep your powerwall set to load shift or Self powered to qualify (which for most people is fine) if  you are using it set to backup only you dont qual. and Tesla knows what its set to.

you can also call the utility and go through them if they allow it, as Tesla and LG and others are only given a set Funding amount. but if you go through the paperwork you can still get the credit by submitting yourself. This requires Tesla to provide some information. but so far 2 people I know of have been able to get the info required for SCE to Submit."

[deleted]
"Awesome!

Assuming you’re USA, question about the ICT (aka 30% tax credit): Are you able to force charge your Powerwalls from the grid too since you presumably can’t claim them on the ICT as they were installed after solar?

I had wondered if anybody ever did the reverse and got Powerwall for TOU shifting, later adding solar, and being able to mix and match how you charge them? Sort of a best of both worlds situation."
Love it! Congrats
"Can you use power walls without solar?

Like, could I use them to store energy during lower cost parts of the day to use at higher cost parts of the night?"

"Nice!! Also on phase 3 (Model X75D, 5kW solar, 3x powerwalls).  Might need phase 4 to increase # of solar panels, especially if there’s to be a phase 5 of Tesla #2.  It never ends!"
Nice
Beautiful

"Question to all you powerwall owners:   Do they prevent 'flickers'.   My grid is reliable, but tends to go out for 2-5 seconds multiple times a month.    Would a powerwall alleviate this?"
Dayummmmmm. You got a Reddit shirt?!
How do these things work in a grid tied system?
Congrats on staying the course and keeping to the Tesla plan.  Always nice to get all the pieces to fall into place
I have a question for you OP. Are you able to get paid for providing a surplus of energy back to the grid? If so is that even profitable to help pay off your setup or does it not work that way?
The dream. Great setup !
"How much power do your panels generate at peak? I have two Powerwalls and 5.8 kWh generation capacity (which, realistically speaking, has never exceeded 5.1, and typically averages 4-4.5 over the course of a summer), and I can typically generate enough to power the house and send some back to the grid, but I definitely can't generate enough to offset the usage of my Model S."
Literal goals! Lol
I have a model S and I drive around 100 miles per day. My energy bill with AC is around $90/month.  Do you believe 2 solars from Tesla + 2 Powerwalls will be enough ?
What do you do for a living and how can I do it?
It probably provides a healthy boost to OP's property values though. I'm sure this would help when holistically looking at the cost of the system
Beautiful set up! Glad you’re enjoying everything.
And he has a Reddit shirt? Wow. Living your best life man! Congratulations!
Is it a forgone conclusion that you went with the Tesla solar tiles? You should give us a 6 month update about how thing go
He even wore his Reddit t-shirt for the photo.
I envy You.
"Love the discreet Reddit.  :)

Also congrats! Just recently got my Model 3, I am in love. Solar is next on the agenda. You are who I want to be"

"Hey, i was wondering if you could power your home when the mains go out. could you try this? turning off the main switch going to the grid?

i wonder if the box is able to create the sine wave without a reference."
"Cool, I pick up my Model 3 on Sunday and get solar installed on Tuesday 😁"
Damn you guys are loaded
"That’s cool and all but it would take me over 10 years to recoup the cost of that, mine is showing for 2 power walls it will be around 14-16k.
Just a bit too much at this time to even consider. I will likely move before I ever come close to getting my moneys worth. Fyi that’s 14-16k before I even start getting quotes for the solar panels so once that comes we are prolly talking 15-20 years before recouping costs. 

Electricity is quite cheap here in Houston, I pay around 5-9 cents per kWh at any given time."
Can someone please explain this concept to me?
Just here to say that an M3 is a totally different car ;)
"Awesome! We currently have a M3- but had our 1st Powerwall installed (no solar) 6 months ago! It’s made quite the difference, even without the solar panels."
"Hmm, you don't have the solar-panel roof shingles?

There are 4 phases you filthy amateurs."
What's your electric bill now
I noticed the hardhat on the wall. Is he an architect or engineer?
Does it take three years to take possession after reservation?
How are the power walls going? Do you produce enough during the day to fully charge them?
Question: Are you able to apply for the tax credit on the new additions to your system (i.e. expanding your renewable energy system)?
916? Sacramento? Congrats to you all! I'm 23 right now and can't wait to buy a Tesla in the future when I am financially stable :D!
"Do you need 2 just for the car itself or does it do other things for your house as well?

It seemed like 1 pack could do quite a bit."
"God, I wish I could afford all that :("
If only...
What is a powerwall?
Who’d you buy the solar panels from?
So are you completely off grid now? I know the power walls can run the home for a long period. Just wondering was definitely thinking about doing that. This is amazing by the way!

"Curious how much you spent on the solar and PW, and what the payback period is going to be."
2000ms start up time and 1500ms delivery time are the stated values for a brand new Powerwall.  That’s 3.5 seconds for a brand new battery.

*Gripe about Tesla's power wall installs:*

for a tech company that installs these Daily that is sure an Ugly install compared to: [this](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/img_0163.jpg?w=1390&crop=1)

in fact they do installs like this so its not its a ""artist rendering"" [Actual install](https://www.anapode.com/images/product_images/Powerwall2/Powerwall2.jpg)

when in fact this is what you really get: [from Tesla](https://cleantechnica.com/files/2019/01/tesla-powerwall-installation-layout-essential-loads.png)

for Being ""the apple of cars."" this sure does not seem integrated very well....why is the relay not part of the unit? how come you cant use my built in box and feed the powerwall with its own 100 amp breaker and relay.

flow = Main power disconnect < relay < powerwall + solar inverter.and/or get rid of that relay box. its needed anyways, why not integrate it into the powerwall?"
It’s so awesome to know that my car drives on sunshine☀️
Thanks! (husband here)
"then you supercharge up the Car at a Lower rate.  and back feed it into the grid to make money. so no utility is going to allow it. as they don't allow this now because  they will lose money

not gonna happen from a OEM. perhaps as a Mod. but not OEM. you will have Wear to battery but no Miles on the OD which is a way to gauge use.  this means the Warranty extends LONG past the Actual usage of the pack

Pack could be down to 50% life because its been used as a home storage or some other way, such as Load shifting, or remote heavy power use cases.

if something happens Tesla now has a Pack with low miles that's dead and they are under warranty to replace it."
"\^\^ This.  In Australia, the Newer Nissan Leaf are able to be used as a Power Wall, kind of."
"Exactly this, and would also love a “Matrix 2” means of one Tesla charging another."
"Ours Mode 3 is a Long Range Dual Motor so it’s approx. a 75kWh battery. 

Each Powerwall has 13.5 kWH of storage x2 = 27kWh of backup/day assuming the solar refills the batteries completely each day.  So the powerwalls will cover 36% of our batteries on a full charge if our car is completely depleted. 

However, If you charge daily and only drive 100 miles or less/day, the powerwalls would cover it. I drive less than that on a daily basis so it should cover both my commute to work and my home energy consumption on a daily basis. Good question!"
"That's kinda a waste of money actually.

The reason you buy batteries (Powerwalls) is so you never have to use grid power during the day when it's (way) more expensive and also, hopefully, during the night if your batteries have stored enough juice.

Usually solar arrays produce more than enough (if sized correctly) to charge the batteries and power the house, including charging the car, during the day.

Then, during the night you use the batteries to power everything you want and if it's not enough you draw from the grid at a discounted rate (ToU only).

If however you have net metering you don't have to worry about any of this (usually)."
~50-70%
"What’s the point of power walls? Aside for when power is out and they can be used as backup power, what else are they useful for?"
"But, who really wants to see Natalie Portman as Thor version 2.  Terrible idea."
I think this is actually my dream
"and some states even give you rebates/Discounts for installing batteries! Oregon, Mass, Cail.  
I got 1500 rebates on my power walls when they were installed. (CA-SGIP)

&#x200B;

make sure you check local programs as well!"
"The incentives are amazing but as an average Joe, I still wonder what the cost was. 

I can guess it’s not even close to attainable for me but it’s really cool to see someone else with, basically, the ideal setup."
"they do a review of Estimated sun, factor in how many days of cloud and rain. then get an average and use it to compare with what you use for the year and that's how they size the system

I get about 91-93 % of my panels rated power. Transmission losses are 2-3% inversion is another 4-6%

All said and done peak power on my system is around 9.98kw with 33 panels in June/July."
"I'm not an expert, but I've read you can't both charge the batteries with solar and shift from grid. It could be the way it works or it could simply be the way or works where I live."
"the Powerwall cant be used to store power from the grid to Supply the grid later on a end user Basis. Utilities can use it in such a way but that's up to the utility.

I see your Logic though

get powerwall charge it early in the AM. then your solar can dump into the grid at a normal rate and when TOU goes to peak the solar keeps going to the grid while the PW runs the house.

for example my Super off peak is 13c regular is 30c and peak is 52c a setup like this would let me sell power for 30c that otherwise would have gone to charge my PW. and instead I pay 13c to charge it. a net of 17c per Kwh

that might work but the installer would have to neglect the Powerwall. or Work around. itthis means you don't get any off grid solar/powerwall abilites as the solar would have to be installed outside of the PW island and act as a separate unit. you would then have to rely on the grid details or the inverter to keep a log as you lose the data the powerwall provides."
You can. They're just big battery packs.
"As a broad answer, no. Many of our clients as this question (especially in markets where they get special rates during time of use for their electric cars). Most utilities prohibit time loaded energy storage."
He doesn't have a social security number for Roy!
Phase 5😂  Model Y is our Phase 4.
There are better systems for off grid use but a powerwall can operate independently of the grid if it goes down
"No, that’s the Midnight Sliver."
They don’t switch fast enough for that. You’re better off with a good aps for sensitive electronics
"Kind of. We get CREDITS for sending energy back to the grid. Not money. We consume those credits when the Powerwalls are depleted, in the winter when we are not producing enough solar to meet our needs or on high demand days."
At peak we hit about 6kW on an 8kW system.
Can you please clarify what you mean by 2 solars? What do you pay per kW? The best thing to do to answer that question is to go into your local Tesla and ask for an energy consultation.
"Lol! One of us is in Sales and one of us is a Software Engineer for two different, but very well known companies."
The two Tesla employee installers were really great and  very accommodating to our requests.
Hahaha! Awesome! Thank you:)
But if I stay with him... I get to keep all of it! 🤔
It can! The installers did this test a couple of times to make sure it was working properly. They turned the power main off and the lights barely flickered and stayed on. It was short enough that the router and internet stayed connected! Pretty cool stuff.
“were”
"That's why it's important to do your research. Also, if your *only* reason to do this is to save money, you might be doing it for the wrong reason."
"no power outages? low cost of power from clean sources? 

Solar and batteries at that point make no sense and Id Advise against it.

  
but for someone like me with 52c peak KWH costs? and 13c Super off peak?   
my powerwalls and solar pay themselves off in 7-8 years..   
that's were the batteries shine."
"Power walls are designed to store excess solar energy and feed your home off of at night. Unless you’re in a market where your net metering is tied into a TOU/poor tariff scheme (that list growing) you’re likely better off financially forgoing batteries right now.  As far as blackout proofing, the rules the battery follow are constrained by your utility."
"Do you charge them from the grid on off peak hours and then drain them using peak hours?

If so what is your ROI do you think?"
"At the time we installed solar, there was not an option for solar roof tiles:) when we need a new roof in 20 years, we will consider it."
"solar roofs are a waste unless you are in the market for a TILE roof which will reach cost parity with the Roof/Solar combo

got a newer tile roof? Get panels. more efficient, upgradable and removable if needed.

HOA rules are the only other reason I could see where solar roofs might be more attractive."
"They are cost prohibitive IF you’re not in the market for a new tile roof. If you’ve got a good roof or just want shingles, it’s smarter to work with standard PV cells.

It’s also a smarter decision to focus on a lower wattage PV panel then to pay a premium for newer high wattage panels IF you’ve got plenty of roof space. If you’re space constrained, go for the most power you can get vs your consumption"
No. We reserved two years before Tesla started delivering any Model 3s. We took delivery very soon after the Model 3 started delivering in California. We’ve had it a while. You can walk into a Tesla today and take delivery the same day.
Yes! We’ve only had it for 1 full day. It stated at 3% this morning . They hit 100% at around 6:00pm for both of them.
"They power the entire house at night. Or when the solar is not generating ( winter, cloudy days)."
I just think it’s wonderful that peoples wishes and dreams consist of wanting things like solar and batteries. Shows how far we’ve come.
We are still connected to the grid but will be way less dependent on it. We will still send energy to it when the Powerwalls are full and use it if and when the Powerwalls completely deplete.
"Apparently, they are!"
"You usually don't buy these for an investment.  The discounted pay back period is probably life expectancy.  You do this because you have the money and care about the cause.

Thanks to these adopters, it might be feasible for us plebeians in the future with cost reductions."
Yes! You can have any of them without the other! Most people just have a Tesla! But it’s pretty cool when you get solar and your energy is freeeee!
"Yes.

Hahaha! Love it!
If you keep picking at it you'll never heal.
How much did the whole set up cost?
Woohoo mine drive on moonlight 🌙. I sell the sunshine back to the grid for more credits.
That really is pretty cool.
Praise the sun!
Praise the sun!
You're welcome! (nephew here)
Where did you buy that?
"Perhaps if Tesla every allowed something like this, they could alter the warranty to include ""pack cycles""."
">then you supercharge up the Car at a Lower rate. and back feed it into the grid to make money

All the superchargers I've visited charge rates higher than retail consumer electric prices.

> so no utility is going to allow it

What are you talking about? Some utilities do allow you to sell power back to the grid at varying prices.

>not gonna happen from a OEM

The original Roadster supported Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and Elon has said they might do it again in the future.

>Pack could be down to 50% life because its been used as a home storage or some other way, such as Load shifting, or remote heavy power use cases.

Yeah? You'd have to opt-in to this usage, and there would be terms about affecting the battery warranty. It could easily track when it was discharging back to the grid, and deduct equivalent ""miles"" from your warranty. It could also likely be smart enough to discharge in ways that won't drastically increase battery degradation.

You really don't know what you're talking about at all."
Do you know what they're calling this feature? Have you seen a bidirectional charger actually available for purchase somewhere? I can find a lot of english-language press releases about v2g/v2h stuff but nothing tangible besides ~8 years and a hundred flavors of pilot study which never yields any public result.
they wouldn't be able to sell powerwalls..... We have two EVs.... it would be great to have a menu to power the home until 15% capacity is reached.... it would be great not having to setup the NG generator....
I think one thing when you have powerwalls is to take advantage of stored energy and try charging EV everyday.
"Don’t forget to account for efficiency loss. Round trip efficiency on PW2 is about 90%. If we are just looking at the loss for the output, we can probably round it to 5% roughly. Then we also have to account for input loss and inefficiencies from the car’s end. There’s also the whole max output only being 5kW which would make the charging time painfully slow. Point is, this doesn’t really make sense no matter how you look at it unless it’s a last resort type of thing."
Wow that’s great! Thanks.
"I believe so you can use power at night. Otherwise solar panels to my understanding don’t work as well, providing most of the power when you are not home to use it."
"How ""worth it"" they are is mostly dependent on your electric company. 

Like if you have a solar setup and you have the ability to sell all that electricity you are generating but not using back to the grid at a reasonable price... then you charge your EV at night for LESS money than you sold the solar generated electricity back to the grid for, then a Powerwall is pretty unnecessary unless you actually have power outages quite a bit...


But basically the point is you are generating a lot of energy through your solar panels, and you want to use all that clean energy. How do you do that when the majority of the energy is produced when you are likely using the least amount of energy to power your home, and energy you don't use is wasted? Basically you need to store all that energy you are generating to use throughout the day...So, If you can't sell energy back to the grid, Powerwalls make a LOT of sense."
Did you get lucky with Tesla installer for SGIP or did you have to source an installer yourself?

"Are you sure about the first part that Powerwall can’t be used purely for TOU shifting? 
https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/powerwall/mobile-app/time-based-control"
"90% of the time, this is all dependent on the Utility.some utilities like the ones in MA and VT will let you install or install one for you. but they get to use its Load shifting Abilities.

For the end user,  the pack must be used as backup only or Load shifting for the End users own use.

you cant backfeed with a powerwall using the power stored in that powerwall. as that would let you make money off the utilities own power they sold you earlier in the day."

"No I never have power outages where I live and electricity is cheap. 52 cents per kWh??? That’s insane!!!!! I’ve gotten as low as 1.3 cents per kWh here in Texas , hope that doesn’t make you sad ;)"
">someone like me with 52c peak KWH

Christ. Here I am complaining about 16¢/kwh here in Canada."
Where are your rates that high? My issue with the batteries is its much more green to not make these batteries which really are just there to try to slightly get better rates from the power company.
"Holy shit that’s expensive. I pay  10c / kwh all day, all year, in sweden. For clean energy (wind / hydro mix).
And $7/gal for gas, so an EV is cheaper per month at like 1k miles / month, while solar is harder to get a good roi on. 10-15 years if I do many things myself. 

Do you have any special requirements to use batteries during outages? We need special equipment installed and approved by the utility comp to ensure no back-feed on the grid (hazardous for the ppl working on the grid)."
"How much does this run? Doesn't look cheap. Not in the market, just curious"
"Yea these batteries make no sense to me. Honestly it seems like if you want to ""be green"" its more green to not manufacturer a bunch of batteries whose sole purpose is trying to get you slightly better rates. Just return your power to the grid. These things degrade and seem like such a waste to me to maybe break even on them by lower rates during the day... and maybe keep your house power on during a black out.

  
edit: I have an 8kish solar system and these batteries make 0 sense to me."
Yes! I’ll have to check the app to see what the +/- is but we’re considering adding another Powerwall this year.
Congrats y'all! Super jealous and hope to be able to do something like this in the next decade!
That’s amazing! Did you ever think 10 years ago any of this would be possible. It’s very cool.
I was trying to imitate the shorts who love to say that.
Yeah that is cool. So what do most people do to keep their teslas charged up? Can you just plug it into an outdoor socket?
"2 powerwalls, 17k installed and to provide that kinda of power for a EV will be 10-14Kw so 30-35k  for the solar.  


id bet all in 50-55k"
Me too!  I'm seriously thinking about those batteries tho.
You guys are cute! (human here)

"I'm sure they might. but its about the utilites allowing power to flow onto the grid from the car.  
the cars would be Massive load shifting Boons if they did that. but the utilities would have to do some lower then peak rates or they will lose money."
"you pay more then 50c a KWh? to supercharge?  because my peak rate is 53c a Kwh.

.28c kwh per Tesla's site. that means you could take that 28c Home with you and dump it into the grid at 53c?again... not going to happen. no Utility will allow this. you bought power from them for cheap and sold it back to them THE SAME POWER for more money.

&#x200B;

>*What are you talking about? Some utilities do allow you to sell power back to the grid at varying prices.*

you are partly correct, you sell power to the utility but its power YOU generated. Solar/Wind/ even some Nat gas and Bio reactors but not stored power that came from the grid. There is a difference.

>*The original Roadster supported Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and Elon has said they might do it again in the future.*

V2G is a Mis-nomer. its really V2Home. the roadster allowed you to power your HOUSE not sell that power to the grid. Tesla even back then didn't do that. check out the details. even the new Leaf is called V2G but its really V2H as the car powers the house.

>*Yeah? It could easily track when it was discharging back to the grid, and subtract equivalent ""miles"" from your warranty. It could also likely be smart enough to discharge in ways that won't drastically increase battery degradation.*

that's debatable. Right now? not sure,  if it monitored flow in and out Via an onboard system its possible. some additional hardware to invert and Island the house sure.

*You really don't know what you're talking about at all.*

actually I do know what i'm talking about as I work with grid operators and lineman daily. as my Field of workis in Heavy equipment and moving Industrial Transformers and the cranes that install them,  sorry you feel that i'm wrong on this, but i invite you to call up your utility and ask them if you can charge up a battery with low cost power to later pump it back into the grid."

"Assuming they are both 13kwh powerwalls,  and the model 3 is a 50kwh... if its LR, probably 40%."
In Florida we have storms. The power goes out a lot. And I have powerwall for that reason.
What zip code are you in? That and obvious shading and azimuth of the system are the details to know before attempting to broadcast production.
"I didn't say it cant be used for TOU shifting what i meant to say is it cant be used to Game the grid operator.

Example it cant be used to Charge up at 13c per Kw and Discharge ONTO the grid for 52c per Kwh. this is a profit for you of 39c per Kwh done this way.

but it can be used to charge up at 13c per kwh and Discharge  power to your home when power is at 52c Kwh

This is a savings of 39c per Kwh.

the difference is you cant use the powerwall to ""make"" you money but you can use it to ""save"" you money as its part of Most utility agreements. power comes in at a lower rate for TOU  then goes into your home from the battery power when rates are High meaning that you only pay 13c for a Kwh during times when power is 52c since you stored it earlier but power CAN NOT go back into the grid from the battery Basically"
that a load whereby this are more or less an energy exchanger
I like those there are also even some partial carbon AGM batteries for lower cost that work quite well. LGs are the most often selected batteries right now
Yes but they won’t support your AC if the grid is down or other high draw startup systems like a well pump
"Environmental consciousness. Maybe you could capture some of that heat coming out of your collar, too."
"Not 52, but my EV-A rate in the San Francisco area is 46.9 cents/kWh during peak (2-9pm weekdays, 3-7pm weekends/holidays), 35.8 cents/kWh during ""part-peak"" (11am-2pm and 9pm-11pm weekdays), and 15.6 cents/kWh during offpeak (all other times)."
"all current model inveters must have the Ability to isolate themselves and Shutdown during an outage. they also must meet the rules provided by the Utility to connect. this is called permission to operate or PTO.

Tesla's Powerwall has an automated Relay that prevents power from back-feeding from the batteries onto the grid. In the event of a power outage a Relay trips and the relay contractors disengage. this creates a Localized Grid and now the power wall can run the household. 

my powerwalls are able to switch fast enough to Provide Constant power even when under load from the AC unit. when the grid goes down for whatever reason its Seamless. the times i've been awake/home. I don't know its even happened."
$7700ish per battery installed
"we service and install systems across 26 states. Locally in San Diego, for example, you’d be paying $.54 per kWh between 4&9 pm so you’d need approximately 170% offset to build enough credits in to neutralize the part where the typically homeowner uses 40% of their power. 


In 4-5 years they will come down in price and at some point utilities will stop counting your feed in credits or in an extreme case like Hawaii, penalize you for feeding in at all at which point you should have batteries

Good luck with your system!"
"Outdoor socket is Level 1 charging.  You can do it, but it is SSSLLLOOOWWW, and at \~110V/12A you’re only adding 30 miles after an hour of charging.

OP’s charger and those that you see at shopping centers and offices are Level 2 (240V.)

The Tesla-branded chargers that you see here and there are Level 3 (240V) and fast.  You’re taking a lot of juice in a short amount of time, and if you’re on an “empty tank” and trying to get back up to \~300 miles for driving, it’s going to take \~1 hour.  So, if you’re doing a road trip, you’d stop in and have a meal, use the restroom, etc."
"You install a 240 socket in your garage and plug your Tesla into that. Whatever your local energy utility uses for power generation is they type of energy that is charging into your car. If you get solar, you know where it came from, and that it’s sunshine."
You're over estimating the size of solar required. We drive 2 Tesla's per day for about 120 miles total and running lots of AC. Our solar system is 10.5 kW and we still run a surplus of energy. I would imagine a system much smaller at 6-8 kW is sufficient.
"OP forgot Step 4.

Step 4 - change current solar to Tesla Solar Roof.

Pretty sure after that, it’s endgame.. til they upgrade to a new Tesla car"
17k installed b4 tax credits?  What company if you don't mind sharing? Several companies quoted 19K-20k for 2 of the Powerwalls.
"I have a 5KW system. 3 bed 2 bath house. So far I've never had a power bill (other than connection fees and taxes) after solar came on. No electric car (yet), but I imagine that would only need an extra KW or two."
"Not very economical. 50k in a 6% fund like sphix would give you 3k a year or 250 a month. Do you think your power bill has been reduced by 250 a month?....plus what is the life or depreciation? 

We still have a ways to go to get to the tipping point here."
I'm hungry. (cat here)

Did you make it yourself?
"Average per kwh in my state is $0.10


Supercharger can't charge us per kwh, we have to pay per minute because only the utility companies can sell electricity directly in my state"
Sounds like you’re in San Diego
"Do utilities really buy back electricity at peak retail rates? That seems unlikely to me.

Where I live, electricity is ~$0.11/kWh and Tesla charges by the minute (equivalent to about ~$0.20/kWh).

>the roadster allowed you to power your HOUSE not sell that power to the grid

Of fucking course it didn't. Plugging in your Roadster doesn't turn your meter into a bidirectional one. But if you have such a meter, how are V2H and V2G not equivalent?

>ask them if you can charge up a battery with low cost power to later pump it back into the grid.

If I have a two-way meter, and they buy back electricity, how can they prevent me from charging up a battery cheaply and selling it back to the grid?"
">.28c kwh per Tesla's site. that means you could take that 28c Home with you and dump it into the grid at 53c

Give me a break. Not only is that hilariously impractical, most people in the US pay far less per kWh than what Tesla wants for supercharging. This is a non-issue."
"I see a lot of marketing puffery here plus one indirect statement (at the very end) suggesting that v2h/v2g equipment *might* now, or soon, or eventually be available for purchase in Australia. Your comment seemed to imply a little more reality behind the idea... if that's all there is I think we're probably still in the endless-pilot-study zone."

"Yes, totally understood, so now add solar into the mix with net metering and you can almost accomplish this, but I’ve heard that Tesla won’t allow it as it would be a violation of the ITC to allow you to charge Powerwall from the grid (storm watch notwithstanding). But I’ve been curious if you elected to install Powerwall first and THEN add solar, since you’re no longer able to claim the ITC, there theoretically shouldn’t be a reason why they’d disallow this. 

Now granted, forgoing 30% off Powerwall isn’t a great option, and most TOU (if they even allow for net metering) plans probably aren’t going to be lucrative during the most productive solar hours, so this is probably more of an academic question, but I’m still curious as the ITC is scheduled to phaseout in 2022, will Tesla allow the user to choose how they want to charge Powerwall even if paired with solar?"
"I looked at the LG-Chem Resu, but I have an Outback system, and I’m not sure the inverter and battery pack can communicate yet"
What's the approx startup time of the powerwall?  Is there a good APS than can handle the flicker 'switch' time from grid going down to powerwall coming online?   Thanks!
"Not everyone likes Tesla for the same reasons. I personally don’t care too much about saving the environment by using an electric vehicle. I care more about it becoming a robotaxi and making money on a car I would otherwise make no money on. I also like them because of looks and style inside and out and the features they have. I drive about 30 miles a day so gas isn’t much of a problem for me.

As far as the power wall goes, like I said, electricity is cheap here so it doesn’t make sense for me. That and we don’t really have power outages where I live at all."
What company can do for that cheap?
"Why would hawaii penalize you for feeding into the grid? Because there is too much solar being generated and the grid can't handle it?

That is such terrible policy to not have net metering, forcing people to have batteries to store their solar because of rate reasons is extremely bad energy policy, batteries have an environmental cost, for cars it makes sense because you are using them instead of burning gas, and  the cost is much less, but for your home its unnecessary because of the grid... 
Hopefully good politicians come in and squash that awful policy."
Gotcha. So solar is just keeping the EV vibe pure.
You are right on the money. System is 8kW. It was about $16k after federal incentive. About the same for the 2 powerwalls installed. Together it was around $32k or so. It’s enough to power the house and the car 100%. And I drive a lot!
prob right. I have a Pool and was basing it off my base usage. Low AC use and no pool could easily be in the 8kw range. as 8kw in a sunny climate nets you about 50Kwh of generated power... which might be around 30-40% surplus power in the summer.
that is determined on a use and fill rate basis. There’s no perfect formula that applies to each home as far as how many batteries would be ideal
Hehe he said solar system and I intentionally read it wrong
"Step 5: ?

Step 6: Profit!"
"Why would he do that? Current solar panels have a lifetime of ~25 years, never mind the fact that Solar Roof isn't actually available yet."
"I get what you are saying, but it does not seem terrible. If gas is $4/gallon. $250/$4=62.5gallons. If a sedan got 30mpg * 62.5 gallons = 1875miles/month.  1875/20days work per month=94miles per work day.  If they drive a lot, or if gas prices go up, it might work out okay. This would all be way better if the buy-in was cheaper though! You’re right."
The comparison should be against savings in the electric bill. I am installing solar in California and the solar is expected to give me 100% financial offset and a 10 year loan on the panels is costing the same as my average electric bill.

"it is but remember people who don't need to beg for money will sit on the side of the road to get free money (example, not always the case) and 2 grown adults that live on my street go through the cans every friday to get the plastics and Alum out of the recycle after its on the curb.  People go to great lengths to save a buck or make a buck."
Haha brother (or sister) I was only gonna suggest a good number of sun hours based on that local. I don’t want an address or anything and I the poster doesn’t want advice I’m also willing not to offer it.
Around 3 seconds.  A network grade APS should be sufficient for your electronics
All binro said was that some people don't make the decision FOR ONLY ONE REASON.
"(That’s assuming solar at the same time with a least 5kW per battery) 

I’m not here to advertise and unless I just don’t get reddit I have no idea how to dm you"
Yes because they’re a closed loop system with no neighboring markets to offload the excess.   That results in all sorts of problems.  They do offer some pretty attractive credits for batteries to offset the elevated cost of going solar
....and low cost/free if your solar system is paid for.
"That is so awesome and I’m really jealous 😁 I want to install solar too but alas, still in a condo building."
"Did you get the Powerwalls because you don’t have net metering? (EDIT: I think I meant TOU, not net metering. I don’t have TOU)

I’d like to get one in case the power goes out, but we have net metering and everything I’ve read says it only makes sense financially if you don’t have net metering"
32k is a lot of money. The roi is going to ne longer than the lifespan of the devices
"Pools use a crazy amount of energy. I had no idea. I have a 4K sf house, work from home with the AC blasted all day, and charge a tesla model x, and my solar usage says the pool is still 50% of my total energy usage. I  never had a clue."
We have a pool (variable speed pump) and live in a very hot area of California (it was 107 yesterday). Our 8kW system is enough. We try to be very efficient with energy though.
"actually. Solar panels last A LOT longer then 25 years. usually after about 10% degradation they level off and lose something like 0.2-3% until about 80% output at that point Degradation stops if weather is stable.  
if you oversized to 120% (which could be as little as 1-2 more panels) you would be at 100 % output AFTER 25 years.   
In another 8-9 years we will know the output of the newest gen of Panels (24/7 on time takes about 7-8 years to fully test as a 20 year life span degradation. but current numbers are better then we have expected. with less then 6% loss over 10 years."
"Right, probably why OP didn’t end up with the TSR. But judging by OP’s handle and license plate, they live in California.

Chances are they will be able to acquire it a lot sooner because of location and the fact that they already have the cars and Powerwall.  I mean it’s an easy advertisement from Tesla once they have the whole package"
You are forgetting replacement costs as well. My point was towards buying electricity compared to the solar set up....
"Can you explain 100% financial offset....

This is still many years away from being ""economical"". I firmly believe in time the EV will be to the tipping point where a CE will be obsolete. I just think we are about a decade away from the economics to really get there. 

I think the EV will get there much sooner than solar, as the EV mechanical life/maint costs are so much less. As the battery improves every year it gets better and better."
"And today I’m standing next to my batteries, or am I?"

One day :). I dreamed of this for almost 20 years. Set my mind to it and it happened. Just gotta follow your dreams :)
ROI is not the reason we did it. We did it because we think we should (and luckily we can).
"It doesn’t pencil out in Portland metro for solar. I tried it on google solar (although we don’t use much electricity, about $55 a month at 11c per kWh)"
"It sounds like your pump is running way too often. Typically only need to run 8 hours a day at the most. Or ideally, get a variable speed pool pump. It can run at a much lower speed to circulate most of the time, only kicking up to full speed when needed, which saves a ton of power."
Are we talking about heated pools here or am I overlooking something really obvious?
"You need to change the speed of your pump.  Mine uses 500W for 12 hours running at 30GPM.  At full speed it uses 2.2kW for only double the throughput.  Lots of info about this if you search (fluid dynamics efficiency).  Also use Time of Use, and run your pump during the ev periods (10 pm-8 am for me)."
Not including the basement I'm in a 3500sqft home and AC is 90% my usage.  If I ran the ac all day I could hit 200kw.
To heat it? Or just the filter & pump?
I would like to subscribe to your solar facts newsletter.
Tesla does not advertise.
"With Net metering and 30% tax credit applied, the monthly payments on a 10 year loan for Solar install are coming out to be the same as what I pay for electricity today without solar (average for the year). The power generated will reduce my electric bill to essentially zero (Minimum charges from utility still apply) so in effect the system would be paid off in 10 years without any extra spend. Beyond that, it’s going to make money since it’s covered for labor and parts for 25 years (And will effectively fully offset the small monthly connection charge we must pay)."
"And as always, thanks for watching."
By a Reddit employee :). Don’t think you can find it for sale though.
"If you’re gonna go south facing, 1600 sun hours is a safe number (although in a great year it could be 10% above that) to base off but in your market, ideally you’d want to concentrate on south facing but also get 20+% of the system facing west because of time of use. That is assuming you don’t have taller neighboring homes or shading to contend with."

most of the numbers come from a Study done in 2000 and another in 2012. which show the 80% after 20 years true for units made in 2000.  then for units made in 2012  its 0.5 loss/yr . anything newer such as Panasonic's HIT used by Tesla is prob around .3 or even less. that's 20 years to lose just 6% output."
"I meant as a free advertisement towards Tesla like this post.  Kinda like by “word of mouth”.

Either way it’s a win win for everyone!  OP gets to enjoy their products and we get to learn a few things from them (Ie; asking questions regarding how much kWh they consume from the powerwall, etc)"
😭

And be lucky. We are very fortunate and thankful for being able to do this.
Quick math says the ROI on this conversation: Not worth it. Have a lovely day!
The average American spends over $2k/yr on gas and about the same amount on electricity (and that's assuming a natural gas hook up for the stove). So that says that the ROI starts looking good after 8 years in... and that's assuming energy/gas prices remain stable.
It is a complicated multi-variable problem. The solution will also be multi-variable. Planting trees being one of them. Which is why every year I donate money for planting trees. I also request my friends and family to do the same in my name instead of giving me birthday gifts. I stopped eating meat in 2005. Solar+EV+Batteries is just part of the effort.
"It abso-fucking-lutely isn't!

Planting trees is a waste of time and money.

ROI is millions of times better if you address the actual problem, ie the reason we fuck up the environment.

OP is doing much more for the environment by investing/spending the money onto renewables (and posting the result here)."
Variable speed is where it’s at. Replaced an old pump on his pool and it’s uses about 30% of the electricity that the old one did. His pump was really old and strained though.
Variable speed pumps make a HUGE difference. Single speed pumps use an ungodly amount of energy.
"would a saltwater conversion require less circulation/aeration? also, a variable speed pump?"
"absolutely. I’m happy to answer any other questions if you wanna bookmark this thread and reply later I’ll reply ASAP. 

Also if you don’t wanna pay the $2.85/watt pricing I’m happy to help there too but this wasn’t meant to be any type of sales pitch. More panels on more roofs is what makes me happy!"
Lol fair enough.
That's what my basic math came out to as well. On top of that it is like OP said. Just because it may not be 100% cheaper right now doesn't mean we shouldn't do it. Cheaper never means better. Once people understand that we will all be better off.

"a Large pump like mine is a 2.5Hp unit (most are 1-1.5) uses upwards of 2kw for 8 hours a daythe average house hold uses 20-32 Kwh daily. the pool pump would increase the power use of the example house by 30-40% if using a large pool pump.  its a lot of power.

saltwater requires a generator which also uses A lot of power to turn the salt into Chlorine. so a salt water pool uses more power then a Chlorine based pool.  the advantage is you dump salt in and it slows down algea and bacteria growth and you can use that salt to be ionized to make Chlorine. Salt pools are Lower maintaince but you pay for it with more cost, complexity, and power usage."
I bought a house with solar installed.. How can I tell if I'm getting the right efficiency out of it?
"What you claim is: Don't get drug addicts off drugs, just give them free food and shelter, it will fix all their problems.

FYI, 4-7 Billion trees per year get cut down. To plant that many trees you have to spend around $1 Billion each and every year just to keep up with the destruction.

If you think this sounds good, right back at you bud."
Is your power bill zero? That’s usually a good place to start
"It's not.. But it's not a huge system and I charge my car as well.

That should be an available color if Tesla ever gets that robot taxi thing working.
Wonder what this would look like with white interior?  Probably like a banana & a banana peel
Put some FakeTaxi stickers on it 😅
Adorable
"This looks more like a toy than a car. With the clean front and eveything. No air intakes, no licence plate, there arent even ""real"" door grips :D something a toymaker would do.

It just looks so different from a conservative car"
Uh what?

My license plate is actually “JOLTEON” so I would *love* this wrap.
Needs the black go-faster stripes.
BA-NANAAAAAAA!!!!!
Was that the pearl yellow?  My friend had one that color and I thought it looked really nice.
can confirm - had a bright yellow mk1 MR2
What do you mean?
Multipass!
Nice
And there’s always room in the banana hammock.
"Too true. Had a ’76 VW Rabbit in Rally Yellow, loved that colour. Yellow cars and trucks always get a second look from me."
"I agree.  I had a yellow Mini Cooper before I got my Model S.  I was disappointed that yellow was not an option when I bought it, and now I am doubly disappointed after seeing how good this 3 looks in yellow!"

What's the deal with yellow now?

Nice

I don’t. You guys are ludacris
I wonder what they think of Uber/Lyft
"That practically make us family! Uncle Bobby B, baby, uncle Bobby B!"
"Yellow went down really well with ladies...   so there was that going for it to make up for the bugs.  
I like lime - maybe with the purple on the inside  
although if you're going for maximum loudness, I always liked the fluorescent orange like the racing marshals uniforms"
"I had an ""electric lime green"" jeep wrangler and I had zero issues or complaints. Get it, that color is awesome."
"there is no deal with yellow, keep yellow on exotic cars like ferraris' and lambos'. if you put yellow on a sedan like the model 3, it looks more like a taxi."
"like, VW beetles? or the small 6 legged kind?"
It does? I've never heard of this before. My gf has a yellow VW beetle and it doesn't really get more bugs than my silver tesla.
And he told us of his life in the land of EVs
"Full speed ahead Mr. Parker, full speed ahead"
"The Beatles, not Ludacris."
Not on the Model 3.....
It doesn't. The car is moving way too fast for any possibility of a bug being attracted to it and consequently getting stuck on the front of the car.

Lmao
"I have to imagine the conversation went like this 

“Get me a fancy tech car for our segment on segment on distracted driving”

-intern delivers picture of model 3 interior. 

“This does not look like a normal car, fix it. No one will get what it is.”

-Intern makes center screen look like CarPlay. 

“No the center dash you idiot, where are the air vents?”

-intern adds air vents.

“Perfect! Get this guy a raise!”

-you do not pay me sir...

“Out of my office plebeian scum!”"
Omg it’s CarPlay on the Model 3 😁
Looks like a mid 2000s Subaru center stack with a big ass screen.
No mention of Tesla was made though
I have to assume some graphics producer is ecstatic with their work today. The rest of the world is ready to shame them.
I feel sorry for whoever has to go through this shit on TV.
/r/wtf
Is this the refresh? Lol
[deleted]
We need u/kenriko to make a center console wrap that looks like an old CD/cassette deck.
Is that an 8track player in the dash?
I had to do a double take at first. My initial reaction was definitely “WTF???”
What in the methamphetamine?
[deleted]
LMFAO this is great
If love to know just WHY this was considered necessary... Someone actually had to put this together as part of their job. WTF
What a bunch of clowns
But why tho
"Actually, I think the idiots just combined bits and pieces to make it look as distracting as at all possible.  The display image is a total (and ridiculous) fabrication."
LIES!
Terrible-what’s the point ?
"Redefining the interior of a Model 3 in Oder to justify the content “Distracted Driving” is advocacy journalism.
Coming to a conclusion and creating context out of thin air to justify it.
Similar to manipulating data to “prove” the chosen outcome of a science experiment. 
Is it any wonder we are losing faith in our media outlets ?

Has anyone ever seen the cockpit of the average first responders vehicles, Fire, EMS, Police ?
How’s that for distracted driving?"
"Another reason why I don’t watch them.

Falsifying stuff."
That's some awful photoshop work...
You forgot the quotes around “News”.
This is Elon's new 8 Track Tape option.  Buy it and your car will appreciate in value!
wtf
"Don't do drugs, kids."
Wow so ^in^accurate
"American news media is such a sad joke. Some woman painted like a clown and bizarre photo-shopped images that came from god knows where. Seriously, who watches this crap any more?"
"Pretty much sums up the ""news"" these days."
Why would they do this??!?
I do have concerns about gauges & warning signals in the center of the console. I can't see how that isn't distracting.
better get norah o'donnell to test drive a tesla 3 so she knows wtf she is talking about
🤦
What? That's BS
Lol wtf
WTH is this. Why would they even?
What the actual fuck?
Lol. Disgusting
Model 3 refresh is here!
News graphics are always laughable but this is just gross.
The center stack is pasted from a 2010-2014 Subaru Legacy
LOL broadcast 'news'.
Can we get a link to the actual news article?
Surely tesla can sue over this?
"Ooooh. Dey got dat Sony Xplod. 

::car gets broken into. Head unit stolen::"
What in God’s name?!! hahaha
"LOLOL, I wish someone got a video on this."
I have to laugh
Nice Tesla Outback
I love how the LTE bars extend the screen.

"So we get legit, completely biased news reporting on tesla and the overly defensive tesla trolls are nowhere to be found?

Is this real life?

This shit needs to be saved and added to a compendium of glaringly biased reporting against tesla."
"Probably a stock photo they used, no way that they edited that themselves"
This is so poor.

The media is a joke now. Most people are online. They're desperate for ratings and they are targeting a small population that doesn't use the internet
r/therewasanattempt
"Lol, love it."
"I'm of the opinion that newscasters have been replaced by robots for several decades, at least in the US ... no healthy brain can cope with such brain shredders."
why
That layout 😣
Wtf
The LTE signal bar goes slightly left out of the screen's border
I have an unhealthy hatred for network news from both politics and Tesla. I want to watch network news fail and cease too exists.
"I wanna see the ""news"" on it. Irrespective of being fake, I would love to hear the commentary on this! WTF!!"
Do they get paid two do this or is it part of the job...
"Now I gotta find all my CD organizers, had no idea I had a CD player. I learn something new about my car every day!"
"Ayyy they’re playing “The Daily” podcast, that’s my jam."
That center looks like the upper of a 2010-2014 Outback/Legacy.
Why?  Just why?
"Yes, the AI enabled, internet connected, GPS triangulated car that also has a cassette/CD player. Lol"
What’s the point of targeting tesla? You think someone with a car worth tens of thousands of dollars and in some cases hundreds is gonna wanna drive distracted? They were better off putting a normal ass center console picture and photoshopping someone with their phone in their hand or something
"SeeBS.

Why do you people still watch corporate news? They don't care about the truth."
"It's illegal to use you phone while driving in my province so Android Auto is totally necessary. What I miss most about my civic with Android Auto is having access to: podcast addict, Spotify, Libby (library audiobooks), Audible. Also google maps fully integrated with my previous search's.

They even did CarPlay 13B4!"
They should have installed a HUD.  #opportunitymissed
Those liars can not just report the news. They have to photoshop everything to fit their lying narrative.
"That's what you call ""photoslopped"""
"No they didn't 

some intern was probably tasked to make a distracted looking interior and used the model 3 as the background."
This is bizarre. How scared of Tesla can you be to pull this crap? What’s the intention there?
People are always ready to discredit the new “thing”
Let’s get this to the front page!! All aboard the upvote hyperloop!!
I smell a lawsuit!
Meh it's just an illustration to get the point across about distracted driving.  They made it generic on purpose.  It's not meant to be any specific brand or model.
That new Apple car on the way.
"Wow, did she also try to make her face look normal.  I mean what is going on there!  Seems like she is trying too hard to look like, well....Aunt Sally?  (UK reference)"
Typical uninformed left
IANAL but this image was modified just enough (and specifically) to make it clear to most viewers that it’s a “futuristic AI driving car” but altered enough to remove any obvious Tesla trademarks (i.e. a lawsuit implying Tesla’s promote distracted driving)
Thant makes a lot of sense.
Experience = $
"> “Out of my office plebeian scum!”

And don't come back until you have some pictures of spiderman!"
laugh all you want but Apple Carplay (and Android Auto) is a life changing experience on par with NOA/FSD.  Once you’ve lived it it is hard to abandon.  Seriously makes me envious of my wife’s Chevrolet Volt.
"*This* is what you've all been clamoring for?  Huh, to each their own."
"And it’s not even the current iteration, it’s the CarPlay that’s still in beta."
iOS13 even ;)
"#CLICKS ""ADVANCED"" UPDATES CHANNEL"
Model 3 ?
Wtf the car play thing they are using looks more like the new version due this fall.
"Spot on. 

I had a 2010 legacy before my model 3 and that has the little door flipped up but it’s the Subaru for sure."
This is the most disturbing detail. Subconscious anti-marketing.
Why the hell use a Model 3 interior then? Seems like an awful lot of work for nothing lol.
Thats a good thing.
"No, they don’t want to get in trouble for criticizing Tesla. Distracted driving is bad no matter what brand the car is. If they single out one company, they could be liable for damages"
"I haven't watched mainstream TV in many years. It's just something that runs in the background at the gym. If it's not on youtube, I haven't seen it. Thank goodness for live streaming of sports."

Will somebody PLEASE think of the children!
To make it look more distracting.
Media is paid for by advertising. Tesla does not buy ads so they slander Tesla.
"Yeah, former EMT/ambulance driver here.

At least 2 radios to keep in touch with base and local FD. Siren controls, light controls, inverter and misc controls.

But like a pilot in a 747, it looks complicated but in reality at any given time 90% of them are irrelevant.  Just drive along, one finger on the siren button, watching out for idiots who don't see you."
It's a heavily modified picture and there isn't a Tesla logo visible anyway.
What? why?
I sure hope so
"Nah, they just go for dumbasses with big hair and  veneered teeth that won’t question anything. Cheaper than a robot."
A generic car model with the caratheristic screen of the model 3 and x
"No
It’s meant to be a Tesla Model 3 since 99.9 % of the Vehicles Out In The Real World, Globally 
Have an instrument cluster behind the steering wheel

Not persecution but clear directed bias"
"Completely agree, it's getting persecution-complex levels ridiculous in here."
Bingo. This was done because no automaker would give CBS permission to use its real interior for a segment about distracted driving.
It also adds more buttons to make it more scary and distracting.
Yup. Model 3 is to cars as iPhone is to phones.
"""IANAL"" who says shit like this?"
"I know, it’s just a joke."
Did you say I anal?
"I had internships back in my day. I know.

Although mine paid 15 an hour."
"No, this mentality needs to die. People should be paid for their labor, the experience is just part of the package, stop pretending it justifies tricking kids into working for free. Thanks. It’s already hard enough to pay the bills while in school."
What exactly does it do that is so amazing? I ask this because I went from a car where I had to plug a headphone jack into my phone to a model 3 so I don't know what I'm missing. Eli5 please.
"Agreed.  It’s one of the big reasons I haven’t purchased a Tesla yet.  

I can understand Tesla’s position of not sharing data with other companies as that is a big part of their business.  Apple does not require data sharing for a manufacturer to integrate CarPlay.  It would ostensibly be a simple thing for Tesla to add and would fit nicely in the lower third of the UI.   

I wish they would stop wasting resources on making updates to things like the sketch app and video games and make this CarPlay thing happen."
"I gave up using it. Sometimes it works, but other times it just disconnects and restarts erratically. Apple software works so well because they design the devices their software runs on. With all different makes and models of cars, they lose that advantage. It just doesn’t work very well unfortunately."
I understand and respect that point. Fwiw I did have a 2017 Audi with it. I was a lot more excited about Tesla Maps personally but again that's just me. I'm not saying the large number of people asking for these features are wrong or anything!
"I will agree that CarPlay is good, when it works. However, I had a Chevy Volt for three years and it was three years of grief to get it to consistently work. Connectivity issues were only the beginning. Several visits to Chevy service did nothing to solve the problems, emphasis on the plural. There were times I gave up and just used the bluetooth interface to listen to podcasts and the like. Haven't given it another thought in the Tesla. Even though it's not perfect. 

FYI: iPhone 7-plus, regularly updated. CarPlay interface was wired only. Tried several cables."
"Dealerships in my city want to charge $465 CAD to install Apple CarPlay on my 2018 Mazda 3. 

Does this seem outrageous?"
"Yeah seriously. I put CarPlay in my 2010 Impreza, and every time I drive my moms 2016 pilot for any amount of time the tech experience is just plain miserable."
"My experience with it is that it takes control of the infotainment entirely and slows it to a crawl when all you wanted to do was simply charge your dying phone.  Also, no way to turn it off permanently, as it resets itself every time you plug it in. Basically saying I’m not a fan."
"Fusion Energi owner here, AA/Carplay are the best. Carplay was a joke until Waze and G-Maps were finally added (better late than never). 

I get that FSD requires an on-board nav system API but for those who opted out or just enjoy manual driving, having AA/Carplay would give us the best of both worlds."
"That’s a bold statement. My Tesla software works. The Apple CarPlay barely worked. I understand they had to make it work on a bunch of hardware, but it was not life changing. The only thing I miss is it reading my text messages to me. But again, it was super buggy. Tesla navigation is way better too."
"I absolutely hated it in my Niro. The model 3 feels so much better in every way possibly. Fuck Apple Carplay, it's useless."
"Pretty large stretch to put an infotainment system up against a technology that can freaking drive a car, in my opinion. Coming from someone who has had Apple CarPlay and now owns an S."
"Haha seriously no. I only get CarPlay in rentals, and it’s shit. It blocks the screen from doing anything else but the app you are using, so if your spouse is for instance browsing Spotify, you ain’t getting your Waze navigation.

I can understand that getting CarPlay in normal cars is a life changing experience, but it’s still a glued on solution on bad hardware. Its nowhere as integrated as Tesla’s system."
What about it is so great for you? I’ve used CarPlay in the Audi A4.. it’s nice to read/send texts (voice only) and have Spotify (coming to US Model 3)- that’s about it. Every other aspect is inferior or something Tesla could implement (and do it better) in the future.
"I rented a Volt recently and tried Android Auto, and want really that impressed. It'd be nice to have options still, I guess."
I compelety disagree. Everyone is different. We have android auto in our other car and I never use it. I'd much rather have Tesla's set up.
"Eh, most infotainment systems suck, but Audi's MMI is pretty fantastic, and I prefer it over AA/CP."
Lol yep it’s like mixing from a Tesla model 3 to a Volt. You do that. I prefer teslas software and performance. No apple/android garbage in my car thank you very much.
"Do you actually realise that using the Carplay maps (i. e. Apple Maps or something) will mean you couldn't use NoA, because the car doesn't know where to go? 🤪

Oh and having tried Carplay the first time a week ago, I'm really disappointed. A couple of bugs (like what the heck; they were all on Apple's side, not Fords), many missing features, ... Well, not too bad but not nearly as good as I expected it to be."
"Eh, you have to plug it in every time and it can be a little temperamental. The Tesla infotainment system is just as good."
You’re kidding right? Those are even comparable. You’re comparing infotainment to driver assist tech.
"Most cars (with a notable exception of Tesla) can have their stereos replaced, so you can probably get CarPlay. Take a look at [Crutchfield](https://www.crutchfield.com) if you don’t have a Tesla. Fill out your car’s info and it’ll filter their available radios to ones that’ll fit your car. Usually they have mounting brackets and whatnot for your specific car too, sometimes even for free."
"My wife's Pacifica Hybrid has carplay and android auto.  Other than Spotify, I MUCH prefer Tesla's system."
"Android Auto has changed my life for the worse. It's way too invasive and controlling where just giving my phone a place to sit in view while driving would be simpler, cheaper, better. It's unreliable and the lack of controls for basic things I can do natively on my phone is a bad user experience."
I doubt CarPlay will ever be added. It's not a free thing they can just build into the firmware. There are ongoing licensing costs from Apple. There was an article recently about BMW now charging owners an $80 annual fee for CarPlay access.
"I was being half sarcastic there. Yes there are a lot of people clamoring for this as a feature. Personally it would be nice but I'm not a huge fan. I like having my car and phone separated and I'm a fan of Tesla's built in apps. 

Most cars with CarPlay/AA have used it as an excuse to let their built in infotainment abilities rot."
"Someone did their homework. CAR OF THE FUTURE, INCLUDING UNRELEASED SOFTWARE"
😂🤣
Yes!  My wife test drove a bunch of 2010ish outbacks recently. Definitely it.
This is incredibly dangerous to our democracy.
"No, they don’t want to get in trouble for criticizing Tesla. Distracted driving is bad no matter what brand the car is. If they single out one company, they could be liable for damages"
this is not anti-marketing. People are obsessed with FU.D in this sub.
"Same reason movie makers use Apple products but put clunky fake logos over the Apple logo.

“These are leading edge futuristic computers with style”"
Ironically the autopilot features make distracted driving less of an issue for Teslas than most cars.
"Tofu holder (get thee behind me, seitan)"
Huh? News organizations need permission to show a car?
Only to fanbois.
Seriously. Not Everything needs an acronym.
"well I think we all use our anals at some point in the day, it's a natural part of digestion.

I, anal too."
"Legally, any internship where you're doing actual work, you have to get paid. If you getting coffee, doing repeat work, shadowing, reading things, etc. you do not have to get paid, but if your work provides value to the company, they have to pay you at least minimum wage."
"I’m my experience having interned at 3 different places, I was put into “positions” that didn’t really exist to do tasks that were often duplicated by someone that actually worked there.  An internship is supposed to be learning to work in an industry. I received offers from all three companies at the conclusion. 

I wouldn’t trade that scenario vs making them real jobs that are harder to get and likely require experience that you don’t have"
Maybe students should get paid for their homework
"In America, most unpaid internships are illegal. Unless the internship is just shadowing, getting coffee, or doing menial tasks, the intern must be paid at least minimum wage."
"As an LA commuter, Waze gives the best routes. CarPlay supports it natively."
it allows you to interact with your phone's apps within the car's os
The UI is incredible. I use Android Auto in my Audi. It's the best infotainment system I've ever used
"For me the biggest thing is texting. I’m a minority but I really like voice control, so when a text comes in I hit the screen and it reads it to me, then asks me to respond, so on and so forth."
[deleted]
"Carplay is loaded with features not found on the Tesla
1) 3 different map apps - google, apple and waze
And some of those have the routing option “avoid highways” so I can maximize battery efficiency.
2) voice read/write texting
3) better integration with contacts on the phone - for example when i ask Tesla to call “xx yy mobile” Tesla presents a list of all phone numbers associated with xx yy where I have to select one. Carplay just dials the mobile number.
4) An app for Sirius/XM"
[deleted]
"My 10y  old mini has a basic push button radio, and a parrot Bluetooth car kit. To this I added a Bluetooth aux phono connector, and a mount for my phone.

I can now push a button on the steering wheel to activate Google assistant - allowing me to use my voice to initiate calls, play whatever music I want, dictate text messages, and set new navigation destinations. The phone screen adapts to work like an ICE system, with big buttons to switch between nav, music, phone and notifications.

The app is regularly updated, unlike an embedded in car unit.

The irony is that newer vehicles struggle with integration. My 2018 fiat Ducato will Bluetooth to the phone, but rather than letting the phone handle a voice dial request (which invokes Google assistant), it has it's own crappy built in voice recognition that just looks at my phone contacts."
"Basically imagine having your phone mounted on your dashboard, connected to your audio by bluetooth, but instead of interracting with the phone with no latency, you interract with the car's screen with some latency and you can't use all of your apps."
Me too.
It lets people who are addicted to texting do it while they drive.
"No Siri hands free lag

Native apps 

More navigation options, waze!!!!

Simply being able to use your phone for navigation, it’s a pia to have to look at your phone and manually type in addresses on the Tesla nav 

Notifications for messages, calls and other apps"
"Gives full blue tooth control over your audio sources, no going to your phone just to change play list, artist, and more.  
  
Siri responds to far more voice commands than any Tesla.  
  
Text messaging support, I was able to respond with voice in my previous car
   
Seriously, a fucking new Corolla does the first two and our Tesla's - NO TESLA does the later. How many voice commands do our cars respond to? We were promised so much but apparently unless Musk needs it in his day to day life we never get it unless he thinks its funny like fart humor and video games - stuff that does not improve the daily drive.
   
I don't want Apple Car Play in my TM3, I want my TM3 to at least be equivalent in blue tooth audio and voice commands to cars I owned FIVE if not TEN years ago.
  
If it keeps going this way I know my next car will not be a Tesla, so in two years there will be a much better selection and Tesla better get their heads out of their asses and lay off the dumb fuck humor and video games. Quality of life improvements. It is illegal in many states to use a hand held device yet it is the only way to just change music play lists or select play by artist and such. 
   
Hell my car cannot even recognize a speed limit sign....  or get the damn automatic high beams to work and if its dark damn if the automatic wipers being actually useful"
[deleted]
"CarPlay just pushes app data processed on the phone.  It wouldn’t “integrate” with Tesla’s UI.  It would literally be a picture in picture box on the screen.

App integration is slowed by Apple’s I distance on how CarPlay works."
I just never had that problem
Its because Tesla Maps use google. Apple Maps use a 1982 Thomasguide.
"I've got MMI currently (3G, no virtual cockpit) but have had some loaners that do. I don't really think AA/CP is an upgrade personally. Audi has done a great job. Now, compared to Sync or whatever the fuck GM uses? Sure, absolutely."
my volt was a gen 2.  I used several different iPhones from 7 to X.  Never had any trouble except when phone was disconnected before carplay could start up - and that was always fixed by a disconnect/wait/reconnect cycle
"Oh please, lets excuse the lack of features on our TM3s by lambasting issues we had with other cars. That is the position of someone who knows they cannot support their side.
   
Look, I had zero issues in my Gen2 with my iPhone 8plus. Guess I was lucky. Just the native Volt display let me change my blue tooth connected phone play lists, I could see within songs, and I could easily deal with SMS while cable connected. From an interface that was years old.  
  
A damn Corolla has better connectivity to phones and responds to more voice commands than any Tesla. What is our excuse?  Hur durr, they use gasoline?"
Pretty cheap assuming they have to install new hardware.
"You could buy a new CarPlay enabled stereo aftermarket for that price; completely absurd.  CarPlay doesn’t open up any new functionality, it just displays the data on a more car-like UI.  Just get a phone clip to have Waze where you want it."
"For me that’s a bargin.  I think I remember at one time Apple Carplay was $2000 option ion some BMW.  Heck, I’d pay $2000 to get a fully integrated Carplay/Android Auto on my Model 3!  Even more to get the seldom seen but known to be available Wireless Carplay. 

Truly, if you have invested any time or money into collecting audio onto your phone - especially if your collection includes the kind of music that is hatd to get on the streaming services - that 465CAD could change your life."
"At least CarPlay has integration with the music on my phone.  The model 3 has a Bluetooth audio connection.

All other parts of the Tesla OS are great, but the music integration is ridiculously lacking."
"yes. text messages! I forgot how much I miss reading / sending text messages over the car’s headset.

Sorry you had a buggy experience.  It never was much of a problem for me."
"I’ve got a PacHy with CarPlay and none of what you mention is an issue. It just works. Maybe early implementations sucked? Seems of all companies if Chrysler can make it work, Tesla can too."
They simply mean that it's hard to live without once you've had it.
but FSD doesn’t work yet.  Carplay worked.  Carplay means learning and investing in ONE and only ONE entertainment system whereever you go.  That’s life changing - knowing the entertainment YOU want is available when you want it AND how you know to access get to it.
"If Tesla had semi-decent Bluetooth capabilities, most people wouldn’t be asking for AA/CP. The low end and several years old Toyota I got as a rental when my Model 3 was in the service center was way better on that front."
"inferior?  Having the choice of 3 in car navigation systems - google, waze or apple is inferior to being locked into 1 closed Tesla system?  Strange use of the word inferior.

I suspect people who can get their audio fix from the streaming services might not understand what having a carefully curated (over a life time) collection of audio on a 256 gigabyte phone is like."
"I like AA a lot. I basically have the Google Assistant on tap. there's smart home integration - so I can control all my smart devices with voice. 

Apps always add support to Android Auto way before they add support to Tesla. 

I have YouTube Premium, can I use GPM/YouTube Music on Tesla? 

I can use Libby app on AA to listen to library audiobooks, can Tesla do that? 

can I ask Tesla assistant to send WhatsApp/SMS/kik messages? 

what's the internet speeds on the Tesla? 4G? when 5G phones are available, it's easier to upgrade to a 5G phone, than a 5G Tesla."
"But, as this thread proves, many people would make a different choice.  Why are you trying to hold everyone back when it would be a pay for upgrade you wouldn’t pay for?"
Tesla’s sucks big time!
It could be a pay for upgrade. You could keep living in the Stone Age while the rest of us evolve.
"I mentione that in a previous comment.

Everyone thinks AC/AA takes over the car’s CPU. IT DOES NOT! It just wants a portion of the screen like the web browser uses."
"You don’t have to plug in wireless Carplay.  

Carplay/Android Auto doesn’t replace the OEM’s built in stuff.  It AUGMENTS the existing platform. Choice is good."
It’s not an either/or situation!  If Tesla just had confidence in their own system they could offer an option to let users choose AC/AA for some apps.  Making it a pay upgrade would make sense (1 time fee not subscription like BMW)
"Apparently there are a lot of car manufacturers who implemented AC/AA poorly.

Here’s what’s suppose to happen when you plug in a phone.  The native infotainment system prompts the user “Device A is connected BT. You plugged in device B. Do you want to switch?” Answer no or don’t answer and the phone is just a phone charging.

If you say yes, all that happens is 1 app in the native system changes its name from Projector to AC or AA.
That’s it!  No take over! No other change until you launch that app.  When you launch the app the native platform doesn’t stop running.  It just provides a screen (or potion of the screen) and a HID to your phone.  Your phone uses the screen like a PC uses a second monitor - it just draws on it.

In a hypothetical model 3 implementation. CA/AA would just be an app in the Launch bar - like the web browser.  Select it and CA/AA would present in a window just like the web browser does now.  The native Tesla system doesn’t go away.  In fact it is still in charge and can make thd CA/AA window go away any time it wants.

NOA wouldn’t use the navigation apps offered by CA/AA. NOA needs a very specific database. And it will still have it without CA/AA knowing anything about it.  The best implementation possible would just let car play send routing suggestions to the native navigation system but even if that didn’t happen the phone could still draw a route on the screen it was given so that a human can use it even if NOA can’t

Apple Carplay/Android Auto is a choice.  That is all.  Just a choice I would be exceedingly happy to pay for.

Other car manufacturers are so prowd of their native infotainment system that they allow their customers to experience a different system on the very same screen.

I wish Tesla had that much pride and confidence in their native infotainment system."
The annual fee is standard BMW bs.  They are the only OEM doing that.  Apple gets its cut but all Apple wants is a one time license fee.  Its just some companies are greedy.  Remember when Verizon charged for bluetooth usage between your computer and your phone?
The music playlist is horrendous without CarPlay.
"CarPlay would be nice, but not necessary in my experience. I’d just like better BT integration. Even my F-150 does BT better, showing how much time left in whatever I’m listening to. If I could just get that I’d be happy."
"It's ok, I was being 100% sarcastic."
This...
Its one of the reasons my next car would be a Bolt. I’ve owned Tesla stock since a day after the IPO and the fact that I would have a second thought about buying one is ridiculous. We have CarPlay in our Honda Civic. It is inexcusable that it isn’t on a M3.
"I drive an 08 wrx, this is my car with an iPad duct taped to the top of the dash"
"From someone living in another democracy, you have bigger issues you guys 😂"
I think it was meant as a smartphone to a “dumb” cell phone
"And to every media company. It’s the fashionable thing.

The centre mounted touch screen is as iconic as the notch. Everyone knows what you’re showing them, and those items are held up as highly desirable displays of wealth or power."
"I highly disagree. 

In your case (doing tasks that are duplicated by an actual employee), an unpaid intership is legal. 

However, most unpaid internships, at least in the US, are totally illegal. If an intern does any work that provides value to the company in any way, the intern must be paid at least minimum wage. Further, paid internships, unless they are Masters or PhD level, typically do not require any industry experience, but will require relevant course work.

My school required that every student have at least one internship to graduate, and the internship had to be paid, because otherwise they viewed it as a job where you didn't actually learn anything meaningful. I have never heard of a student who didn't get at least one paid internship within those four years, and this was a school of over 10,000 students."
"I use Tesla Waze straight on the browser. Don't need it on an app. I've used Android Auto (Chevrolet) and Apple CarPlay (2017 Audi A4) and after using my Model 3, I think both implementations are simply workarounds for crappy in car systems.

Tesla's UI does everything I need and want way better than either of the two implementations.

One thing I love now is the functional browser I set favorites to for various WebApps. Examples Bookmarks:  
* [QTesla] (https://qtes.la/) - (Weather, Waze, News, Stocks)  
* Alternative to above is [TeslaPage](https://teslapage.com/v2.5.1) better for Model S/X UI.  
* [ABetterRoutePlanner](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/)  
* [Spotify / Tesplayer] (https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/bkt665/tesplayer_spotify_remote_for_tesla_browser_works/)  
* Local Movie Theater Time (google search your local theatre name)  
* Yelp for Food suggestions  
* Discord - For all Tesla Reddit chats lol  
* Calculator (google search Calc)  

The only thing it can't do is read/respond to texts easily. But it can do so much more via the browser apps."
Waze is great until some rando map editor can’t figure out how the most edit the map and starts breaking roads all over the place.
"I'm a Waze devotee, and I find it interesting that the Tesla navigation software (Model 3) almost always chooses the same routes as Waze (I'm in Austin - and we have nasty traffic issues as well)."
"As a DC commuter, Tesla's routes are nearly always the same. Waze is distracting in my opinion, almost feels like a video game these days."
I can't use all my Phone's apps within the Car OS.....
Inferior to Tesla web browser UI
"Not to mention you can decide what app to use for what function. I could use Google maps to navigate or Waze. I can listen to music through Google podcast or Google music... All of which is controllable through a nice interface on the touchscreen. Don't get me wrong, I love the interface on the model 3, it has the best phone integration have any car that doesn't have Android auto."
"The bad thing about 3rd party maps routing is that it doesn’t know you have an EV, your current charge level, can’t estimate route energy usage, plan charging stops."
This is all? I understand needing this in a normal car. I wouldn't want it in a Tesla.
For any other car absolutely agree its a god send. Wish Luxury makers would jump in the TouchScreen option versus a stupid knob and dial system.
"5 year olds understand irony, right?"
I may be in the minority here but I don’t need 3 mapping apps and multiple apps that play the same podcasts.  I like having a relatively simple UI with voice commands so I can watch the road.
"You're the only person who provided a real answer to his question. Kudos and respect to you for actually saying what carplay is and does, rather than an irrelevant response like ""I use Waze to navigate"" (which doesn't say anything about CarPlay at all - Waze works on the phone without CarPlay at all)."
I had that down before I had a car with any connectivity 😏
"I guess Teslas aren't for you, buddy. Sorry you made such a bad decision"
Found the BMW shill. Doesn't BMW charge you a subscription fee to use Android Auto/Car play?
I meant it would fit into the UI well in the lower third that is occupied by the radio section now.  It would simply be another card that could occupy that section of the screen when selected in the Tesla UI.
"actually carplay now makes 3 map apps available
apple maps
google maps
waze

I travel to small venues in small towns sometimes I need more than 1 application to find the venue.  Most of the time google gets it right but when it has put me in the wrong parking lot it’s great to switch map apps and get a differrnt guess"
"My Volt was a 2017 (gen 2). I was hoping my experience was rare. I was lucky to get it to work, problem free, once out of every three connections. I've had the experience where it was working flawlessly, I shut the car off, left the phone connected and untouched, turned the car back on several minutes later and it wouldn't connect. It's a mystery. Glad I don't have that problem any more. Still miss some of the functionality, like receiving and sending texts through Siri. That was very nice."
"I had a Volt 2017 where Chevy told me that my phone wasn't supported because it only supported phones up to iPhone 7 🤦‍♂️... I had an iPhone X.

This is the problem when car manufacturers don't give a damn about their software."
"You seem mad. I can't change my actual experience. Also, I did mention I missed some features of CarPlay. Not trying to upset you."
"Many modern cars can't have ""The radio"" replaced because there is no ""Radio"", it's actually about 8 different components spread around the car, and even if you can replace the display unit you usually lose things like steering wheel buttons, backup cam, MFD display in the dashboard/etc. 

How would you replace ""the radio"" in a Tesla? Hint: you can't."
Agreed!  Even without carplay most car’s bluetooth / phone connection has more functionality than Tesla’s
I agree. I miss seeing how long a song has left to play so I know if I am going to stick it out or use one of my skips.
"How about Google Voice, Whatsapp, LINE, Viber, etc. If these can work with the Tesla App to allow integration w the car, that would be even better.

Essentially a Tesla smartphone app integration, kinda like Google Chromecast. This maybe up to the app developers to participate in the integration though."
It was a 2017 GMC Sierra.
I would change Tesla maps and entertainment software to Android Auto is a heart beat.
You can use those all those nav systems via the Tesla web browser.
"Oh they can include it idc, I'm just saying, for people that have never used it, not necessarily everyone likes it"
You can buy a tablet and mount it.
"I agree. And I do like CarPlay, Even my 1999 Isuzu has it (via a 3rd party head unit). It really gets awesome if you have a jailbroken device and use ""CarBridge"", which lets you run ANY app via carplay, including games etc :)"

"I went to a school with 48000 undergrads.

It’s also worth noting that I didn’t say interns should not be paid but if they are it’s likely mostly a charity case as value added surely isn’t significant.  whatever nominal wage an intern does make is far, far less valuable than the experience. Experience = $"
Browser is 100% useless on MCU1. (In fact it's embarrassing and should be removed.) CarPlay eats much less resources on the MCU because it basically just shows redirected display content from your mobile relays back touch events.
"Oh you and your advanced browser. Go to any of those sites in my 2016 Model S and you feel like you’re surfing Web 1.0 with how long it takes.  I hear what you're saying about a full web-based experience but there is a place for applications.  Behind the wheel, I want as few key presses as possible and a UI that is overblown to make quick glances quick and efficient so my eyes can go back to the road. 

Also, Tesla isn’t incentivized you improve that type of experience whereas Apple and google are. As the comment above alluded, I know people who have sold their commuter vehicles solely for car play. When your car is your office, your usage demands change. 

Still, thanks for all the links!  I’ll try them out!"
Waze via browser is nowhere near the real product. Not that useable at all.
"Hey... creator of https://qTes.la here. Sorry about the geolocation on weather/radar being fucked. I need to use a different library or something I think. I'm looking for testers.. ill see if I can give it a shot today.

"That's interesting, the ""You don't need an app, it's available via the browser,"" argument is the same one that Steve Jobs used when the iPhone was originally released.

Remind me how we don't need apps on a smart phone to make the device even smarter?"
sounds great but yelp? seriously?
">I've used Android Auto (Chevrolet) and Apple CarPlay [...] I think both implementations are simply workarounds for crappy in car systems.


>I use Tesla Waze straight on the browser. Don't need it on an app.

:')

Also how do you send your address from your phone to your in-browser Waze map?"
"You know you could just have both, right? The browser and Android Auto

You're literally listing workarounds..."
"First thanks for the links.  Second I mostly agree as far as the Tesla UI, I just want Siri to be a little more responsive for sending texts is all.  Despite that it’s definitely the best and easiest to use UI in any car I’ve driven."
"The ability to read and reply to my text messages is one of the biggest things I love about CarPlay, followed closely by Spotify integration"
Does not have my streaming service or my podcast app built in. Those two things alone are why I want Android Auto.
Tesla’s UI experience is SEVERELY lacking with phone integration. They threw me a BMW while my Tesla was in the shop and realized just how bad it was. I personally hate the music options built in and would WAY rather use my playlists from Spotify. All apps with music should integrate in screen.
Too bad my model 3 doesn't have a browser
"Technically, having to use third party browser apps for literally everything CarPlay could do sounds like a crappy workaround to me. 

No?"
"except no siri or apple music 

lame."
"I meant the essential apps, like maps, apple music, etc."
"Except it's not.

The Tesla UI is great...until you compare it to Android Auto or CarPlay.  Tighter integration with your smartphone is something you won't want to live without once you've had it."
Well a touch screen is much more difficult to use while driving than a bi-directional knob.
"I've been trying to use the Android Auto app on my phone along with my Model 3. I haven't mastered it quite yet, but I like that I'm not completely with Android Auto & can implement it somehow."
"This is true, but I haven’t found it to be too bad in practice on my Bolt EV between the guess-o-meter and looking things up on plugshare."
"It doesn’t replace the Tesla native nav system it just augments it.  You probably wouldn’t be able to use the thitd party nav to start NOA.  It’s just window on the screen.  

Doesn’t any Tesla driver enjoy driving?  If all you got is the Tesla native nav you don’t have “ Avoid Highways”.  When I’m driving for fun the last thing I want to do is suck tailpipe because Tesla keeps routing me on the highway."
"That's why I'm personally excited for in car android, found on the Polestar 2. Google assistant and google maps with range and charging information is going to be a big deal."
"You wouldn't want more features with basically no negative? It gives you access to a lot more functionality and customization. So instead of being stuck with Slacker here in the US you can use the music you want right from the touch screen. There isn't a negative really, just positives."
The irony is that the newer vehicles with attempts at integrating with modern personal computing devices make the actual integration worse.
I may be in the minority here but I don’t need a different UI every place I go.  I like having 1 set of relatively simple apps and voice commands I can use everywhere.  That is what Carplay/Android Auto is all about.
"I never understand the people who decided that playing on your phone by proxy was better than playing on your phone.

I guess it's easier to sell cars with fancy screens than it is to sell cars with an integrated phone mount. I'd absolutely hop ship from my preferred brands and buy a car if it had a clean crisp phone mount with 2A wireless charging."

"You’d see an iOS-like area with app icons for map programs and music apps overlaid on the Model 3 map.  It would look completely out of place.  Waze through CarPlay would look like a picture in picture from a tv, but with a Waze box on top of the Mode 3 map.

People who want CarPlay integration that badly don’t have a firm grasp on what CarPlay is and what it isn’t."
That's how I imagine it could be implemented if they were to do so. The question is if its worth the develop resources. I would certainly pay to have it but I don't see a huge benefit for it....
You mean like a manufacturer who updates Sketchpad instead of fixing their broken phone integration software?
"Agreed; in this case we’re talking about a Mazda, not a Model 3."
Agreed.  My 2012 Prius was able to display playlists.  I can’t even get that.
That is what Apple Carplay is meant to be.
"Hrm, you’d think after 3 years of CarPlay they’d have  it figured out. I wonder how much is Apple and how much is the car company/the specific product team..."
Yes.  Everyone should be able to choose Carplay or Android Auto as an option

What does MCU1 refer to? Older hardware versions?
"The ‘advanced’ browser is still a total POS so don’t feel bad. 

We need apps"
"It goes both ways. Some apps are great, highly optimized, and enhance the experience on a mobile device. Other apps are terrible, laggy, take up valuable space, only get used twice a year, and would be *much* better served by a properly designed mobile website."
"I go to fb website but would never download the app. It shows down my phone, spies on you all the time, etc."
"My takeaway is that people have just gotten used to a certain feature / method of use for carplay or apple play. It would be like if someone took away your phone and gave you an opposite OS phone. Does all the same stuff, but it would be annoying for you to get used to. Makes sense why people are annoyed. Also make sense why Elon decided to not pay extra to include it."
Tesla already has built in APIs for linking navigation routes from browser to the car. ABetterRoutePlanner / ABRP implements this.
"Before I had my Tesla, I would agree that having CarPlay/Android Auto was a firm requirement in my next vehicle. Until you use the Tesla UI, you realize you don't really ""need"" most of the functions offered by the phone apps if your cars infotainment does it all natively pretty well.

They are work arounds....but I don't think a Android/iOS UI would flow very nicely around the Tesla UI TBH and takes away a lot of develop resources in ensuring that it works. 

Now if they did build it, I'd definitely consider using it, but I don't think it offers a lot of value."
I don't understand this... why do you want those things built in when you can just use them on your phone and route the audio to the car via bluetooth?
"If you turn on Autopilot, makes it quite easy to use...."
"Sounds like a pain in the ass for long trips. I hated the guess-o-meter in the Leaf. Tesla's range estimation is much better, always within 5% of the estimate.

Early adopters and EV nerds like us might not mind the extra fiddling around, but I think that converting mass market consumers to EVs requires an easier user experience."
"Does the Bolt nav system take into account Terrain geography yet? I had a Volt (built in Nav), and Spark EV (Bringgo) prior but after using Tesla's nav system it blows every other EV nav system out of the water with only ABRP coming even close (and that I found out is super far off on a recent road trip)."
"I skip highways sometimes on short drives, but on long roadtrips Navigate On Autopilot is great to have during long stretches of boring interstate.

If you leave the interstate Tesla's nav system will reroute you along country roads."
"[There is a demo of the system here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcYFNMyJXFo) Unfortunately it doesn't appear to work very well.

She demonstrates finding a charger along the route which is nice, but it doesn't appear to automatically plan charging stops for you. The list of chargers it found along the route appeared to all be J1772 chargers which would be relatively slow/useless on a roadtrip.

It doesn't appear to show charger availability. She says that an owner would call ahead to reserve a charging station? What?

It is missing a level of EV route planning that Tesla released to customers in 2015."
You can't understand wanting a bigger screen to look at when you're driving? lol. It's not hard.
"Normally I'd want a bigger screen when in the car and only have an ability to glance briefly.

But my mom bought a brand new Honda a few months ago, fresh out of the factory - and the infotainment system is shit. It starts with a resistive touch screen, rather than a decently sensitive capacitive one. Then there's the fact that the screen is huge but it's mostly bezel - there's more than an inch of bezel on each side, it's ridiculous. And it just doesn't connect with her iPhone at all. I've managed to get it to connect once after 30 minutes of fiddling, and it keeps trying to disconnect and attach to any other Bluetooth device it can find.

**And the USB ports can't even charge the phone!** It provides maybe 0.3 amps of power at most, which means my phone can be plugged in and navigating, and it's charging at a slower rate than it is consuming power. 

$29,000 for a car with a touchscreen like a 2009 Garmin, and less charging power than a AA battery."

Not a question. Would definitely be worth it
Doesn't really matter. A ford fusion is just as complicated.
I miss that very much
In fairness I only dealt with GMC over the issue. They were not very helpful. I loved my truck though. I miss it until I take my Tesla out and then I am more than ok.

"I’ve noticed a huge difference between the difficulty of this depending on where you live. In Washington, there are so few non-tesla DCFC stations along I-5 that you had better have carefully planned it.

Along the eastern seaboard routes, such as through MA, CT, NY, NJ, the current buildout density is such that you can play pretty fast and loose with it.

My wife is not about tinkering with EVs, but will plan it online and stop somewhere to get breakfast while charging. She uses most pessimistic estimate (the Bolt gives min/max/likely), and that means she doesn’t really worry a lot about it.

I think once we have even higher station density, it’ll be a non-issue, but how much planning you need varies with where you want to go. You can’t go coast to coast without it, but you can make certain routine trips just fine."

"Tesla has your standard media controls on the steering wheel (volume, next, back, pause/play) for basic bluetooth control and built in streaming services TuneIn (podcasts/internet radio), Slackr (Spotify is better obviouisly). 

Then for further alignment, its possible to build WebAPIs to control your app like what others have done for spotify. Yes its not perfect, but looking at my AndroidAuto, its a great alternative."
">then I have to pick up...

No you don't. You mount your phone somewhere within easy reach. Mine is literally inches from my right hand while I drive.

>...and touch my phone to control those things

... as opposed to reaching over to touch the center console screen? I fail to see the difference. In fact, if you mount your phone on the divider between the seats or on the left of the center console screen, it's *easier* to reach.

"I'm fully aware of the controls on my car and the streaming services offered. I just want 1 of 2 things: either better integration with my smart phone, or a much wider range of in-car apps. It's such a high tech car, it needs more rich integration with other devices/services."
"I've had a car with Android Auto native, and I've had a car without it, using a phone mount and the Android Auto app on autolaunch. I hear what you're saying, but with the Tesla UI being nearly all-inclusive, I'd really prefer not to have to use my phone while driving.

No car has revolutionized an industry as a disruptive force as much as the Model S has.

It truly has ushered in the transition from fossil fuel to battery. With 0 pollution when running.

Simply amazing."
Well deserved.
"I mean without the S, Tesla would have never been able to make the 3 or even exist anymore."

"> It can be argued, as we still are today, that the Tesla Model S wouldn't exist without the Prius. If Toyota hadn't made green cool, the nascent Tesla Motors—founded one year before the second-generation Prius was named our 2004 Car of the Year—might never have sold an electrified Lotus, much less create a new car that would revolutionize an industry.

I'm not so sure I can agree with that one. I've never met anyone that ever thought a Prius was ""cool"", and I'm pretty sure plenty of people would've still thought the OG Roadster was cool without the Prius having existed."
Cross post to /r/cars?
"Wow, so this is pretty big right?"
Just the beginning of the many many awards lined up for Tesla.
I test drove one of these just to try out the Ludicrous mode. Holy fucking hell they weren’t kidding!
"OMG, the kiss of death. Some pretty awful cars have won the Motor Trend Car of the Year award."
"I am delighted for Tesla and the Model S.  As a Model 3 owner, I don’t personally are for the Model S, but it was a clear game changer whose impact hasn’t fully been felt by a long shot.

With all of that said, I think the Caravan is the better choice.  The Caravan invented a whole new class of vehicle!  That’s quite a feat!  Again, not taking anything away from the Model S, but it didn’t create a wholly new vehicle type that has lived on."
Yes we'll deserved!
This is huge. Gratz
Great article.
That's amazing.
BANZAI !!!!
I can’t think of any other car that has retractable door handles. Let alone ones that deploy when the driver approaches. I’d say it’s unique?
"I would love a Model S, but fuck they’re expensive. Anyone want to give me $150,000CAD?"
"I have the 2013 Model S P85+(Voltron)...My wife has a 2018 Model3 LR(Pearl). I absolutely LOVE driving my car...It is IMHO the ultimate driver's car(dat takeoff!!). That being said, the Model 3 is a damn close 2nd. I like her model 3 interior and tech better, but as an everyday around town driver, I still prefer the Model S."
did the 2013 Tesla win the 2019 Car of the Year ?
"So awards only hold credibility when a Tesla wins around here ?

I was told that because Tesla didn’t pay for ads they didn’t win awards and that any car other than a Tesla that wins is strictly because of buying it"
"The big question is why they are showing a 2014/2015 model S and not a 2013? The S pictured could not have been made in 2013 as it has gen 1 autopilot hardware which did not start shipping on the model S until November of 2014...

Excuse me while I readjust my extremely nerdy glasses :-)"
"No. You can clearly see the AP1 camera on top so it’s  clearly a 2015 Model S winning the 2019 car of the year. 

Congrats Motor Trend. You truly are experts."
"My initial impulse is to say the Model 3 is more of a game changer than the S but when I think it through the S is clearly the change agent for exactly the reasons quoted here. The Model 3 is just evidence proving the game has been changed by the Model S.

Bravo, Tesla!"
Just wait until the roadster comes out...
"This is not just recondition from automobile journalist like a Nissan GTR or some Alfa Romeo.  
The Model S is also a commercial success."

It's basically an award for Car of the Last 70 Years so a pretty freaking huge honor.
"This was kind of a ""Tournament of Champions"" if you will.  If you took the cars who won all of their various Car/Truck/Boat/Bike of the Year Awards and put them head to head which would be the best / most important?"
"The same reason Chevy Bel Air was a contender, this was a competition between previous winners from past decades.

I understand the reason they chose the S and obviously I'm not mad but I expected Bel Air to win.  They helped kick off America's love of cars, that eventually became the muscle car, that eventually became my Tesla."
"ultimate car of the year.  they took all their cars of the year for a given decade and picked a car of the decade.  then they pitched those cars against each other and picked the ultimate car of the year.  The S was their car of the year for 2013, was picked as car of the decade for the 2010s, then picked as ultimate car of the year compared to their other decade picks.  It was picked mainly because its the most influential car of the past 70 years, ushering in the electric car era.

[Their 2019 car of the year is the Genesis G70.](https://www.motortrend.com/news/genesis-g70-2019-car-of-the-year/)"
"2019 car of the year is Genesis g70. 2013 model s is ""ultimate car of the year"" choosing from all car of the year winners over past 70 years"
"Like others explained this was over the last 70 years, but I wanted to add that you don't need to worry, Model 3 went and got Car of the Year 2019 for the team ;)"
"Really happy to see Model S getting some much deserved attention.

\-Model S owner"
"Mine too.   140,000 miles and still kicking ass."
"Well I mean, Tesla did pay them to help develop the Model 3s track mode. So..."
Volvo seems to be going in that direction at least. They have OTA updates and the new design language found in the Polestar definitely has [some Tesla-like minimalism](https://article.images.consumerreports.org/prod/content/dam/CRO%20Images%202019/Cars/February/CR-Cars-Inline-Polestar-2-int-2-19) going for it.
"I got stuck there too. In short, no-one. They're doing bits of OTA updates but still far from the full stack. They need to vertical integrate first.."
"Supposedly the I-Pace, but they're OTA that you can only get by going, uh, into a dealership."
I recently updated my Honda motorcycle’s nav system with a download onto a USB key. No need to go to the dealer.
I think there's an All Electric VW Bus in the works that's like this?
Jeep had this.  https://youtu.be/54vNtCg-iXs
"On the cars sub yesterday lots of people were saying the Prius deserved it over the S. Ugh. When the Prius came out you could have also gotten a base-model Civic for a lot less with only marginally worse gas mileage. It was an underwhelming, incremental step that ushered in an era of hybrid vehicles that could have higher price tags on them, a bit better efficiency and that was about it.

The S won because it was alltogether revolutionary."
"It was cool though, if not just for certain group of people. The Civic hybrid sold terribly because the hybrid drivers back then *wanted* others to know they drive a hybrid, thus why Prius’s weird styling was successful.

Remember as much as people make fun of Prius now, at one point it was *the cool car* to own for certain groups. Larry Page from Google had one, so did [many Hollywood stars](https://m.ranker.com/list/celebrities-who-drive-prius/celebrity-lists).

It was seen as the antithesis to the Hummer, which made it super lame to some, and super cool to others."
"I’m surprised MotorTrend said this. It’s pretty widely known that Tesla wouldn’t have started if not for the GM EV1 and the shitty way that GM discontinued it. The EV1 proved that there was a market for BEVs. Tesla still would have sold a ton of roadsters even if there was no Prius.

Not that I dislike the Prius. The transmission design alone makes the Prius a cool car to me."
2004 Hybrids were stigmatized with hippie up in your face enviroentalists. Politics of the time automatically discounted these people as nuts. Bush and rural America made fun of Gore for being an anti American global warming yuppie out to shut down the big 3 car manufacturers. If that hadn't been the political climate of the time EVs and hybrids would have skyrocketed in sales around the mid 2000s when gas got expensive. And then in 2012/2013 again when gas hit $5/gallon.
"“It could be argued” 
But it shouldn’t. Gas prices hitting $4  a gallon,  trillions of dollars, and countless lives spent on war, made the Prius acceptable. It was only developed in order to be a compliance car the fact it succeeded was not because it was ‘cool’ and being ‘cool’ was probably against its design intention. Get real motor trend.  Who edited this dribble."
The Prius is so far from cool....Someone who doesn't care about saving the environment is not buying a Prius. The S is a cool and fast car that just so happens to save the environment.
"The Prius was the car that convinced me I didn’t want electric. The Prius was designed by a car manufacture to keep normal people buying the gas powered engines. The Prius buyer was telling the world, “my principles are more important than my comfort or dignity.” The Prius set the standard that EVs had to be ugly, impractical, undesirable, slow.

And then I test drove a Model S."

"You can argue the Beetle and the Model T both did, in their eras. At least in the sense of bringing transportation to millions of people. The Model T arguably created the automotive revolution in the first place, and if we're having that kind of conversation it speaks to how revolutionary the S \*may\* be seen decades from now."
Back around 2002 or so the Prius was certainly seen as a cool car.  I can distinctly remember being excited to see one on the road and remember watching celebrities at the Oscars pull up to the red carpet in one instead of the traditional black limo.  IMO they failed to expand on their early advantage. It took modders creating their own plug-in versions of the Prius before Toyota even considered doing it themselves.
"I would argue the beginning was a few years ago, when they started winning a bunch of awards."
"Aside from the minimalist dashboard, ultra efficient drive motors and camera / self driving hardware and online software updates . . ."
There were vans before the Caravan.  There weren't electric cars that changed the way society thought about electric cars before the Tesla.
Tesla in general is the most important thing to happen to the motor industry in a hell of a long time. This award shows that
"> it didn’t create a wholly new vehicle type that has lived on.

Um, yes it did. Just because it looks like a sedan doesn't mean it isn't a whole new vehicle type. It's the first successful *electric sedan*. It *created* today's market for EVs, in the same way that the Caravan created today's market for minivans."
"If the only thing you do is read the headline, you're not going to learn anything. This award is ""The Best Car of the Year out of All MotorTrend Cars of the Year for the last 70 Years""."
[deleted]
"I think of the Model S as more of an Revolution - the first ever bottom-up long range EV produced - and the Model 3 as an Evolution - making EVs more accessible and at higher volumes.

Edit: ""bottom-up"""
The Model S proved it could be done. The Model 3 shows how best to do it.
Also the Model 3 is not eligible as it did not win a prior MT COTY.
S changed the game that 3 is now playing.
"The Model S was the start, the model 3 is the growth."
Why is the 3 more so? Just because of price point?
"Yeah, well at $250k, it's not near as much of a gauntlet throw down, moon shot as the S was in 2013. No doubt, the new Roadster will be epic, but it is a prestige model. The S was approachable and continues to cause luxury brands a headache they still can't reach. Still love our 2013 S 60 as much as the day we brought it home."
"From the wikipedia article itself:
> [Motor Trend's independent test of the Porsche 918 claims that with a 2.4 seconds 0-60 mph \(97 km/h\) time...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_918_Spyder#Specifications)

The numbers are based on MotorTrend's real world tests, not manufacturer's numbers.

Also, no one likes edits where OP cries about downvotes. They're just downvotes."
[The article was talking about a specific test linked right in the text](https://www.motortrend.com/news/a-closer-look-at-the-2017-tesla-model-s-p100d-ludicrous-acceleration-run/). If you want to debate that take it up within Motor Trend.
"Only 918 cars produced. It meets the criteria of the Wikipedia page, but that’s not many cars. Certainly debatable."
"shots fired at the legacy automakers, burns harder than the planet"
"Really happy to see Model S getting some much deserved attention.

\-15 year old ICE owner"
"Really wish people would marvel at the falcon X-wing.  
 .

"Oh mines a p85 too! Love it. Green 💚

Edit but 75k miles I’m impressed with your mileage!"
True true
"Honestly that doesn't mean they're biased, it means Tesla realized that if they want to improve the handling of their car on a track they should probably go to people that drive road cars on the track all the time and right reviews about what they like and don't like about it. It's that last part that's really important. Lots of people can drive a car and say ""Hey this feels nice"" or ""this feels like shit"" but few can accurately articulate what they like and don't like about the experience. 

And sure Track mode likely got a great review from Motortrend, but anyone that helps develop something like that would probably be happy with the end result. The fact so many others agreed with them shows that they aren't being inherently biased."
"They DID NOT pay us to help develop the Model 3's track mode.
Had no idea that was a widely-accepted myth."
Lol. USB.
"We used to call putting files on a floppy then walking it over to a different computer ""sneaker net."" I suppose mailing a USB instead of OTA would be ... I dunno ... ""dress shoes net""?"
They could have also made the Prius not look dumb as fuck.
"And 15 years later legacy automakers are still touting hybrids coming down the pipe as evidence of them electrifying. For all the handwringing over Tesla stock, I can’t believe how the market tolerates capital expenditures on developing hybrid passenger cars."
/r/cars is very anti Tesla in general.
"I will say this: newer hybrids really do have a massive MPG gap on standard ICE cars. Before my 3, I had a Hyundai Ioniq, and it more than lived up to its EPA estimated 60+MPG on the regular. Nobody I've met who drove another hybrid before 2017 could compare. That's no doubt changed in the past few years but at least it's ""progress"" so-to-speak."
"Yeah, I dunno what they're on about. The Prius has been out for over 20 years. It's just now that automakers are aggressively pushing to offer lots of hybrid options... as part of their increased ""electrification"" in response to BEVs like the Model S."
The Civic Hybrid's IMA system was also incredibly inferior to Toyota's HSD. There's a reason Honda ditched IMA and is now doing an awesome serial hybrid system that one-ups Toyota's HSD.
Hollywood was likely doing it for the social impact rather than actually caring. I was young when it came out so maybe I am wrong.
I love me some prius transmission love. Only automatic I'll drive.
A better reason would be because it was a good car. It was and is a far cry from good looking. Remember Honda’s version? Lol thing was terrible
"> Who edited this *dribble*.

Oh, the *irony!*"
"It absolutely was “cool”, and it looking different played a big role in the image of that car.

People here don’t remember that at one point it was absolutely cool to own a Prius amongst certain social circles, such as the Hollywood elites and Silicon Valley tech billionaires. Larry Page had one, and so did many Hollywood movie stars. Being “green conscious” absolutely carried a lot of social credit for certain groups."
"Yes. People say good on you for saving the planet! And while I consider myself an environmentalist, my other options other than the model 3 were a Jeep gladiator, grand Cherokee, 4Runner, or a Land Rover. 

I’m used to bigger cars as I had my previous suv for 11years. The car being better for the environment is a plus but I still would have bought it if it ran on gas to be honest."
"Whatever comment Elon Musk makes on any ""refresh"" or improvement or whatever is basically worthless information. He can't say yes or maybe no matter what. Sales would plunge and they don't want that... If something like this will happen it will be like ""Oh btw the S and X now have a new interior order it now"""
"I'm hoping by ""anytime soon"" he means the next 3-6 months.

The longer it is, the better for me anyways, since I'd be tempted to buy when it came"
"Henry Ford creating the ""middle class"" that could now afford his cars didn't hurt, either.

""One of Ford’s most astonishing moves, to combat high turnover and absenteeism caused by assembly line monotony, was to double the minimum daily wage to $5 and cut daily working hours from nine to eight. His employees rejoiced, and the high turnover disappeared almost overnight. The industrial world was shocked, and other car makers condemned Ford’s move as cutting into profits—but followed suit."""
"Don't get me wrong, the Model S is/was a huge leap forward in automotive technology.  Maybe it's just a matter of the Caravan not being a very exciting car to drive, but rather a game changing functional vehicle that created a new class... The Model S was not just a revolution in terms of technology, but also performed amazingly.

&#x200B;

As for self-driving tech, I'm not sure you can really give that to the 2013 Model S.  Obviously some of the pieces were in place, but it seems to me that much of that innovation happened slowly and steadily over the past 6 years."
"There were electric cars before Tesla (shit, there were Tesla’s before Model S).  Yes, there were vans, but they weren’t in every suburban driveway until the Caravan... it created a whole new segment.  

Tesla was a giant leap forward for Electric cars and what they were capable of being... minivan created a whole new segment of automobile."
I don’t disagree... I’d say the hell of a long time starts after the Caravan was introduced.
"Well... I have to take exception here... The minivan was and is a wholly new segment of the automotive industry... successful or otherwise.  The Model S was far from the first electric sedan or electric vehicle.  It was a big leap forward in terms of technology, performance, liveability, etc. but that's not the same as inventing a new class of vehicle.  Tesla took 4 steps forward in the EV space, but they didn't invent it.  Vast improvements in a defined space is not the same as carving out a new space.  Not saying one is always better than the other, but they are demonstrably different achievements."
So then give the 2015 car of the year if that's the imagery they want to feature
"""The model 3 is the model T for the EV"""
"Model 3 also didn't win Car of the Year, therefore doesn't qualify....I think"
"Not just that, but the first one that looks like a normal car. I don’t understand why auto companies still insist on making their EVs look like stupid toasters. Who the fuck wants to buy that?"
Good way to put it!
Well observed
It's now the minimum standard and nobody else can even do that yet.
The model 3 showed how to bring it to the masses (somewhat). The s/x are still superior cars.
[deleted]
What beat out the Model 3 for car of the year?
"The Model S was the original iPhone, the Model 3 was the iPhone 3GS."
"Yeah, and the higher sales. It's a huge reason EVs are now 2% of cars on the road when they were just 1% last year"
Right. This award was less about any one car's amazing specs but rather how much of an impact it has had on the industry.
"It kind of is, though. Just at a much higher price bracket. The new roadster, on paper, out-performs $2 million dollar sports cars."
"Curious, how does it hold up 6/7 years later?"
$200k.

">burns harder than the planet

Ouch!"
"Or possibly the car that gets Motor Trend the most clicks to their site. There is a reason no one is reporting on this other than Motor Trend and EV sites. I mean it is neat and if I were choosing the most influential car (assuming no SUVs), the Tesla Model S would be at the very top of the list, but this is not the big deal that many are making it out to be."
"Kind of odd to me as legacy automakers developed most of the tech that was able to go into a Model S. The only differentiation is that the Model S has an electric drive train. All the other mechanical and electrical components and technology can be found everywhere else. Tesla paid Motortrend for their Model 3 track development, so I wouldn't be surprised if there is pandering.

Before the downvoting, it's the same exact argument this sub makes when the Tesla loses in a road comparison."
"Wait, are you saying you're 15 years old, or your car is? ;)"
Mine is the same as the one in the video - but green was an awesome color!  Too bad the color choices are so limited now.  I guess that’s why the wrap industry exists.
Yeah Russia paid for the GOP to win but that doesn’t mean the GOP is biased or anything
"No kidding. The styling screams ""This is what we thought the hippies wanted. Happy now?"""
"That would have been a terrible strategy back then. Look at what happened to the Civic hybrid. It sold terribly despite having awesome efficiency because people wanted their hybrids to look differently. It was a badge of “green” that people wanted. There is a reason why Hollywood stars went out of their way buying Prius even though money wasn’t an issue for any of them.

Tesla doesn’t have this issue because *all* Tesla are EVs."
It should have been named the Galileo 7
I think the Prius is 100% responsible for rolling coal
"I think Tesla is polarizing in general.

It's easy to take it's shortcomings and blow them out of proportion.

It's also easy for those who attempt to elevate the Tesla to forget about it's shortcomings.

The truth is that it's a car that was and is revolutionary, yet the company itself is run more like a technology company than a car company. 

And there are legitimate criticisms for the car. Part lead times are staggeringly long, and there are specific parts that seem to have endless issues. Promises are a crapshoot, and delivery dates seem to be a mere suggestion.

Yet, deep at the core of the product, there is something special that no other car has. It wasn't designed to a price point like so many other cars. It wasn't designed to fill a set of requirements laid out by a marketing analyst. It wasn't designed by a company; it was designed by visionaries. 

It was built to be the best damn electric car you could build. And they've achieved that goal."
"I think most people who hate on Tesla has never driven, or even sat in one. Someone needs to sit them down and make them eat their vegetables."
It was a status symbol to show you cared about the environment. Whether you did or not was irrelevant but as that movement was growing in popularity with the Celebrities of the day it was important to them to buy and drive a prius around town.
"What?

WTF do you think ""social impact"" is?  It's caring and showing that caring about the environment is cool.  Your comment makes absolutely no sense."
"The funny thing about it is that the first gen insight was terrible looking at the time. And now it's desirable simply because its so unique, so 90s/00s, and still to this day returns crazy mpg numbers."
"My take is that toyota paved the way to compliance cars being a thing, Tesla would have been created and successful regardless.  Motor trend just couldn’t resist fellating themselves and toyota for their past car of the year choices."
"Yeah, they're not saying the Prius was a fun car to drive or sexy and that's what made it cool. But it's undeniable that it was a status symbol as being EcoFriendly which was important to a lot of the celebrities of the time. Go watch old Top Gear episodes and Every time Jeremy Clarkson is interviewing someone that lives in Hollywood he asks them if they have a Prius and almost all say yes."
"I believe it was diCaprio who made the prius hip to hollywood A listers when he owned one and made the global warming documentary 11th hour in 07. It just happened to be the most arguable hippy car u could get back then.

The real revolution was the gm EV1. People genuinely liked the car for it being an amazing car vs preconceived notions of saving the planet and being up there with the smug elite."
"There won’t be a refresh for a long while. When Musk says something people want is coming soon, it’s years away. He literally said nothing anytime soon and you are thinking it’s 3-6mo? Right...."
"Well said.

Crazy me, I think the 2013 “S” is more attractive than the 2019 duck bill one. But that’s just me.

I drive a $5k used 2019 Rio right now. 
But there’s a Tesla in my future."
Minivans came and went though. They got replaced by SUVs. The Minivan was more of a 90s to early 2000s fad than a revolutionary automobile.
"I disagree for one reason: NO ONE, consumer or manufacturer (except Nissan), was taking EVs seriously before the Model S. Yes, EVs existed, but they weren't ""real cars"", at least not in the eyes of the general public, and certainly not in the eyes of car industry execs.

If the Model S had never existed, there would still not be any significant market for EVs today."

"Clara Ford apparently wouldn’t drive the Model T. She stuck to her electric car instead, a 1914 Detroit Electric."
"Yep, you're right."
I’ll just leave this here https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/tesla/model-3/107363/car-of-the-year-2019-tesla-model-3
"psst ...

&#x200B;

They don't want to sell them.    They want to prove that nobody wants to buy electrics so they can stop making them."
"Leaving behind conspiracy theories I'd say it comes down to a massive failure of imagination. For a long time EV = some new way to do economy cars. So, the ""futuristic"" designs you got looked more like a futuristic Chevette."
"There are quite a few things better about the 3 than the S/X. 

And I say that as someone who prefers the S."
"I'm speaking about how to best design and build an EV. Lessons were learned on how to better integrate the components together, make them more robust, easier to assemble... The stuff engineers think about, not the owners."
">The s/x are still superior cars.

That's adorable.  

I wouldn't trade my LR RWD 3 for a P100D, unless it was to immediately sell/trade the P100D away and buy another Model 3.  The 3 is, for *my uses and lifestyle*, the far far far better car.   The few things the S is better at are minor, or of no concern to me, or outweighed by the things it sucks at."
"As overall cars perhaps, but from a technological standpoint the 3 is arguably the better *EV*.

Due to it's better battery design, especially the cooling system, but also the cells themselves and battery management system, it can sustain higher charge and discharge rates.

Combined this with the 3's higher efficiency, and this results in considerably faster real world charging, and a higher sustained top speed. This has improved somewhat with raven, but the S and X still lag behind.

The 3 also handles better and is safer according to both the NHTSA and Euro NCAP. Additionally there the anecdotal evidence that despite now existing in comparable numbers to the Model S, there has yet to be a single reported Model 3 fire. 

Not that I mean to imply the S and X are unsafe in anyway. Compared to ICE cars they're excellent, it's just that the 3 appears to be even more excellent in this regard."
Ultimate as in technological functionality. How it looks will always be subject to opinion.
Giulia.
"Exactly.  Nobody cares or remembers.

They picked the wrong car."
"I don't think that is a fair comparison. First Iphone was only superior in interface + design (amazing stuff) with other phones being available with superior features, capabilities, and arguably hardware. I felt like I was downgrading in many ways going from a windows Mobile device to iphone (worse camera, no video call, no tether, went from 3g down to Edge only and I'm sure other downgrades as well)

The Model S as far as I'm aware was at introduction by far the best EV in terms of range, power, space, safety and arguably design / interface as well. I felt like I  only gained when upgrading from my previous EV's to Tesla. (except efficiency)

&#x200B;

I'm a first year owner of both the IPhone (I've had most of them) and Model S (only 1 Tesla so far 2012 P85) for reference."
Except that iphones are terrible while Teslas are actually good.
"The roadster has incredible performance, but it's not something that is driven every day to and from work, or other daily living, like the Model S is.  The 2013 Model S was much more of a gauntlet throw down against other manufacturers to step up and start making capable EVs that don't skimp on performance, luxury, or range (because it wasn't a low end underpowered low range city car, nor was it some boutique car that isn't a realistic primary car, and it was better in many ways than luxury ICE cars)"
"Actually, surprisingly well, for a luxury car. Tesla covered the drive unit replacements (2), most problems have been recalls, and the only major issue has been that the center console/media control unit died last week. She's in the shop today for it. And even more surprising is that it's on the original 12v still. I've never had a car battery last that long! Just to be sure, we're replacing it while she's in for the console problem. We bought the extended warranty and hopefully that will cover the console repair. Tires, of course, have been like candy on her. She's on her fourth set as of last December. 71k on the odo as my husband's daily driver. Easily the most enjoyable vehicle we've ever owned."
Till you add options.

It's worth reading the article. They didn't just award it for the drivetrain.
"Not so sure that’s the only differentiation. Where else do you find retracting doorhandles, a massive touch screen, and the ability to press park and walk away?"

And made it easy for macho-conservatives to blast vehicle-environmentalism with sissy styling and weak performance.
"To add on to your points, the MT article here says in no uncertain terms that the Model S being an electric car isn't what's so revolutionary, it's how much it (and Tesla) are causing the auto industry to change. Slowly...extremely slowly...and kicking and screaming...but the change IS happening."

You don’t live in the suburbs if you think that’s true.
"And again, I’ll point out that the Minivan didn’t exist AT ALL before the Caravan was introduced.  Not just taking it seriously... it didn’t exist."
What does that have to do with anything? They gave the 201**3** Model S COTY and used images of the 2015. Should have been the 2015 Model S to win (which is clearly different from the 2013) if that's the images they wanted to use for it.
Wasn't that because in those times that was the lady like thing to do? Because you didn't have to get all greasy

"Sure, but theres also quite a few things better about the s/x than the 3. The 3, where it is better, is better by virtue of the evolution of the company (finding out better ways to do things, becoming more efficient, etc...) but the car is not designed to be better per se. The s/x are just one refresh away (not saying that its happening soon) from leapfrogging the 3 in every advantage it has, and given that the 3 is already ""good enough"" it makes sense to focus on improving what they can on the s/x, even if that just means bringing it up to parity with the 3 where it current is a gen behind."
what are they?
"Ok

I didn’t say everyone will universally like the s/x better, but that when taken as a whole it’s a better car. For some the s/x are too big or handle differently or whatever, it doesn’t make them “worse” just different in ways you don’t like."

I read and I don’t agree with their assessment and I think it is pandering. Having a keyless feature isn’t really unique. Having a touch l screen isn’t either. Most automobile control systems are all electrical also. Traditional manufacturers developed the tech that Tesla rides on.
"Autopilot, over the air updates, supercharger network..."
"Retracting tech in not unique and I wouldn't consider it special. Cars have had retracting spoilers  and components for while now. A touch screen isn't innovative. Press park and walking away isn't innovative either. It's just taking advantage of the EV drive train not having moving parts when stationary. Car have had keyless FOBs for a while with remote starts, proximity sensors, keyless entry and push button start."
I’ve driven a Model S. Lol
My first car was two years older than me
"fancy, driving a car younger than yourself"
Duuuude...too soon.
215  mi rated range at 90% SoC. Stable for a year.  Down from 235 new.  So a loss of less than 10%.   How’s yours?

" Compliance with fuel efficiency standards. They build it to comply with the laws,  not to be appealing.  The fact it became popular, I believe was a bug not a feature."
"2009, bought gently used back in Oct."
I actually do live in the suburbs. I also [know that it is true due to statistical data.](https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2018/08/americas-minivan-market-still-hasnt-reached-the-bottom-of-the-barrel-but-its-nearly-there/)
The crank was the problem. Electric starters were only on Cadillacs
what's better about the s/x than 3?
"Amazing how people can have different opinions on stuff, isn't it?"

I 'm pretty sure I can't just jump off a building and subjective my way into flying into orbit.
I've yet to ever even see a Julia Gulia out on the road much less know anyone who drives one to tell me why it is so great. I'm pretty sure no one knows about it anymore.
They also said the first iPhone. I'm pretty sure they sold 0 of those in 2018.
"1: Their market share is around 10%, not 87%
https://www.statista.com/statistics/216459/global-market-share-of-apple-iphone/

2: Something can be popular and bad simultaneously.  Just because a lot of people pay for an overpriced and inferior product doesn't make it good.  One company can have better marketing and be more well known and be more successful than another company that has a better and less expensive product, which is less well known.  Popularity of a product doesn't automatically mean it's better.  They just have a lot of none tech savvy customers who are buying a brand name.  A non-phone example would be Harley Davidson.  Years behind the competition technology wise, overpriced compared to the competition, but still has people buying their products because of the brand name that people recognize and some people like.

3: I HATE it when people compare them to Tesla.  Tesla is a years AHEAD of the competition and competitively priced.  Apple is years BEHIND the competition (often 3 years or so, it varies depending on what aspect you focus on) and is MORE expensive than the competition....If I had to come up with a car equivalent, it'd be something like a Fiskar Karma, if they were still around and more popular.  More expensive than a Tesla, but a worse car by most objective standards."

"Nah, he drives like a grandmother on his commute these days. I'm the one who rides the S hard. Truthfully tho, the original OE Goodyear's were SHITE as we barely got 11k out of them. You've got to rotate the tires frequently on this rwd beast and keep it in alignment, front and rear. The last set we we're lax on the rotation so we got less mileage on them."
"Keyless entry - common

Keyless/buttonless start - Tesla only (Apparently)

Touchscreen - common

Touchscreen that doesn't suck - Tesla only (seriously though, I have yet to see a competitor that has an interface that isn't locked behind several menus or which doesn't use small buttons or anything else that's poor UI - with the possible exception of android auto/CarPlay, which themselves still don't control the car's features)

>	Traditional manufacturers developed the tech that Tesla rides on.

That's... kind of missing the point. You could say that about literally any technology ever. Everything is based on what came before it. What Tesla did was take existing technology and combine/use it in a new and superior way. 

The article is looking for cars that created a turning point in the industry, that act as comparison points for others that follow. The model S still manages to be the flagship of the EVs (which is not necessarily a huge bar to jump over). But it is also a flagship with acceleration, UI design, autopilot, and wireless updates (plus, in my personal esteem, cargo space). It's the combination of all those things that makes it stand apart."
Using location to automatically raise the car so you don’t bang your door on the curb....
"I can’t think of any other car that has retractable door handles. Let alone ones that deploy when the driver approaches. I’d say it’s unique, no? But anyway, point taken. Let’s agree that you find nothing innovative or unique about your Tesla and I find mine to be a masterpiece of technology and innovation."
"> A touch screen isn't innovative.

Yes it is, the way Tesla is doing it at least. Show me one other car in which the infotainment system isn't total cancer. Show me one other car that can update its software and firmware over the air like a Tesla. Show me one other car that actually gets features and gets better after you bought it.

That's not an EV-specific feature, you could have a gasoline powertrain and give the same quality of in-car experience as a Tesla. Yet no one else does."
Don't most people?
My model S is only 3 years old. I’m on my 30s lol

That's awesome. Mine is only 3 years old / 23k miles but about 5% loss. 225/236ish (can't recall exactly). But that seems to map what is reported. Your # makes me hopeful my 2016 is a long term vehicle.

"I've bought a lot of ebook readers over the years. I still currently have, enjoy, and occasionally still buy books.

"I'd say 500k units per year for the past 10 years is far from a dying fad.  Sure, it's a large departure from the 90's and early 2000's, but I don't think we'll see Minivans go away anytime soon.

To be clear, I'm not arguing Minivan > Tesla Model S... I'm just saying the Minivan was a more singularly impactful change to the Automotive Industry than the Model S is/was.  Even if the Model S helps usher in a new normal with Electric Cars, it is still an incremental step along a continuum whereas the Minivan represented a step-shift creating a new class of vehicle."

"87% of the profit is not 87% of the market. Apple makes a lot of money on iPhones. Lots of Android phones are being sold at very low profit margins. If Apple is making $300 pure profit on each phone, and most Androids are sold with only $30 profit, it's easy to see how you could get 87% of all profits worldwide with a much smaller marketshare."
Your emotions don’t determine the success of a product. Perhaps keep your Apple hate off the Tesla forum? And my source which I googled just like you said what it said. Yours may have been unit shipment. Mine may have been revenue. I don’t really give a shit.
"A keyless buttonless start isn’t anything be impressed about. It uses an advantage of not having any moving parts while stationary. It activated based on proximity which is tech that has existed. 
In the general market for a while, tacking on an iPad screen has been considered tacky. Plenty of cars have decent user interfaces with their touch screens. While Tesla having an iPad like experience with the screen, it isn’t anything impressive.  But a point that the article brings up is everything being controlled electronically, all cars now forever ago have had the majority of its controls electronically. 
Traditional manufacturers have R&D teams to develop tech we see today. Toyota had magnetic ride, Mitsubishi developed the first adaptive cruise control back in ‘92. There is nothing within a Tesla that warrants it being the best automotive development in 70s years. Far from it."
I appreciate that he didn’t try to explain why his favourite car was a bigger advent for cars everywhere. It was probably the Prius.

"A touchscreen isn’t innovative just because it has a response quality of an iPad. Also, the lack of tactile feel can be distracting and put the driver in danger. 
GM has had over the air 3G software update a while back. They are in 4G now. Again, other companies used this type of feature before. It’s not a Tesla innovation. 
Regarding features, I can hardly call it getting better anything special. They released a product with a bunch of incomplete capabilities. If they had everything flushed out from initial release, this wouldn’t be a talking point. Most automakers have their features flushed out before release."

"When gasoline costs $50/gal and there are no stations selling it within driving range, only wealthy collectors will own ICE vehicles.  And they'll have to trailer them behind their EV to the private tracks that still permit driving them.

"I never made the mistake of buying any ebooks from Microsoft, but you saw that [their books all stopped working](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4497396/books-in-microsoft-store-faq), right?"
"Right,  I agree. But the styling  was the half assed measure. It didn’t have to be awful, I know that is subjective,  but at some point we can say there is consensus, the thing looks like a wedge of cheese with with hubcaps. Perhaps only rivaled by the painfully awful style of the nissan leaf. They are like the bowtie of cars, they say don’t worry about me, I’m impotent.  I am glad I no longer have to be embarrassed to roll up in a zero emission car."
"You say that but fail to acknowledge that the segment dried up and doesn't have a lasting impact on automobiles today. The electric car segment will definitely continue to grow and be shaped thanks to Tesla and the Model S. It was a singular paradigm shift in what an electric car could be. Minivan was an evolution of the Van which had been around for decades. The 1996 Caravan was just the peak evolution of minivan. It wasn't the first or the last, just finally got all the things right that made a minivan the best version of itself.    It also was just a fad that got traded for the SUV. To even compete with the Model S the other car must have a singular start point like the Bel Air. There was nothing else like it at the time. Minivans had already been around. So if we are talking about this within the limitations of C&D then the Caravan itself shouldn't win out overall."
Dude they sold 11000 last year in the entire US. There's nowhere I can go where I'm gonna find more Giulias than Model 3s
"I mean, that  just supports my notion that they're a ripoff and an inferior product for the money.  If one phone takes $180 to make and is sold for $1,000 and another costs $180 to make and is sold for $250, I'll take option 2.  Them making more profit per phone is actually exactly what I'd expect, since they're selling worse phones for more money than some other manufacturers (not saying EVERY android phone ever is a good phone)......but yeah, nothing there is surprising and just supports what I thought all along."
"I never said they weren't successful.  I agree that Apple is successful.  The iphone is a very successful product, despite being overpriced and inferior to many alternatives.  I won't say it's not a successful product though."
You make excellent points however I don’t think there are many car companies that have made a decent user interface.  I think the problem is after using it you get used to it and just say “Yeah it’s pretty good”. My experiences have only been with American car companies and Audi.  Most have been garbage but you get used to them.

"Measles isn't as bad as...

"I'm seeing a lot of comments by ""enthusiasts"" saying they'd like to get an EV for a daily and save their ICE ""toy"" for weekends and track days.

What they don't seem to realize is that will help usher in an era where their ICE ""toys"" will be almost useless if even enthusiasts are driving EVs 80+% of the time. If the vast majority of vehicles on the road are EV the fueling infrastructure will get downsized big time. Any brand new fun, weekend ""toy"" performance car in that scenario that's affordable will be an EV, too.

That's the model right now for affordable performance cars: often the same platform as some cheap commuter but with upgrades. A P3D is a SR with a bigger battery, extra motor, performance rear motor, suspension, brake and tire upgrades... It's cheap because most of the car comes from the same production line as several million other plain Jane grocery getters. In that world if you want a performance ICE you'll probably need at least $0.5M dollars to get a completely custom-built machine."
"Welp, you are right about the 1996 iteration of the minivan.  I hadn't even looked at the dates in the article and assumed it was the introduction of the minivan, but that was 1983/84 timeframe.  That is the giant leap that I am lionizing, so I'll happily back off my stance since the '96 Caravan was just the best version of the minivan and not the moment the class was propelled forward.

I still don't think the minivan is somehow dried up and dying... Yes, SUVs are more popular now, but for all the reasons Tesla is taking off, SUVs will recede and I think suburban families will find themselves back in Minivans.  That prediction is no more or less valid than all the Futurology surrounding EVs.  The fact is, we don't know what will happen in the future, so basing a historical award on what we think is going to happen seem foolish.

Regardless, this has been fun.  Here's hoping that Tesla does usher in a new era for the automotive industry.  I just have this nagging feeling that change is hard and it will be decades and decades before we see anywhere near the kind of EV saturation everyone keeps expecting to happen immediately."
The older versions are pretty shit. But the latest version is pretty good.
I kept a nice film camera for years after I switched to digital. In 2015 it was too difficult and expensive to find film and processing services so I gave up. I see this as comparable.
Compared to 2013 tesla though...
"Good comparison, too! For a long time it was true that digital just couldn't compete with 35mm for image quality. People in 2019 sticking to their guns that ICEs will always be better than EVs because heavy batteries/range loss in winter/fill up my tank in minutes are as short-sighted as someone in 1995 saying digital will never be better than film."

"Aarrgghh! Spiders in my bloody mirrors! And huntsmen in my air vents! I’m so sick of cleaning them out, only to have another one take their place a few months later. Maybe it’s the dead insects over the front that it loves, no? I once parked up against a small bush after a long drive in the country. By next morning the ants had cleaned all the dead insects from the entire front of my car! I was genuinely shocked. But I’ve never had a snake in my car. I guess as an Australian, I’m a bit of a failure."

Asking the real questions here
"This is how perceptions change: there was a time when US made cars aced the NHTSA tests, the French aced the European tests and the Germans (the ones that sold both in Europe and the US) did so-so in both testing standards. Now we have a US car that aces literally every test you can find. And we think that’s normal and the standard..."
"If they retested vehicles and didn't allow companies to reuse their ratings would be where you see the difference.

Take for example the 79 series landcruiser single cab. At one point it got a 3 star rating for safety, however when mining companies demanded a 5 start rating vehicle Toyota installed extra airbags, VSC and ABS to bring it up to a 5 star rating as of 2015 from what I recall. 

These days the 79 series would actually receive a 2-3 star rating now due to the lack of newer safety features like reversing cameras, automatic braking, etc which are all required by ANCAP now. 

However if Toyota released the same model as a 'series 2' update with no safety changes they could still use the 5 star rating from the original tests in 2015.

Like health Stars, The whole system is broken unless you look at each individual report."

Watch the video carefully and you will realize that it is the same as the Euroncap one. They don't do another test.

"Contrary to popular Australian memes your average Aussie lives in a built up area and would rarely see anything more than a few spiders every now and then anyway.

The five stars are misleading but the detailed reports are quite good imo. They should also test crash avoidance systems at higher speeds though and maybe find out at (roughly) what speed the system starts to fail. In comparison to their other test it seems quite a simple one.

"Story time!

I used to have a GT500 Shelby Cobra 09 with 12,000 miles on it. And I had a very interesting experience with a snake finding it’s way under the dash after being found in the engine bay. Had a friend drive it up and down the road for a while hoping the snake would crawl out and if never did. Later after watching the car for hours it finally crawled out and my mum killed it. Idk about new cars but older ones snakes tend to figure out how to get in. Maybe not into the cabin but definitely in the car."
"Yep, pretty much completely harmless to people, but they have one of the highest kill counts, because they get in peoples sun visors. Then when it gets opened, the spider drop in the drivers lap, who panics, and crashes the car."

My point is less about US cars vs the rest. My point is about the fact that cars used to ace one kind of test and were average in the others. Even the Model S - while being awesome in the US test - was not perfect in the European test. The Model 3 is awesome in any test they throw at it. That’s simply amazing!
"I still think they should have separate ratings for passive safety and for active safety—a bit like you have different ratings for water and dust penetration on things like smartphones. 

That way, we don’t have the situation where\* the Ford Mustang and the Kia Stinger (200S and 330S variants) are both 3 stars despite the Mustang having absolutely dire passive safety, but making it up in the active safety features, whereas the Stinger has phenomenal passive safety\*\*, but had basically no active safety which knocked it rating down.

\* For clarity, they’re both tested in 2017

\*\* As demonstrated by the other variants from that cycle which have a 5 star rating due to their active safety."
"Never mind badgers. Moose is the real danger. I haven’t checked the stats lately, but a decade ago it used to be around 400 collisions a year with moose in Norway. Then there’s reindeer, deer and all the other smaller animals. I suspect badgers are quite far down on the list as I’ve never hear of or met anyone who has hit a badger (and talked about it)."

Agreed. I really hope they go through with the suggestions of scraping the luxury tax or providing some discount on electric vehicles.
They’re on-par with a C-Class or 3-Series which is exactly what was intended. The Performance model is way cheaper than anything remotely comparable.

This really has to go with any big animal hitting your car tbh. Don’t know anyone personally who has died from hitting a deer but a friend of mine had a friend that died when a deer went through the windshield. They were driving a small car so it just went right over the hood and straight into the vehicle.

"Yes?  

They test them at some speeds but they sort of just pass at some point. I’d love to see a chart that shows the max speed at which a car would still avoid a crash. Like a tipping point. It would be interesting to see if the Tesla would be at 100 km/h and other cars at 80 km/h or something."
I don't think they will. The coalition government will try and save ICE vehicles as much as they can

Everything OK bud?
"If you can aim for the ass you can probably avoid it too (it’s still easily a good 200kg though). Most of the time they just come running out of nowhere (or a thick forest) like a freight train. Too bad their poor instincts tell to hide and then cross the open space as quickly as possible. In Sweden and Finland they trim away a lot more vegetation next to the larger roads (higher speed limits == more trim). In Norway we prefer to let the moose have the element of surprise. 

But good to know that I should also try to avoid hitting badgers. However, if I ever saw one I’d probably be too busy being all exited about seeing my first badger ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"

"This line at the end confuses me some

> There’s a portion of the car buying public that will never consider  Tesla due to a myriad of reasons, and that’s exactly the demographic  where the e-tron could dominate. 

Who exactly is the customer that they're talking about?  Who would consider the e-tron, yet totally dismiss a Tesla? I know there are certainly people that have zero interest in an electric vehicle, even if it would be a good choice for them, but I'm having a hard time defining the customer base they're describing."
They should park these etrons next to their dieselgate cars and convince them to give up the polluting cars.
"If Audi were, like, *actually participating* in the Supercharger network -- contributing to its expansion, making vehicles that could charge from it -- then I'd say it would be quite acceptable to have some demos hanging out at SCs.  They would be welcome siblings!

But yeah, as it is, this is stupid, and quite sad.  Obviously the marketing team is under orders to avoid targeting ICEs, as that's still the core business for the company."
"What feedback are they expecting with their test drives for Tesla owners?

-Car has less range
-No infrastructure to support low range
-Car is slower
-Car not as elegant
-Not as much seating as Tesla SUV

The only thing Audi can beat Tesla at is probably in price. And the type of car buyer that owns a Tesla isn't looking for a cheap car. And neither are Audi owners. They're literally wasting their marketing dollars in the worst possible way."
"That's really bad.  Talk about being shady as hell.  Even if I had an ICE and was looking to switch to an EV, that would be a hard no to Audi for pulling that kind of stunt."
"Digging out the content from February....

"Former Tesla employee here, now the e-tron Ambassador for one of the largest markets in the US. It absolutely pains me to see this. Sometimes Audi totally misses the mark with PR, but I'm hoping to develop enough influence so that these kind of blunders don't occur again in the future. They certainly won't under my jurisdiction.

The e-tron SUV is a terrific vehicle overall, but this just isn't the right approach for marketing."
"Y'all.

Keep in mind that just because a couple Audi employees who were driving the cars blocked a few superchargers doesn't  mean that there was some policy handed down from Audi HQ to do so.

People make dumb mistakes. Some of them work at Audi.

It doesn't necessarily mean this was like *corporate strategy* or whatever."
"One Audi was parked and blocked a SC. One. That hardly translates to a strategy.

Not saying what they do is right, but this title and article rely heavily on clickbait and sensation."
[deleted]
Étron indeed.
"The e tron looks nice. Quiet cabin, I guess, and decent looks. Way better than those BMW I cars. It has CarPlay, which is nice. 

I would definitely get a model y or model x before I’d get an etron, but I’d take one for a test drive first just to check it out. The thought of walking into a regular car dealer makes me sick, though - I hate their slimy sales pitch. It’s nice to see a decent option hitting the market, though. It would be nice if they acknowledged that if Tesla didn’t exist these cars wouldn’t exist either."
"Here’s how a imagine a conversation would go:

“so, how many charging stations do you have worldwide?”

“None”

“Oh, so you guys have a longer range, right?” 

“Umm.. well”"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckzbnpW_Kus

They didn't block anyone.

In the video you can see that there are unoccupied spots. 

Audi employees are present and show the car. It's not like they just left the car there.

The sign behind them is german and it says that the parking spot is for *all* EVs. There is no such thing as Tesla-exclusive parking spots, only EV exclusive. 

Whoever runs that Mc Donald's opted to put some Superchargers next to EV parking spots. And they also very much gave permission to Audi park there.


If anything, this whole outcry shows that *any* charger should be accessible to all EVs. You wouldn't want brand exclusive gas stations either."
"Lmao, this will work great

""Oh hey, I see you're here charging your car, how would you like to downgrade to a car with less features and a lower radius, all while not having access to the very supercharging network you're using! Whaddya say?!""

Think I'll pass, dick. Just move please lol"
The place to convert tesla owners is BEFORE the purchase. Not blocking their access to charging after the fact...
"Talk about swing. They found one audi blocking one stall at one location and the entire article is based around that.

Incredibly biased. 

I'd still never buy an e-tron but that's besides the point."
"Several Tesla owners in Germany (including myself) have been told lies about Tesla’s performance in order to sell the E Tron.
Specifically “a Tesla can only reach 250km/h once, and then never again, the battery management prohibits it as it would damage the battery irreparably.”
This must have been some advice in their sales handbook, if prospective buyers inquire about the low (for the German mindset) top speed of 200 km/h, as this “fact” was repeatedly presented in different Audi Showrooms by different sales people."
I'd be very interested to see their pitch to Tesla owners that probably did a ton of research into their EV options already and are now annoyed that the charger is being blocked. Talk about starting from a 6 foot hole...
Baller move for a car that only gets 200 miles from 94KWh
"I'd simply asked them to plug it into the Supercharger. When they say that they can't, I would reply with ""well, that's too bad"" as I plug in my Tesla."
"Luckily Tesla’s have the range to just go to another charger. If Audi actually had their own network of chargers, and Tesla blocked them, they would be screwed since there’s no way they have the range to get to another one."
No better way to attract new customers than to annoy the shit out of them
"I'd like to point out that they will sell exactly 0 (zero) E-trons in french-speaking territories, because the word ""étron"" means ""piece of shit"" in french. Gotta be the most insane marketing localization mistake I've seen in my life."
"The article has a point, but the hysteria about blocking superchargers when clearly there are numerous open spots and nobody is prevented from charging is just silly."
"This is an article on a tesla biased newspaper on a tesla subreddit. Not saying it isn't true or anything but Im just sceptical of just how much of this is true, if true at all, and if it is true, Audi are being shady."
"I have to wonder what their goal is.  Yes, there are fast(+150kw) public chargers in europe so people can buy an e-tron and actually charge it.  But no one is buying a car that is twice as expensive with less range and slower charging.  E-tron goes 150kw, model 3s can hit 195kw on public chargers that go that high in addition to superchargers as they are upgraded.

Offering test drives to existing tesla owners would be the biggest mistake because they are going to point out the deficiencies and talk about it.  Plus what person who just bought a tesla is going to sell it for an e-tron?  Who exactly are they trying to market to?"
"Dear Audi, please go block a gas pump."
"Let me get this straight, they are parking an Audi with less range than any Tesla in front of a supercharger network, which Audi doesn’t have, in order to get Tesla owners to switch?? What? This just shows how shit the Audi is."
"Unless there plan is to convert people who like sticking it to Tesla, I don't see this working out how they intended... though we are sharing it on the Tesla subreddit and now checking if that side mirror-less car ever worked out."
This site is gives me aids.
Some may call this a German occupation...
EV with a grille is a big LOL from me 😂
"Theres plenty of eyebrow raising issues here, but what I find most interesting is that with the Audi, you can't receive and future updates that relate to the drivetrain or how power is managed. I found that to be one of the biggest issues, let alone range issues etc."
Supercharger should be able to fire electrons to any non-Tesla on it's turf!
Still don’t want one.
"Come buy our poorly engineered electric cars.
As quality as our A4."
"This is the Tesla killer we were all warned about. They have no chance of succeeding on their own merits, so they are pulling these stunts in a half-baked last-ditch attempt.

Game over"
Audi hubris at its finest.
Sold my Audi and bought a Tesla. Sorry Audi

"At a quick glance, this seems like a good strategy - go after your competition head on. But as you consider it more closely, it is deeply flawed. 

First, as many have pointed out, taking on Tesla at a Supercharger is ceding Home Field Advantage. 

Second, Tesla is the leader in the EV market but has only a small fraction of the overall car market. Even stealing 100% of their share of the EV market is not a success, long term.

Third, Tesla owners already bought an EV. They would be better off courting BMW owners. 

This is clearly a case of them not knowing their market or competition. Their main competition are ICE cars.  The fact that they don’t realize this is disturbing. 

I think those of you that are long on TSLA might do well to short GM, Ford, VW, etc. One or two of them may see the light before it’s too late, but there will be several that go by the wayside in the next 5-10 years."
Are they seriously thinking they can lure Tesla owners to switch to Audi??  The only way this Audi electric car sells is if the customer never drove a Tesla before....
Slash their tires. Most marketing type are wimps.
Do all the e-tron frunk always fill with charging cables?
"If that was the last charging station and I see them parking there, I’m booting his ass out!"
In what world would not having access to a massive network of high speed chargers be any kind of reason for someone to purchase let alone convert someone to buying their vehicles.

"This is a terrible marketing idea.  They want to make one of those 'listen to these Tesla owners who switched why Audi is better ' commercials, in doing so implicitly defining Tesla as the market leader, and  giving exposure to Tesla."
Guess they got to park these unsold vehicles somewhere
Why the fuck would anybody who already owns a tesla downgrade to an etron?
So you could go out and buy a 2012 ModelS that has more range for only a bit more than %50 the cost of an etron... With a better safety rating...
More proof that all the asshole BMW drivers are now Audi drivers.
So happy i sold me s4 for a model 3 long range
Wrong target. You 're not going to convince a tesla owner to switch to the etron. Would have better luck at a gas station
Why are they going after people who already bought an expensive car instead of people in the market? Do they think Tesla owners will sell their vehicles at a loss to buy their car? Makes no financial sense whatsoever. The people least likely to buy a car are the ones who just bought one.
This post makes me want to learn more about the etron.  Hopefully it gets upvoted to the front.  Any publicity is good publicity.
"Vag are unethical, my vw had a known fault where the insides of the egr disintegrate causing bore wear and high oil consumption.

They refused exchange the egr with a new design which has a special coating just outside warranty. I decided the best option for me was egr and dpf delete paid out of my pocket, not happy about driving around with increased emissions."

"So if anyone is pulling up to a Tesla Supercharging station, then they have already invested in a Tesla.  They very likely aren't looking to buy a new car.  Honestly, what are they thinking?

""Hey, you there charging up your Tesla 3 Performance, wanna buy an e-Tron?  It costs over twice a much and has a much lower range, doesn't work with the supercharger network, it doesn't have AutoPilot, and the 0-100km/h is twice that of your car, but it's an Audi!  Oooooooooo!""

"When they first did this was ages ago. Dunno about a year or so.

A time, when the car was about as expensive as Model X but half the range and no quick chargers. I guess most Tesla owners, if not all, had nothing more than a smug smile (unless they blocked the last charging spot)...

I don't think much changed since then, except the Model X has even more range :D"
I would have laughed in their faces.
"I can't see any interaction going in a direction that isn't ""please don't bother me with your offerings of a car that is inferior in every conceivable metric."" I'd be uncomfortable charging there because I wouldn't want them bothering me honestly."
"Ok so now I think Audi are desperate assholes. Great marketing job, geniuses."

"Their strategy is so short sighted. By all means, the Etron is not a bad car. It's not as good as a Tesla, but it's not bad. It is exactly the type of car a Elon/Tesla-hater would love to try. Apparently they are offering test drives to Tesla/former Audi owners. You aren't convincing a Tesla owner to get a Etron with those stats, but a BMW, Mercedes, or Lexus owners may think about switching to EV with a established company like Audi.

It's like they are trying to fail and then say that the public doesn't want EV and its just a fad."
“Tired of paying for Premium unleaded for the Audi you bought last year? Well we have ANOTHER car for you to buy”
"their downfall will be assuming the competition of EVs is EVs, not all cars.."
that is very true! Set up a display in the parking lot and offer a free 20 oz  drink coupon that they can use inside if you walk over. Would cost few quarters per coupon
"The other manufacturers are afraid of Tesla.


Tesla has like what, maybe 1% market penetration? And that's who Audi decides to go after? Fucking idiots. Should've just gone to a gas station and saved the bad publicity."
I doubt it. The vast majority of people can't even afford the car. And of those left not everyone will be interested in an EV.
Yea because... every Tesla driver simply missed out in the chance to learn about etron..
They're bringing freeze-dried Taster's Choice to a Starbucks convention. [NSFW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1-1dUbBjgE)
"With a 95 kWh battery, nonetheless. *chuckles*"
"If its rated for 200, it will get less than that. Good luck selling anyone on it. If you cant refill easily and the range is so limited, then it would be good for city driving.. oh yeah, it's an SUV. So strike that."
But at least Audi has a supercharging netwo... oh
"but they got nice gap panels, lot of buttons inside? /s"
"It's not so bad, comparing it to a Model 3 is not really fair to either vehicle.  Compared to a Model X is a little more fair (similar class vehicle).  Model X still comes out on top, but not as handily as the hyper-efficient sedan:

[Model X SR Houston to Big Bend: 12:37 w/ 2:50 charging](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/?plan_uuid=b1a97d05-6518-438e-b64c-2103306c97e9)

[Audi E-Tron Houston to Big Bend: 11:49 w/ 2:23 charging](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/?plan_uuid=1a04d05a-d294-4261-a5ad-b986daaa5f26)

[Model X LR Houston to Big Bend: 10:57 w/ 1:49 charging](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/?plan_uuid=b1a97d05-6518-438e-b64c-2103306c97e9)

Given a choice between the two, I'd pick the Model X, Autopilot is way better, interior is great, and tons of space.  But I don't think the difference on a road trip is as massive as some seem to think."
"There is one I see on my commute home sometimes, I just have to shake my head."
At least it comes with an interior.
"Is your sr+ a model 3? I get confused with the model #s. 

The etron is a car for someone who would be considering a model x. The price is a little bit cheaper than a model x. The range, acceleration, autopilot, and charging network are all worse, of course."
"My main roadblock to electric isn't ""range anxiety"". It's ""How quickly can I replenish back to max range?"".

My car (ICE) has a range of just over 300 miles before needing a refill of 11 gallons. So I can go from having <50 miles of range left to over 300 in under 2 minutes.

Even the fastest superchargers can't accomplish that, as of yet.

So long distance road tripping isn't feasible. Even 15 minute supercharges just don't compare to the speed of gasoline refills."
"Another commenter to you said this was a ""minor"" point.  No.  Absolutely not.  This is a major major point, and ultimately this will lead some of the major legacy automakers to the grave.  EVs aren't reaaaaaly in competition with each other so much as they are in competition with ICE vehicles.  Once someone decides they want an EV... that customer is almost guaranteed lost to your ICE business FOREVER.  If you aren't willing to commit to the death of your own ICE business, then you are committed to your own death."
VAG gives me AIDS
"This is a minor but very important point. 

Volkswagen primarily wants to kill Tesla so they can recover the status quo and go back to making lackluster (compared to now) cars while still charging premium prices"
"Even if that demographic exists at any reasonable numbers, why would they be at a *Tesla* supercharger? None of this makes any sense."
"Audi diehards, Elon haters, Silicon Valley/Tech Haters, People who want their buttons, etc etc"
"There probably are certain people, but I'm sure those people don't go to a supercharger."
"Perhaps those that go to dealerships for vehicles. There are actually a lot of people that still don't know what a Tesla is, and some people really enjoy haggling at a traditional dealership. Not to mention brand loyalty. If Honda had an attractive EV in North America (in terms of drivability, range, support, etc.) for example, I may have gotten that over a Tesla."
[deleted]
"And who would consider an E-Tron, totally dismiss a Tesla, and be found at a supercharger lmao"
People who bought $TSLA at $384
"I’m just a car guy hopping through the front page, and not expecting to get much love for this, but Tesla has some issues. Would they stop me from buying one? Probably not. I really like them and I think what they’re doing is really cool, but the fit and finish is just not where it should be. The model 3 is more in line, but the S has problems for the price. I should not be able to spot the orange peel and other paint defects in your approximately 100k car with a cursory glance as we’re both driving down the road. Same can be said of the body panel figment, the way the doors are aligned (or more to the point, not aligned), lots of little details like that. I absolutely think they can get it right, but VAG, Mercedes, BMW, all have about a 100 year head start on Tesla building cars. They get all of that stuff right already, and I think it’s going to take them a lot less time to catch up on the batteries and electric drivetrain than you would think. 

I may also be talking out of my ass, but isn’t Tesla still having issues delivering a lot of replacement parts? I remember reading about a year or so ago that if your Tesla was rear ended, there was about a 3 month wait time to get replacement body panels. Again, I may be wrong, but if I want new parts for a mainline auto manufacturer, I can get them in a timeline on the order of days, not hours. 

Again, I just want to qualify and say that Tesla’s are really friggin cool, but there are still issues you won’t see when the big German and Japanese manufacturers roll out their EV lines."
"Being from Germany I can assure you there are lots. Mostly for reasons like Tesla being new, having wrong informations about Tesla‘s superiority, only seeing bad news about Tesla online, etc etc.   
But trust me, the biggest reason is probably that everyone knows how good and reliable an Audi is and so why would I go to a more expensive and (considering ICE driven news) less reliable Tesla..."
"Until today, I had never heard of an e tron.  And thanks to their superb marketing techniques I hope to never hear about it again."
What reasons are they?  Reasons!
TSLA shorters for instance. Want an EV but also want to see Tesla shares stumbld. So yeah  they would sing praises to high hell and be willing to get in second best EVs
My dad who got a model 3 after I convinced him originally said that he was worried that the company would fail and therefore the Tesla car won't be supported anymore as there wouldn't be any new parts being made and making repairs quite expensive. But after he got the model 3 his regrets and fears went away.
People with enough money who still see Audi as a status symbol. The same people who didn’t  compare performance or don’t care about it.
"Many Germans, for example, would not discussed a Tesla because it is an American company. Others have a poor image of Elon Musk.
Some might not like the styling of the minimalistic interior, some might want thicker, softer seats, and there are plenty that live the feeling of physical buttons and don't want touch screens.
Seriously, there IS a market there for a non-Tesla EV that doesn't suck, they just don't seem to want to address it, just too much work."
"I wouldn't buy a Tesla for there piss poor service. I tried really hard to buy the car. But they weren't able to give me one. And the issues that my neighbors have are something that I don't want to deal with.

A dealership adds value. Yes they can be unethical. But they car about selling a car because they need to move them off the lot. 

I know I am going to get hate. I do support there effort! I just would not by a product from them."
Yeah even the world's biggest tslaq short sellers drive teslas
"My neighbour is one, he bought an I-Pace. 

I think Tesla is too radical from what he is used to and likes and I can understand that."
"What marketing genius came up with that name? Can you see all these guys sitting in a conference room, and one says ""How 'bout Voltron?"" ""nah, it's been done. It's got to do with electricity, you know like 'email'. E... e... ewheel? ego? eride?

And then Chet stands up, slaps his palm on the genuine imitation burled cherrywood table and exclaims, ""I've got it! e...TRON!""

And the suits were pleased and the shareholders appeased."
"> If Audi were, like, actually participating in the Supercharger network

I know they have no interest, but could they technically participate if they wanted to?  AFAIK SCs are proprietary, and a competitive advantage for Tesla.  I see Elon eventually opening it up in the future."
"Meh, as long as they don't block the stalls as could be seen in some pics it's fine.

People charge their cars and sometimes have little to do. Looking at another product in the mean time doesn't do any harm."
Lying about diesel emissions? Audi is no brother of mine!
"You could say the same about Tesla.

Tesla is the one who didn't go with the industry standard CCS or CHAdeMO and went for their proprietary solution.

Audi also *is* contributing to fast charger networks (Ionity, Electrify America).


The thing is....Tesla cars can use Ionity, Electrify America, etc without Tesla Inc paying the owners of those networks a dime.

At the same time, Tesla Inc wants money from other manufacturers if they want their brand to use the SuperChargers."
"Etron starts at 75k while model X starts at 90k (US) minus all the incentives. 

Etron has 200 miles range (usable range is probably less). Model x has 290 miles range. I'd say 15k for almost 50% more range is well worth it. That 15k probably ends up being less once you get tax credits. Oh and then there's the fact that you'll undoubtedly spend more on fuel (electricity) with the etron due to its garbage efficiency. 


I love it, 'compeitiors' are finally coming to market and they're realizing that they cant compete so they try to sabotage the market leader. I will NEVER buy any vehicle produced by Volkswagen or any of their subsidiaries."
"Having not sat in an E-Tron, my suspicion is that it also kills Tesla on interior refinement."
"HUD, Matrix LED headlights, 360°camera..."
"Car buyers are not rational.  They are emotional.  People buy based on hype and brand loyalty and marketing and image projection and also, product features."
Apparently Teslarati didn't pick it up earlier and I haven't seen it here before. Thought the community would like to see this 'interesting' marketing strategy.
"So they didn't really block anyone. Audi employees are right there to present it to people. There are empty spots.


The sign behind them is german. It says EV parking only, not Tesla exclusive.

The chargers can only be used by Tesla cars.

Whoever runs that Mc Donald's opted to put some Superchargers next to EV parking spots. And they also very much gave permission to Audi park there."

What about it is terrific considering Tesla's offerings? I'm genuinely curious if there's an answer that doesn't involve sacrificing navigate on autopilot for slightly better headlights.
"If this was just an isolated incident, sure. To me it's starting to look more like some kind of pattern at Audi. They already claimed that the E-tron charges faster than the Model 3, which was easily debunked. We've got Audi dealers reputedly fibbing about Tesla's performance to potential customers, as if somebody's been feeding them talking points. It doesn't look good. It doesn't look honest, even."

It's not even blocking. The parking spaces are free for every EV. Just the superchargers behind them can't be used by every EV.
Amen.
Amen to that!!
Yes. I have a model 3 and a Q5 and i'm considering getting a Y in a few years but I'll totally try out what audi and everyone has to offer before buying a Y.
"No, this is what they would say, from Audi’s e-tron page

>	A nationwide network of 16,000+ charging stations will support nearly any itinerary. And Electrify America plans to add to the network with over 480 stations with 2000+ dispensers (with charging speeds from 50kW to 350kW) by the end of 2019."
"How many gas stations does any car manufacturer have worldwide?


Audi is part of Ionity/Electrify America. They also use industry standard CCS. So they can use *all* charger networks."
https://ionity.evapi.de/#/
well what would you expect from a site with tesla in the name.. either way this makes audi look like shit for promoting a mechanically inferior car while blocking a super charger
Pretty much what I'd expect from VW. Cant build a superior product so they just deceive consumers. I'm soooooo surprised after the whole dieselgate debacle. This company is trash

Agreed.

There is a big difference between being able to hit a certain speed an sustain it. And you could argue the same way about nobody buying a Model S or X then. Especially since the 3 isn't a hatch it's a non-starter for many Europeans anyway.
Insane or insanely rich people is my best guess

"Yes, we can"
It's probably far more effective than a TV commercial.

"The e-tron scores fairly substantially better than the 2014 Model S on the EuroNCAP tests, at least by direct comparison. The Model S got a 82% on adult occupant and 77% on child occupant, but the e-Tron got 91% and 85% respectively. (For reference, the 3 got 96% and 86%.) The EuroNCAP rating system changed between those two years so the numbers are *not* directly comparable -- but one would think that they would generally become *more* stringent, not less, which would increase the e-tron's advantage.

(The e-tron does not appear to have been tested yet by the NHTSA or IIHS, so EuroNCAP is the only comparison point I know of. Also remember that earlier Model Ss at least do relatively meh on the IIHS's small frontal offset test, so a comparison going in the e-tron's favor is 100% believable.)"
"Who says Tesla owners just bought them? If anything, the e-Tron is probably aimed at the S/X market more than the 3 market, and those cars have been on the market for several years. Plenty of those owners would cycle to something else if they liked it. Even the first 3s are now two years old, so if someone is used to cycling every three years it won't be too long before they're on the market.

And don't forget, Audi doesn't ""need"" you to buy the e-Tron *now*, just... some time. If you get yourself a new car every three years and your 3 is a year old and in two years you think back ""hey, I saw the e-Tron a bit ago and liked it, let me check it out"" -- Audi did its job today."
Why does any car manufacturer advertise their cars ever?
"If one thing would guarantee I’d never buy their fucking car, it’s some douchebag preventing me from going about it my business."

Tasty bits:

>his time two years ago, the European Commission leveled a record-breaking **$3.4 billion fine** at Volvo/Renault, Daimler, Iveco and DAF for **colluding “on the pricing** and on passing on the costs for meeting environmental standards to customers” for their diesel trucks. **Volkswagen’s MAN was also a colluding party, but they were exempted from the fine for exposing the other manufacturers.**

and

>In **April this year**, though, Volkswagen and Daimler were caught again, and this time with BMW.

>The three automobile manufacturers were accused of **colluding to limit, delay and avoid the adoption of selective catalytic reduction systems and Otto particle filters**, both technologies designed to reduce toxic emissions from diesel engines found in ordinary cars. The toxic emissions are a large contributor to the pollution associated with tens of thousands of deaths each year, and the only benefit to the manufacturers was profit. The **EU is still investigating.**"
That's exactly what the people who say is going to backfire are missing. They are not the ones being targeted with this marketing.
"y'know, the rest of the world.

FTFY"
Nobody feels convinced buying their cars like this. This kind of advertisement is disgusting!
Well...Buzzfeed
To me it’s a similar concept as getting an account number from a company and they refuse/give you a hard time in giving it out. Does that experience of hassle make you want to stay with the company?
Yet another dumb move by the audi marketing team.  Etron indeed
That's just a sign that the Volkswagen/Audi company knows that Tesla is their (long term) biggest competitor. The ICE companies are already doomed so they're not as important to focus competing with.
You mean rich people?
"Judging by the increasing number of teslas I see daily the fad is over.

Why not? I klow a tesla owner that sold the tesla to buy the etron. That they have arround 6 months behind delivery and it was filled with errors and software bugs so it has been sent back apperently dosent matter for this guy.
"I don’t understand why anyone in their right mind would buy a car that takes premium but also isn’t a sports car, that’s nonsense to me."
I think the difference is they don’t give a shit about selling electric cars. They just want to sell cars. In fact I bet if they could they wouldn’t sell EV’s due to the short term margins

"You know, lots of people on this sub rip on the e-Tron for it's poor efficiency, and to an extent it absolutely deserves it. But on the other hand, if I had an hour commute each day, or spent the day driving around because I were a real estate agent, something like that -- day-to-day comfort would matter much more to me than the e-Tron's poor efficiency and rage. And I say this as someone who actually takes long road trips pretty reliably. In that scenario, if I were in the market for a car in the upper tens-of-thousands, the e-Tron, i-Pace, and Model S would *all* be on my radar. (The 3 would not be. The Y would be if it was available or I didn't mind waiting.) I honestly don't know which of these would be most likely though; it might be a toss-up between all three."

Now, both are great cars (...if Tesla didn't exist).

>I-pace has this stupid lag/delay throughout the car; when pressing the acc. pedal, it take a little moment before actually accelerating. Also the HVAC button/wheels has a similar delay/lag.
Infotainment is beyond useless. Install a Windows Vista on a Nokia, and that is how it feels like.
Autopilot/autosteer here is useless.

>E-tron has terrible acceleration (not lag), super slow for an EV.
Regen is weak (even on dynamic mode), one has to press the brake for the regen to hit harder. AKA one pedal driving is not functional.
Infotainment is much better than I-pace, but nowhere near one big screen . Same reason you don't want two separate screen on your laptop.

There are people who really wanted and EV and got a Tesla because it was the only viable option. Those might be open to switch back to the traditional manufacturers once they launch EVs.
"Hyundai is making that 160mi range EV that will supposedly be $30k and be out by the end of the year, but they know it will only sell in europe because the US has no chargers.  Europeans also drive less in distance.

I would also bet they raise the price in the US to milk that tax credit, no way do they let people buy them for $23k after the tax credit is applied.

As it stands, nothing works in the US unless you treat it as a short range EV just for a daily commute.  The people who can do that are married people where the spouse has an ICE for long range travel.  Hawaii, alaska, and puerto rico will be the places in the US where EVs with short range can thrive.  Alaska may work only because people already plug block heaters in, so they can plug their EVs in just the same on the 120v to keep the battery warm.

None of the existing car companies has any interest in making chargers because if they built chargers, EVs would then sell."
People (like me) that moved to a city 3.5 hours from the closest Tesla service center but the city has an Audi dealership.
"\>  No one, but that's not what they said. You just quoted their statement so I'm not sure where you got that idea. 

If someone ""will never consider a Tesla"", doesn't that mean they are totally dismissing a Tesla? Pretty much means the same thing, no?

And most of the things on your list are concerns that many people would have, I doubt most of them would keep most people from even *considering* a Tesla. Lots of people with many of those concerns buy Teslas anyway, because the positives outweigh the concerns. I had several of the concerns on your list myself. Still bought one, no regrets."

"But german cars are not reliable ... I only drove german since 2009 and I can tell you reliability is the last thing people think when they say ""german car"".  You should try drive one past 150k km. I don't have the courage."
"An Audi is reliable ?!??

LOL"
I bet this post didn't change your opinion on buying an Audi.
YEAH!! REASONS!!! WHAT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND GOD DAMN
Interesting!  I think that's the first one I've read that really made sense to me.
"Or maybe a French speaking employee in the marketing team who hated them for dieselgate, pulled a fast one on them."
"Tesla has opened the network to anyone willing to help with the cost of the network. No one has taken them up on it.

The Tesla connector is by far and away the most elegant of all connectors. I wish it could become the standard."
"I don't see it being opened up unless you buy your battery pack and charging circuits from tesla.  Something they aren't even going to entertain while they are production limited for their own products.

It makes no sense to let anyone on the network unless they can match the max charge speed and charge curve of tesla.  Only tesla batteries can do that right now.

Letting slower cars onto the network just causes problems for their own customers.

Rivian is the only company using cylindrical cells that might be capable enough to work.  The rest are all using cheaper slow charging pouch/prismatic cells."
"I thought Tesla opened their patents up on their charging standards, but no one has taken them up on the offer despite it?"
"Fully participating in the SC network would be pretty redemptive though, in my book.

Of course I *am* talking about an alternate universe here..."
"> That 15k probably ends up being less once you get tax credits. 

In the US, it winds up being more because Audi still receives the full federal credit; now, more than $5K more."
"Base X is 325 mile range starting at $84,990 before incentives."
And that is the most important thing on an EV!! \s
"True that!! My biggest gripe with Tesla's is they just don't feel as premium as they cost. Hopefully that changes. 

The build quality of their premium German cars and even Volvo's is great."
"I've been in equivalently priced sedans and SUVs and I most certainly do not feel the same way. Only thing is that really sporty cars obviously beat the 3 and S in how sporty they feel with seating just because the 3 and S are fucking sedans. Similarly priced Audis, Mercedes, and BMWs are overpriced brand names in a lot of ways; they're nice, but they're not anything special."
"HUD may be nice, never had one, but also have never felt like I was missing out. I imagine that's something you'd have to experience to find out what it's worth. 

Fairly certain my Model 3 has LED headlights, but if it doesn't I have no complaints. The light and coverage from these headlights is light-years better than any other vehicle I've ever been in.

Only concern with Tesla is that the rear cam doesn't record for dashcam footage - something that could probably be enabled via software and would effectively provide constant dashcam footage in a 360 degree field."
"Yeah, that was mostly aimed at the article not you."
"Not sure about blocking the port, but the fact that Audi is actively marketing to Tesla drivers instead of ICE drivers seems kind of desperate."
"There are several things.

1) It's designed like a regular SUV. It has the utility to handle roof racks and the interior cabin space to comfortably accommodate 5 people. No obtrusive doors. I've spent a lot of time with the Model X, and the doors work better than most people give it credit for, but the 10% of the time it has issues, it can be pretty annoying.

2) On the topic of comfort, all luxury-end Audi seats are made with premium hand-picked leather. I've never felt so comfortable in a car seat.

3) Advanced luxury features are more easily obtainable. Ventilated seats are available on the standard trim, and massaging seats are available with the higher trim. The AC system is easy to use and works extremely fast. You can even have it send pleasant scents in the cabin.

4) Audi build quality is legendary, and the e-tron is no exception. It is assembled like a vehicle made from a 100 year old manufacturer. Expect premium materials all throughout, and zero panel gaps or paint issues. Audi doesn't do plastic. Model 3s are absolutely loaded with plastic. S and X also have a notable amount of plastic.

5) The nav system is intelligent, and allows you to view your potential travel radius on the map. The map zooms out to let you see the whole planet.

6) You have actual blind spot monitors in your mirrors and a few safety features not found in Teslas, such as rear cross-traffic alert/braking.

7) You have 3D camera systems, allowing bird's eye view parking assistant and the ability to view all of the on board cameras when parking. There's no excuse for a bad park or any accidental scuff due to limited visibility.

8) The voice command system is already robust with features, but this vehicle is also compatible with Amazon Alexa accounts. If you have a smart home, you can control it with voice commands from your e-tron, along with everything Alexa can always do.

9) Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard

10) The $7500 tax credit is still available, since Audi is a new player in the electric space.

I can rattle off a few more, but these are some of the immediate advantages you'll find with this vehicle."
You can compare products. He is saying that the stall blocking is stupid and most likely not HQ.
"Thanks for the additional info, that makes this article even worse."
"Which is true.

Audi cars use the standard CCS. So you can use any charger and don't need car brand exclusive chargers."
The weight of the cable in this case would be the deciding factor in this scenario.  To maintain throughput at speeds desired the average person would have trouble on addition to the unnecessary expense.
"The supercharger stations operate at very high power, so the cords are thick/expensive.  Long cords would be more likely to be left lying on the ground, driven over, etc., and need to be replaced.  There would also be some loss in charging power/speed with longer cords.

This isn't nearly as big of a factor when charging at home since the power used is much smaller."
"The cords are thick/heavy. Probably expensive and every inch adds to the waste heat. 

They just barely reach the one stall they reach."
"Simple, Tesla doesn't want to pay for it. The way they are doing it, they can just rent the space for the actual chargers. If they had to rent the parking space it would be much more expensive."
"If there are other handicap spaces readily available and the owner of the vehicle is there and able to move at a moment's notice, then yes I would."

Are you really comparing charging stations to handicap spots? This fucking cult is a joke.
"Apples and Oranges.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckzbnpW_Kus

They didn't block anyone.

In the video you can see that there are unoccupied spots.

Audi employees are present and show the car. It's not like they just left the car there.

The sign behind them is german and it says that the parking spot is for all EVs. There is no such thing as Tesla-exclusive parking spots, only EV exclusive.

Whoever runs that Mc Donald's opted to put some Superchargers next to EV parking spots. And they also very much gave permission to Audi park there.

If anything, this whole outcry shows that any charger should be accessible to all EVs. You wouldn't want brand exclusive gas stations either."
"I don't get why people want hatches, they are always designed poorly in that they sacrifice back seat space for hatch space, even though a hatch should have less hatch space with he ability to fold seats down when cargo space is needed.

The chevy volt's biggest issue is a backseat only children can use."
"Yeah, they don't get it.  What not just put a fake tailpipe on as well?"

"Seeing as how Audi refused to assist in building out the Supercharger network and is introducing their own competitive charging network....yea they can GTFO.

Bollinger is still waiting for a reply form him...
"The thing is....Tesla cars can use Ionity, Electrify America, etc without Tesla Inc paying the owners of those networks a dime.

At the same time, Tesla Inc wants money from other manufacturers if they want their brand to use the SuperChargers."
Thanks for the education 👍
One marketing team doing this doesn't mean Audi corporate is behind it.  They probably told them to go promote their cars but some wise-ass came up with the idea to block the superchargers.
Around 120 locations in Europe. All of them are faster than superchargers which is why they're used by model 3s.
But some have no balls 😂

"Engines designed in Europe are designed for European fuel which is higher octane and contains less or no ethanol. So European cars sort of take Premium by default.

"Chevy Volt. Takes premium, not a sports car. Worth it"
I'm okay with it on my gen 1 volt... but I buy gas ~3 times a year and premium ages better.
Because used Volts are super cheap and give you 95% of the EV experience.

How are you going to charge the car quickly without reliable supercharging if you're driving around all day? Certainly you wouldnt take a 9 hour lunch break to lv2 recharge the 200 miles on the turd?
"I wouldn't buy one if I had an hour commute each way.  That doesn't leave much room for errands or other power use unless you actually drive the 55 mph EPA rated speed, which is dangerously slow around here."
"Lol. Comfort. What about it? Seats / A/C and autopilot? I have back pains and I'm really picky about ""comfort"" and I made a 4500km euro trip in an Opel Astra 10 years ago. You know what happened? No back pains. Oh, and I even had the A/C on. Can you believe it? You're telling me that I would have the same ""comfort"" in a e-tron, but I just need to pony up just 60k more euros 10 years later? That sounds like a great deal!"
"Yeah, agree that price is bonkers, it's a casualty of their own stupid pricing scheme.  The E-Tron ends up at the bottom of the most expensive charging tier, which is the worst place to be since you're being charged the most per minute for the slowest rates in that tier.  That and they don't meter you down to the lower rate when the taper hits, you get charged for the max power you're pulling from the charger for the whole session, not the live power you're currently drawing.  

I bet public complaints makes them change it in the next few months.  They already had to change it once already.  This is what you get when a bunch of non-EV-drivers design a charging network."

People who switch cars so often are doing more harm than good even if they are electric.
"> no way do they let people buy them for $23k after the tax credit is applied.

What? That makes no sense. The manufacturer doesn't lose any money from the federal tax credit. If anything they'd be extactic to be able to sell their vehicle in the US so that people who can't afford a $30k car will buy it, because they *can* afford a $22500 car."

">Why do Germans think Audis are reliable?

3 reasons:

1.) We drive our cars less. A car with 150.000 miles is seen as pretty ancient.

2.) We care more about our cars and don't neglect the maintanance

3.) We buy the smaller engines, which are usually much more reliable."
There is an Audi dealership on every corner in Germany. If anything breaks you get it fixed really fast. I presume it would be similar in the US with local brands.
"Probably because reliability is defined differently.  
In Germany a car is only reliable if it gets through TÜV (MOT) inspections with little to no costs.  In the US a car is reliable as long as it drives.  

Since there are more things to a car than the drivetrain that can go wrong cars can considered reliable in one market and not in the other.  

Two examples. The PT cruiser is considered a reliable car in the states while being notoriously unreliable in Germany. They always fail inspections because of the suspension or rust.  
Mazdas are considered reliable in the US and yet I know plenty of people who had to scrape them since they rust extremely fast and then fail state inspections."
"I had an Audi 5000 about 30 years ago.

Never.  Again.

I hate to judge a car company by its most famous/egregious product, but that car (while it did have that great German ""feel"" to it) was forever in the shop... and even the Audi mechanics couldn't chase down all of its electrical gremlins."
"I owned an Audi before, it was a very good vehicle.  My sister owns one now.  But I don't plan on owning any other cars except maybe Tesla or older Porsche.  I drive a motorcycle, so until I can't ride I don't have any plans for a car."

"> Tesla has opened the network to anyone willing to help with the cost of the network. No one has taken them up on it.

We don't know what the terms of such an agreement would have been. I think it's a bit disingenuous to pretend that it's a guarantee that Tesla would have been reasonable with their terms.

I liken it a bit to their patent pledge. In theory, they did a really cool thing -- they made what is likely a legally binding promise to (under certain conditions) not sue anyone for patent infringement as long as the company taking them up on their offer made a reciprocal promise. Tesla and Elon presented it as basically a patent analogue to a ""copyleft"" license like the GPL. Except... if you actually read the pledge, it [has so many poison pills in it](http://www.iplawgroup.com/in-the-news/approach-caution-deconstructing-teslas-patent-pledge/) that IMO a company would have to be mildly insane to take them up on it even if they were perfectly willing to enter into an actually well-constructed copyleft patent agreement. It's asymmetrical as hell and is much more restrictive on third parties and permissive on Tesla than a competent copyleft license would have been, to the point I wonder how much it was really made in good faith as opposed to a PR move.

I can 100% see existing companies not taking up Tesla just out of... pride or similar reasons, and there are also likely technical reasons as well. But I *also* have very little confidence that Tesla would have accepted reasonable offers had any been made."
"Have they actually? Elon has made a couple of twitter comments over the years and Tesla has a patent sharing agreement available with terms that no serious automaker would agree to. 

&#x200B;

I haven't seen any actual effort put towards making it a standard. Where are the specs on the connectors and communication protocols? Where are the public terms or even a contact form for licensing their charging connector or interoperate with their network? I don't think Tesla actually wants to do this yet, they're just ""open"" to it as in if Ford or VW came to them with a big pile of money they would be willing to talk."
"It totally should.  The US still has time to adopt the tesla adapter.  The only reason any CCS1 combo chargers even exists is because of VW's settlement to create the small electrify america charging network.  If it wasn't for that legal settlement, no CCS1 combo chargers would be installed anywhere.

The j1772 is way too big for what it does, it has the space for 3 phase, but is only single phase AC or DC.  The added high amperage DC pins on the combo are goofy because in reality two connectors is all you need for DC and single phase AC.

CCS1 Combo is dumb as hell.  We keep the useless j1772 on there for no reason at all.  CCS2 combo is at least justified by europe's use of 3 phase AC.

It should piss everyone off that companies half assing EVs are getting to pick the worst standard for chargers.  But we don't have a government that cares about EVs, so they will never step in forcing the tesla charge tip on everyone.

Other cars won't be able to supercharge, but at least tesla's can then use public chargers without adapters."
"The thing is....Tesla cars can use Ionity, Electrify America, etc without Tesla Inc paying the owners of those networks a dime.

At the same time, Tesla Inc wants money from other manufacturers if they want their brand to use the SuperChargers."
"iirc, they require signing a mutual patent exchange. Being the smaller company they have more to gain from it."
The patent pledge essensially forces the manufacturer to give up all their patents in exchange for any Tesla patent. No manufacturer wants to do that (understandably).
"Totally forgot about that, good call"
So...you're saying the numbers are even more favorable for Tesla? Good
"Obviously not. But it is an area that Tesla is miles behind on, and something Audi can beat Tesla at — which was his original statement."

"> HUD may be nice, never had one, but also have never felt like I was missing out. 

It's one of those things you don't miss until you don't have it anymore.  I had a bmw 540 before my model 3 with navigation in the hud.  I really miss it when driving in an unfamiliar area ... the tablet screen takes my eyes off the road too much.

And I feel like I'm going to miss the heated steering wheel when winter comes around."
"They are at a Mc Donald's parking lot that has *EV* parking lots.

This is *not* a Tesla exclusive parking lot.

They advertise to everyone who drives through or parks at that parking lot."
"You made a few good points that I honestly didn't see coming, thanks for the insight. That being said, compatability with roof racks is nice and is a legitimate concern for the x but, is negated and then some by the huge difference in range and lack of fast charging infrastructure compared to Tesla, at least for the time being, so it's really lacking in terms of road trip viability compared to the model x. Now, as a car that's just a commuter vehicle, for someone that absolutely must have an SUV for a daily driver or frequently needs the storage space of a roof rack for trips within 75 miles, it makes a surprising amount of sense given that the owner cares more about the interior's comfort features than the model X's acceleration (entirely possible, even likely). Personally, as an engineering student, I have no problem with plastic on the inside because, for me, it doesn't detract much from the luxury of the vehicle, especially considering it was more likely chosen in a lot of places over aluminum to keep cost and weight down so more money could be put toward things like the safety features that are standard on every vehicle and aren't paid add-ons like the rear air bags are for the etron. Pleasant scents sounds like a lot of hooplah for an air freshener that only has to cost like 3 bucks and isn't hard to replace when the scent runs out. I don't see how Teslas' blindspot monitoring is any less ""real"" than Audi's since they both exist; Tesla's just isn't dependent on a separate specialized potential point of failure, I mean feature than the assisted driving functionality. Rear cross traffic alert is nice I'll give you that, maybe it'll be added in a software update, for now I'll probably just continue to back into spaces whenever possible like most people who are cautious of parking lot accidents. The 3D birds-eye parking is also pretty nice, especially for parallel parking where the proximity sensors might not detect the curb or show how close you are within a foot, maybe it'll be added eventually with an update but for now I'll admit that's a leg up. Tesla's Voice control is kind of garbage comparatively in terms of what you can do with it, so I'll definitely give you that one again, until a much needed expansion to it's functionality in Tesla's, same deal with carplay and Android auto. Panel gaps are no longer a significant issue and are negligible compared to other luxury auto manufacturers today. Overall, I'd even agree that it's a reasonable choice given the buyer is rich enough to buy a $73,000 car after tax refund (I included paid features to make it as comperable to the current base model X as possible because I didn't want to have to nitpick minor packages and I'm being pretty generous to count driver assist as comparable to autopilot) but somehow not also rich enough to spend $80,600 after incentives as per Tesla's website or doesn't have any usecase whatsoever for the almost 60% greater range and supercharger network. So I'm glad to hear that there at least is a usecase given a preference for Audi's interior over the supercharger network, while I'm obviously biased toward Tesla I do want EVs to succeed as a whole.  Unless you absolutely can't live without an SUV and don't plan on road tripping though, the model 3 has it beat in in way too many catagories, including price by a longshot no matter what configuration you get, when it comes to viability for a daily driver as long as you're not fanatically obsessed with having an SUV or any of the minor features the etron has that are holistically dwarfed by NoA alone. When the model Y comes out, you lose half the viability though."

"Right. I think they have the right to ask for money since they built them. They used their capital and had all the risk when they built up that network for their own cars. Every Tesla owner helped pay for that network when they bought their car. If another company wants to benefit, I think the manufacturer should invest something in it, too."

Also it's not like there are no high-speed CCS chargers. It's still slower than Tesla of course, but if you just need one charge/day it's likely still sufficient. They're less plentiful, but again as long as they are *sufficiently* plentiful that's good enough."

Would they be doing it without the settlement? Almost certainly not.

Would they slow down their electrification pace if some TSLA shorter got his hand on a genie and the resultant three wishes? Very probably.

Would they slow it down a ton to a snail's crawl? Honestly -- very possibly *not*. They're still being forced to make that investment, so slowing down too much means that money is going down the drain.

The problem is the average American outright neglects their vehicles and racks up a ton of miles. And when they do maintain their cars they use the cheapest components. I've serviced a ton of older 1.8T engines due to people using improper oil and pushing the oil change intervals too long, especially in the summer."
"I’m Canadian and my parents gave me a car to use last year, and I put 32,000km on it in under a year.

And I only use it when I can’t use my motorcycle.

That being said, it’s a 2008 Mercedes B200, and while super bare bones and a terrible car, it’s held up great with just oil changes.

No idea what’s the point of an economy car that takes premium though. Just costs me what it saves in being economical. 

I got it at 232k, it now has like 265k. 

Some sensors broke on it recently, so it kept telling me all the traction control shit was disabled, and sometimes wouldn’t want to shift out of park (unless I turned it on and off again), but I couldn’t figure out which because I don’t have the STAR diagnostic system, and was planning to get rid of it soon anyways (was buying a Lexus the next week).

The sensor problem seems to have resolved itself after 2 weeks, pretty stoked!

Especially because it’d be like $150 an hour for a Mercedes tech to diagnose it, for a car that’s worth like $2500 at best. 

Wish my BMW E90 had held up that well, got it at 160km, despite my religious maintenance at 180k it started to have mechanical issues, and continued to have regular mechanical issues until 215k when I sold it. Was just way too many repairs over 2 years, I had to give up."
"Anecdotal, but I've always meticulously maintained my vehicles and owned several German and several Japanese cars. The German cars always have had major mechanical repairs under warranty, and the Japanese cars never have a single mechanical problem. Not just the 4cyl eco cars, but our V6 van (currently at 120k) and V6 Lexus as well, zero issues. Meanwhile, my e46 melted a coil pack at about 10k, A4 2.0T kept failing vacuum tests or something, several repairs involved replacing various valves and seals (I didn't ask questions) and of course, eventually, the turbocharger. BMW N54 had cold-start issues due to its infamous HPFP, but never left me stranded (ironically the most reliable of the three). All of these were dealer serviced at scheduled intervals since new."
that isn't how we define reliability on this side of the lake
"All brands in the US had dealerships, the ""american"" brands aren't any better than everyone else.  Tesla is the only one with service issues right now.

That said, audi will probably do what GM did and require a certified EV mechanic.  Which would mean if anything outside brakes or suspension needs service, you can only go to dealers that have the certified guy on staff and only when he is working."
"So to Germans, ""reliability"" is how quickly it can be fixed after it broke rather than how few times it breaks?"
The CCS ballsack is such a terrible connector.
"Yeah, not talking about the Europe Tesla connector."
"There are 57,000 charging stations and only 13,000 of them are Tesla. Tesla needs other vehicles to use the supercharging network or simply take over all BEV and PHEV marketshare."
"Your first paragraph is completely wrong. EVgo chargers have CCS 1 connectors in addition to CHAdeMO, and the Electrify America network is hardly ""small""."
"The difference is that those other companies bake that into the price of using their chargers. Plus, those companies don't use the car to authenticate or authorize the purchase, they use the driver, who has to swipe a card or something. Tesla needs the user to have a vehicle which can handshake and authenticate as well as have a card on file."
"> iirc, they require signing a mutual patent exchange.

Does this cover SCs & SCing tho?  I heard the stuff about the open patents too but nothing concrete."
Yep. I was just trying to increase precision.
"Miles behind? Really? My M3 is quite decent in its interior quality. Anyways, as long as it is as good as it is right know, it is good enough for me. And probably a lot of other people... but yes, they could improve a few details. What is annoying me most is the road- and wind noise. That is something where I think they need to up their game."
"So you would pay 70k$ for a Mercedes interior on a horse carriage. I would not. Of course this is exaggerated, but you get my point. The EV power train is still more expensive then an ICE, so you cannot put in the same features and interior quality of you want to make money. Especially if the company is still young and working on getting production to work on this scale."
"You don't get my point? They're marketing to existing ev drivers, especially Tesla drivers. They're are trying to tell them their ev is not as good as the Audi, rather then convince a ICE driver their car is not as good. It's a desperate move to tap into Tesla's market."
Just because something is illegal doesn't mean most people would see it as unethical.
"Probably depends on the cop.  I'm sure there are many that would just tell the owner to move their vehicle and be on their way if they spotted them just idling there in a largely empty parking lot.  Of course, some would write the ticket regardless."

"I got a full length ladder into a corolla sedan.  The opening into the car is quite large and everything folds down.

As for a small fridge, transported those just fine in both a geo prism and a corolla.  Not sure why you think they cannot fit."
"He should maybe reply to this first...

https://twitter.com/bollingermotors/status/1030134716534587392"
"Not the Audi France Marketing Director, obviously..."
Which is kind of my point. The people who said it is a bad move would never have consider the Audi in the first place. Nothing to lose for them with those particular Tesla fans and owners.
"Define soon? Until Tesla can increase production 10 fold they aren’t going to have anywhere close to the majority of sales. There are roughly 17 million cars sold each year. Tesla is on track to build about 300k vehicles this 
year. That’s about 2%. They are dominating the EV segment, but the EV segment is tiny. If that segment is going to expand to be “the majority of vehicles” and Tesla wants to be a market leader than they need millions, not thousands. That’s 5-10 years out at the earliest. 

If that’s what you mean by “soon”, than yeah. But when you’re forecasting that far you gotta be careful. It remains to be seen if Tesla will stay the dominant player once traditional brands fully commit to the move to EVs."
"That is exactly my point, the representation is extremely disproportionate. I lived in Boston, now in D.C., and I'd say I see maybe 3-5 Teslas on my 21 mile commute. In LA, and certainly SF, you see several in a row at traffic lights."
Don't know which major cities you go to but pretty much everywhere I've been on the east coast has very few Teslas compared to the west coast.
"That very much depends. I understand that Europe uses the RON standard and America uses the RON/MON standard. But having done the math, most premium fuel in Europe would work out to 95-97 octane in RON/MON. Here in California at least, we get 91/92 max at the pump."
"I should have said most European engine.

Volkwagen seems to be the exception to what I said above. My GF has a Rabbit and it also takes regular."
"Maybe someone doesn't need speed or looks? You asked why someone would buy a vehicle that takes premium and is not a sports car. If you are truly interested in that question, read on. 
 The Volt: 
 - gets me to work and back on one charge
 - can be driven long range without the need for an additional charge
 - super low maintenance
 - super safe
 - can be bought used for $10k
 - quicker than my wife's Prius
 
I'm not overly concerned about vehicle looks or acceleration. So at that price point and those requirements, the Volt (at least three years ago when I bought it) was the best vehicle."
How much does gas (sorry petrol) cost in England?

"Now that's a fair reason, but doesn't really fit with the hypothetical scenario you gave.  :)

> if I had an hour commute each day, or spent the day driving around because I were a real estate agent, something like that -- day-to-day comfort would matter much more to me than the e-Tron's poor efficiency and rage [...] In that scenario, if I were in the market for a car in the upper tens-of-thousands, the e-Tron, i-Pace, and Model S would all be on my radar. (The 3 would not be."
"Do people say that?  ""I have a 5 mile 60 minute commute?"""
"To be honest... you're not doing a very good job of convincing me of the rationality of this decision.

From what I can tell, the last time free supercharging was offered with a Model 3 was before the mid-range version was introduced, which means I *think* everyone with free supercharging bought at least an LR 3 in price.

If we assume 18K miles at 300 Wh/mi and 15 cents/kWh, that gives $972/year. (18K miles is way above the median and above the mean annual mileage, 300 Wh/mi is 10% above the EPA estimate, and 15 cents/kWh above the national average and assumes no TOU plan.)

I don't want to say a thousand dollars a year is nothing -- though I will point out that to even get that due to supercharging you probably have to go way out of your way and give up one of the biggest benefits of EVs, charging at home and not having to go somewhere. But at the same time... if you're buying a car that is at *least* $50K and probably more (most cars with free supercharging are Ss or Xs), $1K/year is hopefully not anywhere make or break for you. And if you're price-conscious enough to care about that $1K/year, why the hell didn't you spend $15K or $20K for a great used car (including some (PH)EVs) and save $30K+ on your purchase price?? You could put that $30K into the stock market and the long-term average will return more money than you'd have saved on fuel. (Of course you'll say ""but there's other features of the car that's worth that amount."" Fine, but then can't you say the same thing about other options?)

Again, I'm not saying this 100% *always* applies. Maybe you drive insane amounts so even a reduction that is proportionally small is still a significant absolute amount. Maybe you're an apartment dweller who can't charge at home or at work and are relying on fast charging for your fillups. Maybe you just take a lot of long trips. But those are rare cases. More commonly, I can certainly see free supercharging or fastcharging costs being maybe a tiebreaker, and certainly a nice *perk* of the choice. But I reiterate my view -- I think that if you care about the cost difference between supercharging and Electrify America enough for it to be a significant factor, either you're in a weird position with regards to your level 3 charging needs or you're spending a dollar to save a penny."
"The settlement was giving billions to other companies for infrastructure.  VW can't own it, that wouldnt be a sentencing it would just be building VW infrastructure."
Oh I agree. The settlement forced their hand on what was coming anyways. The settlement was a good one IMHO as it wasn't purely a punishment. It gave VW an upside if they chose to use it as such.
"We will see as soon as the court ordered settlement terms are met.  They could stop investing in the networks and see if theyfail, they should just keep it going and sell more cars."
Its actually more than valid comment.
Read the thread again.
"Wow, you are *shockingly* misinformed. Firs the bullshit about EA being small and nothing else having CCS1 connectors, and now claiming that Chinese buyers get cash-based govt incentives? Had you not heard that China stopped giving cash incentives for EVs last year? They moved their incentive program to other emerging technology, because EVs are well-established there, and don't need such incentives any longer.

There are non-cash incentives (like ability to register an EV without having to win a lottery), but not rebates."
"Can confirm, American here only did my second oil change on my Golf TDI at 37k, and did literally nothing to it for a couple years (except maybe fill the wiper fluid?).  In the end it worked out as VW bought it back from me for a ridiculous amount of money because of dieselgate. All said that golf was an amazing car and took all the abuse I threw at it."
[deleted]
"No. But it is a big factor. Cars can break, any brand, any car. On some most reliable car brand lists audi is one of the top car brands. I for myself dont have any really reliable data at hand that i can say ""car brand xy is the most reliable"" or something else. Even if you look online, you will find 10 people and each and every one of them will name a different car brand as the best. So what counts at the end of the day? Whenever your car breaks, you want it fixed asap. And that is guaranteed for audi in germany at least. 

And tesla got a freaking bad reputation in germany. Mostly false claims from the media, but people in the media and trust them...Sadly."
Why?
"What it loses in looks it gains in flexibility, tho."
"I mean Ionity chargers use CCS and charge at 350kw.

When Tesla one can do that it would be cool but it cannot."
"lol, 50kw charging stations don't count.  No sane person is traveling using those.

Also, do not count destination chargers, those have no bearing on ability to travel.  They just let you charge when you get somewhere.  A short range EV that is going somewhere with a destination charger can only drive as far as their car's initial range.  250mi isn't traveling.

If you want to know the true state of charging in the US, count the number of +150kw chargers that actually enable traveling.

Your number are fake because you include useless chargers.  PHEV have nothing to do with anything here, we are talking EVs.  EV = BEV.  No one cares about hybrids that don't even need to plugin.

There is only one EV on the market that can rely on gas away from home, that is the volt.  It is an EV with a ICE range extender.  All other cars are ICE cars that just get assistance from an electric motor and any EV modes they have are gimmicks that cannot even handle normal acceleration or speeds above 20mph.  The volt has an EV drivetrain first, that can be supplemented with the secondary ICE with both mechanical force and electricity generation.  A volt drives like an EV even when the ICE engine kicks on, because the electric motor is the main drive motor and there is no transmission."
"EA is absolutely small.  4 +150kw chargers were stop is a joke.  Tesla has stops with 40 chargers that have lines.

EA is not designed for any real capacity and they won't install any chargers not mandated by the government's settlement.

Not only are there few 150kw chargers, but people in chevy bolts are using them to get 60kw instead of 50kw.  So have fun waiting for a chevy bolt to finish before your 150kw e-tron can start charging.  They are also down a lot and there is no way to know in advance if they are down, people have filmed trips on youtube and posted accounts on reddit about how unreliable public chargers are.

I find it odd people lie about EA and pretend it is more than it is.  The fact is there is no tesla competitor in the US until another company starts building chargers at the same level tesla is building them.

If you think EA is so great, go buy a non-tesla and report back how great it is."
"Yes, but they lag quite a lot. Already in 2014, Mercedes headlights could selectively put ""black holes"" around other cars and provide high beam-level lighting everywhere else. Interior features, from accent lighting to storage to materials and trim is visibly worse. Features like ventilated or massage seats which improve driving comfort are unavailable, and other features like head-up displays continue to develop rapidly in other cars while being absent in Tesla. And that says nothing of things like high-speed driving dynamics. 

I've driven current-generation Audis, BMWs, and Mercedes back-to-back with Tesla. In most ways, the Tesla is a superior car and the car of the future. But it's not as clear in terms of features or driving feel many here would argue.

I love Tesla. They will succeed, and they get better every month and every year. But not looking at competition makes it more difficult to eclipse them in all aspects."
"I don’t dispute the advantages of EVs, but there is totally a market segment that usually buys $50k+ European luxury vehicles that would take an Audi over a Tesla even if the Audi has worse EV specs."
"Were excatly are they doing this in this video?

Please watch the video. They are at a ordinary Mc Donald's parking lot. They aren't at some parking lot that's Tesla exclusive. You can see 6 spots for EVs, where two are taken by Teslas and one by Audi.

You can also see dozens of ordinary ICE cars.


What makes you think they would only be there to advertise to the 2 Tesla drivers, when there are 30 ICE drivers?"
"It's the principle and rule of law we are arguing here. Yes technically they aren't  completely stopping Tesla owners from charging but they still are blocking one potential access to the chargers.

Your argument is flawed because I can apply your argument to someone's driveway. Yes you can park there and move at any time, but you are still on someone's property where you don't belong in. Sure there is no harm initially until traffic sets in and people assume you belong in that spot or are trespassing."

"Corolla is a hatchback though...

And I don't see how you fir [this](https://www.koolatron.com/ca/content/images/thumbs/0000958_coors-light-compact-mini-fridge-90-litre-small-refrigerator.jpeg) into a geo prism."
"I'd have considered an Audi in a hot minute. I adored my A4, and the new A3 is tight as hell looking. Too bad they're so late to this party."
"You're spot on. 5 years at least before Tesla makes a serious dent in ICEV.

Serious dent is about 1mn cars a year which is about 6% of cars sold. I feel when you add other car models that are EV it will be like 10% of ICEV.

And that cycle will accelerate exponentially faster. So the jump from 10% to 50% will take another decade and to 90% maybe a quarter of a century.

There will be holdouts for sure but tipping point is 50-50 which imo is around 15 years from now.

All that is needed is mass production that leads to cheaper cost.

The ICEV cos have 0 incentive to push for it while Tesla and Rivian and others will push harder which spurs the laggard ICEVs cos further.

Couple that with climate changing already and the push will emerge.

Lone pushbacks are oil industry, car dealerships and need to market who want their inventory gone and for them to remain in power. Tesla has already shown you don't need any of the 3.

It's literally a dinosaur vs giant robot fight. And dinosaurs will go extinct again as the fossil fuel industry will be a figment of human  history before the century is over."
"Hmm, I need to play the counting game again.  I haven't done it since well before the model 3 shipments started and my best was 122 Teslas in \~34 mile round trip commute (SF penninsula area).  Might see that many model 3s now."
"Boston MA, Burlington MA, Durham NC, Richmond VA, and Fort Lauderdale FL. Not including the ones I see on the highways in-between. These are parked or on the city streets. Granted Durham didn't have the same density as the others but this was months ago and 10's of thousands of new Model 3's have been put on the road since."
Pretty much every source says 95 and 98 RON is about 91 and 93 RON/MON. California not having 93 is the exception not the rule.
Oh right the golfs are made in Mexico huh
"Supermarket petrol is around is £1.25/litre and branded like shell is around £1.30/litre

So for Americans converted it's about $5.80/US gal

It adds up fast."
"I was more thinking that the hypothetical would be more like what I currently drive *plus* add in that commute.

In addition to that, maybe saying the 3 ""wouldn't be on my radar"" was a bit harsh; I don't think I'd discount it outright. But unlike what looks like something close to a three-way tossup between the e-Tron, i-Pace, and Model S, I think the chance it would wind up being the 3 is very low, because I strongly suspect I'd take the S over the 3. The tradeoffs between the 3 and S are a lot less... tradeoff-y than the others and I *think* it'd be easier to predict. I could say something similar for the X; I'd look, but am fairly sure I'd prefer the S. It's also possible that if I actually saw an e-Tron or i-Pace in person that would pretty quickly make up my mind, probably against if it was quick; but I've only seen the 3 and S out of that list, and maybe an X."
"I mean, 5 miles in 60 minutes would really bad (though I don't know what it's like in a big city, I bet it's realistic for some), but I could see 20 miles in an hour or something like that pretty easily. (My commute for a few months was 30 minutes one way at less than 20 mph average.) Or maybe you have 10 minutes of stop and go to get to a highway, 30 minutes of two-lane 55 mph speed limit highway and then 20 minutes to go 5 miles back in traffic.

One other thing that I was going to edit into my previous comment: And I'm not even saying you'd necessarily even *prefer* the e-Tron if it works for you; maybe you're one of the people who actually loves Tesla's interior and design aesthetic and if you even think there are any compromises in the first place you think they're worth it. And that's fine! My points are just that (i) it's not remotely unreasonable for someone to prefer interior comfort and luxury to better range and efficiency (people have been doing this for *ages*), (ii) there are plenty of people who *would* prefer the e-Tron in that case, and (iii) there are tons of realistic scenarios where people would be *fine* with the e-Tron's range. I mean, heck, the Leaf is still the best selling EV cumulative, and until the very latest 60 kWh Leaf, the Leaf makes the e-Tron's range look great."
"You are missing the point. You make a good argument but people don’t buy a 70k+ car to make a good financial decision. They are coming from a gas car and even though they charge most at home that though, “oh I can charge for free when ever at a Supercharger “ they don’t do the math like you and I have, they just associate it with getting free fuel and that’s usually a huge cost to them coming from a gas car so it helped to sell a lot of Model s/x. 

The big thing for me, I bought electric because I hated gas, but I bought a Tesla because it IS the best car for me on the road currently. That includes the fact that long distance travel is less than the cost of gas on most cars. I have no incentive to buy an etron for fuel savings since I’d be better off with a gas car or a plug in hybrid. That’s not what “we” want to promote electric adoption. Electric needs to be cheaper to operate in every way than a gas car, there shouldn’t be any weakness for people to focus on.

I’m about to take a 4000 mile road trip to Canada, if I didn’t have 6000 free Supercharger miles to use it’ll only cost me a couple hundred assuming all supercharging and no hotels or camp grounds. The etron, not only would that trip be miserable long between crappy range and no autopilot, but likely cost 1k in fuel costs. That’s more than it would cost my friend to take his truck camper and Diesel truck that get 12mpg the whole way..."
Hey sorry to bug you. Who was your jaw surgeon and what did you get done?
Not when he claims the guy made it up just because it was on teslarati.
"lol, you are ignoring the reality of EV sales so far.

Tesla 100% is charging more for the model 3.  Go look it up, everyone agrees the price is very high, but it is absolutely taking the tax credit into account.  They are a premium brand so they aren't going to immediately drop the price as much as possible.  If they sell out capacity at the higher price, that is where it will stay.

Everyone did the same thing in the US.  You think it is a coincidence that tesla has been able to cut prices as they lost the tax credit?  Q3 and Q4 were absolutely left with higher prices due to the tax credit.  They didn't just magically cut costs at the start of Q1 2019."
There was a long time that Americans wouldn't put american cars at the top of that list either. But they seem to have turned themselves around after they all ( yes yes except Ford) went Bankrupt. That was a huge wake up call to them. Most people here I know prefer Japanese cars over American.
"> Both sides seems to be partial/patriotic.. That said, ask any non-German European, and they will probably put American cars at the bottom,

I can only speak for a slice of the US, but it's not patriotism that I see; I don't think American cars are regarded as reliable. As the other reply said, it's Japanese brands that appear at the top of the list. I strongly suspect that if you asked a ton of us about which was the most reliable brand, Toyota would be the most common answer.

I know Consumer Reports gets a bad rap around here, but the top five brands on its reliability scores are Toyota, Subaru, Lexus, Mazda, and Hyundai for 2019. I will caution that there is a fair bit of movement across places from year to year.

That being said, Audi actually does reasonably well -- it's #7, and was #3 or #4 last year, out of 28 total. (I can't tell if ↓3 means that it moved down three spots or moved down from #3.)"
"Sorry, but german cars are at the bottom along with Fiat. Japanese cars are at the top. I drive german."
"Yeah we’ve got plenty of Audi dealerships in any major city too.

But I’m not paying someone $150 an hour to chase down electrical gremlins every few months.

We also have shit transit in North America, so we’re going to need a loaner too."
It's *huge*!
How so? The Tesla connector does all the same stuff.
"> There is only one EV on the market that can rely on gas away from home, that is the volt. It is an EV with a ICE range extender. All other cars are ICE cars that just get assistance from an electric motor and any EV modes they have are gimmicks that cannot even handle normal acceleration or speeds above 20mph. 

You have a wholly incorrect view on PHEVs.

The ability to drive under normal conditions and normal speeds entirely on electricity until the battery depletes is an entirely *common* aspect of PHEVs now. The vast vast majority of trips I take in my C-Max Energi (better than 90%) have no engine use, and I'm at close to 160 mpg over the last 1600 or so miles. That includes trips that have short jaunts on freeways up to at least 60 mph (I'm not sure if I've taken it out on the 70 interstate on EV only). I can floor the gas pedal for as long as I have the guts to and it will not kick on the engine in most cases (it will if it's cold, but the Volt's ERDTT means that it's not immune to cold weather annoyances either).

That describes most PHEVs today, if not virtually all."
50kw!?! Lol. Most are sub 10kW. But that is still a significant number of charging stations to counter that your plug ought to be standard even though it's the minority and isn't open sourced to everyone.
"I completely agree with your comment. I had Audis for years and still own a Q5 s-line as well as a model 3. The audi interior, wind noise, door shutting smoothness and overall comfort make me wish that Audi would have come out with a fully electric A4 that wasn't garbage. It's a real shame there isnt more competition in high end electric sedans already.

Most people that own Model 3s, for whatever reason, defend them beyond reason. I love it, but I do miss several audi (premium auto company) features."
"We had a BMW M2 with the adaptive high beam assist, which was really nice. I got my Model X which didn't have that, so I missed it. But I hated the engine in the M2 (or rather the M-DCT automatic gearbox which introduces a lag which you don't have in an EV) so I never drove it again.

&#x200B;

Just before we replaced our M2 with a Model 3 Performance, I had one last drive with the M2 at night. I quickly noticed that yes, it still had the adaptive auto high beams, but in reality the xenon bulbs were less bright than the all LED array in my Model X. I'd love to believe that BMW's or Mercedes' LED offering are better now, but that one last experience put me off our M2 completely.

&#x200B;

All in all, what German brands feel is important (among others a giant list of options, priced 300€ or more per option) is stuff I do not feel important anymore. Sure, I can't have cooled seats, but with a 100kWh battery I can turn on the airconditioning when I'm about to leave which makes my car already cool so it makes cooled seats redundant. All active safety options are pretty much standard on a Tesla, while they're 300€ each at BMW, and at Tesla they work unlike BMW where even lane assist is a pipe dream. I don't want buttons if it means I get a stack of fake buttons and a small screen with outdated map data, and a navigation knob which is just not easy to navigate. And I don't miss a head-up display because my car takes care of the driving and is pretty good at it. It even takes exits automatically."
Head-up displays are unnecessary. The selective headlights are nice. But does an Audi have reclining seats like a Rolls-Royce? A mini bar? All the luxury features? I think a 45k$ Mercedes C-class doesn’t have that either. The price of a Tesla EV is for the unreached quality and performance of the drivetrain and safety/autonomy features. Not for a Rolls-Royce interior.
"Which it does have... it’s ok, they can buy whatever they want. I rather have the better and future proof EV."
"I don't know what video you're referring to, but the one in the story and linked in this sub shows an etron parked at a Tesla charger, so..."
"> Your argument is flawed because I can apply your argument to someone's driveway. Yes you can park there and move at any time, but you are still on someone's property where you don't belong in. Sure there is no harm initially until traffic sets in and people assume you belong in that spot or are trespassing.

Well yes- that's my point, and that's the distinction people are missing.  If someone parks in my driveway, I'm not going to be concerned about having to maneuver my car around them.  I've had to do that with the UPS truck before, and it's not a big deal.  I would be annoyed, however, if someone was trespassing on my property without permission/good reason.  Whether they're in a car or not is really irrelevant.

Likewise, I find it pretty distasteful to go to a competitor's place of business and directly solicit their customers, which is what Audi is doing.  The fact that they're taking up one of many available charging spots?  I don't care.  Nobody is being inconvenienced by that, and I'm sure they'd quickly move if someone needed the spot.

Perhaps another analogy- someone stops at the gas station late at night, pumps gas, and walks into the station to shop, get a bite to eat, etc.  They don't bother to move their car to a space by the storefront away from the pump before they do so.  Do people generally make a big deal about someone doing that?  Nope, because there are still a dozen pumps available, and nobody is inconvenienced.

"> You are missing the point. You make a good argument but people don’t buy a 70k+ car to make a good financial decision.

But then why care about the small added cost of EA's charges? If you're willing to say ""I'm gonna spend $70K to get this cool toy"", why is ""I'm gonna spend a little bit more to get this cooler toy"" (*if* you like the e-Tron or whatever for whatever reason) not completely natural? *That* is the part that I say I have a hard time wrapping my head around.

>  they don’t do the math like you and I have

So wait... is someone going to do the math to look up supercharging costs vs Electrify America costs or not?

If anything, ...

> they just associate it with getting free fuel 

... I think actually reinforces that this probably won't matter much in most cases. The difference between ""free"" and ""not free"" is often more viscerally compelling than ""cheap"" and ""expensive"". 

> Electric needs to be cheaper to operate in every way than a gas car, there shouldn’t be any weakness for people to focus on.

Except I think that's a pipe dream for now, at least some of the time. Maybe I'm switching to an extreme here, but the trip I've done almost every year for more than a decade to visit family at Christmas is a long day's drive in an ICE car. The cheapest BEV that I think has a reasonable chance of doing that in a day is the $50K LR 3. I know you said ""operate"", but of course ignoring the purchase price is just as silly as ignoring the operating cost when figuring out the affordability of a BEV. Even the LR 3/S would add close to an hour, making it a *loooooong* day. (The SR+ adds about two, and that'd definitely push it beyond what I can do in a day.)

Finally, to directly address EA's fairly high prices -- while I don't have a BEV (BEVs and I are unusually poorly suited for each other), if I did I'd actually *rather* spend a couple hundred more each year as a direct incentive to both expand faster and better maintain their chargers, as opposed to relying the network to be built on the basis of ""what will be good enough that people consider the network an advantage when buying our cars."""

"> You have a wholly incorrect view on PHEVs.

lol!

PHEVs are a joke.  You ever drive one?

ERDTT is easily bypassed with a dongle on ebay, it is just a software bug.  The newest volt doesn't start ERDTT until you are sub zero, Gm realize it was stupid to turn it on when they did.

The volt is a true EV with a gas range extender, period.  You don't get to lie about it.

>The vast vast majority of trips I take in my C-Max Energi (better than 90%) have no engine use

You lie. 7.6 kWh lithium-ion.  You would have god awful acceleration and probably cannot go faster than 35mph and stay in EV mode. It also has a CVT transmission, the volt has no transmission.  The ICE cannot function in the volt without the electric motors because it has to power one of them to generate electricity and the other handles acceleration because there is no transmission for shifting for the ICE.  The ICE only assists the electric motor.

Hybrids like your ford are ICE cars first, with electric assist."
"lolwut?

So you are telling me you actually tried to say there are lots of chargers because of sub 10kw chargers at people's homes?  You insane?

None of these chargers are CCS1 combo, they are all j1772 which is obsolete.  Cars with j1772 cannot use combo chargers since they lack the space for the dc pins below the charge port.

Chademo is dead, all those cars need adapters.  Chademo has more chargers than CCS1 combo too.  Why can we kill chademo, but not CCS1 combo?

If VW never cheated emissions, EA wouldn't exist, and then there wouldn't be any CCS1 combo chargers in the US at all."
"What country are you in? The M2 doesn't have a particularly strong headlight system, not comparable with higher-series models, and BMW << Audi Matrix < Mercedes Multibeam.

It's a matter of preferences, I suppose: the way an M2 still pulls at 200km/h is intoxicating to me. Heads up displays are just super informative for all the situations that Autopilot can't yet cover. And the current gen of other tech is good that I certainly don't fumble with outdated maps and the like when I drive another car (usually rentals on business trips)."
"Lots of apple to oranges comparisons in this thread.

"A head-up display might be unnecessary to you, but that’s just you doing some personal value-judgment. A lot of car buyers like to have fancy features and they’ll simply not consider buying a car if it doesn’t offer what they are looking for.

Here in reality, none of these cars would be on my radar if I was shopping. Not only are there only very rare circumstances where I'd consider a car in the price range of the LR 3 or more (think hours in the car each day), but as I've said many times in prior threads, I am unusually poorly suited for any BEV, so what would get me to buy one is wholly unrealistic at this time. (For purposes of this discussion, an ideal confluence of factors would be something like a Kona or Niro with the battery of a LR Model 3 or S. I could also say ""think of a Model Y"", but this both gives up some things that I consider somewhat important and also brings in a connotation of Tesla-like performance, which I don't really care about. Then, drop the price $15K below a LR Model 3. That's about when I'd start investigating with a serious eye towards figuring out whether I should buy.)

(Also, in terms of ""hey just go drive one, it wouldn't hurt"", the closest Tesla store is a couple hours away.)"
"Not going to argue you this any more, but speaking from me personally cost to charge matters A LOT since after October 1/3 of my miles will be Supercharger miles. And besides the point I’ve watched reviews and even got to see an etron in person, it doesn’t compare to a Tesla to me. Tesla is so far a head for me personally I can’t see what moron would pay 30k for “better interior” which in my opinion is not better. 

Enough said, if I wanted to be frugal about this , I would have got a used Chevy volt for 15k, but I wanted the cheapest car that could replace a gas car completely and a Tesla Model 3 Long Range was just that. I’m also assuming FSD will happen at sole point while I own this car and that’s worth A LOT to me so the over all value proposition for me personally is good with this car."

"> PHEVs are a joke. You ever drive one?

I own one, as I said. Have *you* ever driven one?

PHEVs are great and get you many of the benefits of a BEV at a fraction of the cost of a long range one.

> ERDTT is easily bypassed with a dongle on ebay, it is just a software bug. 

I could probably improve a similar aspect with my car as well and make it a little more reluctant to pop on the engine in cold weather. But you also can't just say ERDTT was a *bug*, it was a deliberate design decision. Just because they changed it later doesn't mean it was a bug.

>  7.6 kWh lithium-ion. You would have god awful acceleration

0-60 time is pretty terrible on EV mode. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHp5b5wB6rI) shows it to be around 15 seconds.

That being said:

* I don't really care about performance. Is it quick enough to be safe? Yes? Then it's fine for me.
* I've never had a problem with it in practice. (That said, there are some places that are not where I live with terrible on-ramps where it could easily be a problem. Still, overall that's the exception, not the rule IMO.)
* The 0-30 time is actually pretty fine, in generally the same ballpark as many mass-market cars.

Finally, I'll point out that you have now repeatedly stated that PHEVs are *incapable* of highway speeds on EV only. As that video demonstrates, that is just flat out wrong. You're either woefully misinformed or outright lying. (And I can point you at citations for other cars; e.g. [here](https://youtu.be/hyNsQ99yq10?t=238) is Alex on Autos discussing that the Prius Prime will run up to 84 mph in EV only mode and will stay in that mode even if you put the pedal to the floor.) And as my own experience illustrates, short jaunts on the freeway on EV work fine; the biggest problem is just that it runs down the battery like there's no tomorrow.

> Hybrids like your ford are ICE cars first, with electric assist.

Mechanically that's true. Practically... I strongly disagree. As a user of the car, I primarily care about whether I can run successfully in EV mode when driving locally. Can I? The vast majority of the time, the answer is yes, [and my tripodometer proves it](https://i.imgur.com/0th9pfz.png).

(For another way of looking at my numbers -- 1,616 miles at 158.7 mpg means I've used 10.2 gallons since resetting that back in January. Even if I assume I got the EPA 39 MPG for those gallons (no way did I get that, a *lot* of that are from winter when it was butt cold and the engine was getting pretty terrible mileage while it warms up) that would have taken me 397 miles, less than 25% of the miles I've driven. So a fairly pessimistic estimate is that driving around town, 75% of the miles are EV only. In reality, decent chance it's north of 80%.)

(*Edit*: And to wrap back around to other things I said earlier, the above is by *miles*, but that doesn't directly correspond to *trips* -- a single trip that has the engine used at all is fairly likely to have it on for a few miles. So even though the number of *miles* on EV is probably between 75% and 80%, the number of trips is higher, almost certainly above 90%.)

As far as I care, the biggest difference (and shortcoming) between my car and the Volt isn't about the configuration of the drivetrain or anything, it's simply the battery capacity. I usually get 20-30 miles on a full charge depending on season and my route, and I don't like to charge to 100% because I really don't trust my car's BMS and whether I have an adequate buffer. (I guess that's shortcoming #2 on my list compared to the Volt.) That *is* enough for me to do the vast majority of stuff I want to do around town, but sometimes only barely and sometimes only if I forego stuff like climate control.

I'd *love* to have twice the battery capacity and would have paid a couple thousand more for it even, but that's because I want a little more range and the ability to not have to make some of those compromises, not because it'd give better acceleration or enable a different drivetrain or anything like that. And would I trade it for a Volt? Never; the form factor advantage of my car is too great, and on a personal note I found the Volt's seats *incredibly* uncomfortable. (I didn't like that aspect of the test drive so I sat in one for about three hours one Saturday, and for the rest of the day every time I sat down I internally groaned because my butt was still sore from the morning's test.)"
"I get it. You're excited about Tesla superchargers. I'm pointing out what is stopping Tesla's proprietary plug becoming the standard. I'm not talking about people's homes, I'm talking about the charging at shopping centers etc. None of them really offer more than 240V/40A. That's 8kW. I don't disagree with anything that you said. It's just a numbers game. They spammed the country with junk plugs and that's a lot for Tesla to overcome. Either they corner the plug market or allow others to adopt their plug. Those are the only way Tesla plug becomes standard."
"The facelift M2 didn't even come with high beam assistance like the pre-facelift xenon system...
And it might pull nicely at +200km/h but a Model 3 does that too, and I don't live in Germany so we get about 3 times a year we're allowed to do 200km/h. And honestly, it's more fun to just put autopilot on at 150 than to go 200+. There are no prices to be won on the autobahn...

I end up in rentals too, and I absolutely hate them. Sure, the navigation works, but it's shit if you're used to Tesla and Waze."
"My point was, that you can always have more and better things. But Tesla’s are more expensive with less of those features because other stuff in the car is more expensive. And i agree, they can improve on many fronts, but they are a relatively new company and are leading the EV market. They, for good reasons, focused on other stuff then fancy massage seats."
"Ok, agreed..."
"Odd, maybe I don't notice them. I used to live in Newton, then Acton, but I went back to the Newton/Brookline/Cambridge area somewhat often and never noticed there being a lot of them."
"Portability of what? The connector doesn't move anywhere, unless you're talking about an adapter.

Ease of operation? ""Sick it into the the socket"" is exactly the same on connector type."
"No one is reading all that drivel.  You lied.  That small battery cannot sustain highway speeds and will require slower acceleration. Thus it is a gimmick EV mode just like the prius.

The car's drivetrain is still an ICE one with an EV addon.  The volt is the opposite, the ICE engine int he volt cannot power the car alone, the motors have to be working because the electric motor handles the torque even when the batteries are drained.  It is a well designed range extender."
"lol, you don't get anything.

No one is traveling on slow chargers, period.

We cannot have more EVs until any non-tesla company starts building chargers at the same rate as tesla.  You are pretty pathetic that you have to prevent someone wanting more public chargers is somehow only worried about tesla.

If you only care about tesla, you could care less if anyone else makes chargers, you have them."
"Again, preferences. But to be clear: an M2 wipes the floor with any Tesla above 200."
On all points I agree. =) I just wanted to dispel the initial notion from OP that Tesla is superior in all respects.
"> because other stuff in the car is more expensive

Like what compared to the e-tron?"
"Adapters, portable charging kits, and the connector still has weight even if it's fixed to a cable somewhere.

The Tesla connector is easily a one-handed operation. CCS is a two-handed beast."
"Probably true, but the driver of the M2 would be driving himself and the driver of the Tesla would be a comfortable passenger. I recently did 1800km through Germany with a Tesla and I’m never going back to driving 250 on the A9, although once upon a time I had 2 M’s to do that. It’s just ridiculously unsafe and you’re exposing yourself and others to so much risk for little reward..."
"that's a good question. My hunch is that tesla knew we would all be so excited about the tech (aka big screen), range and auto drive that we would be willing to give up the missing higher end items. That's the smart business decision - sucks for us tesla owners that miss some of those features, but makes sense from a business stand point. But man oh man do I miss the simple little feature of blind spot lights on the side view mirrors.... talk about first world problems. 

In 5 years all of these companies are going to have some amazing cars out there. It's pretty exciting to watch.  I'd be just as excited to get an Audi or Merc if it was better for me so I don't care who wins as long as the cars keep getting better."
Never heard of a portable charging kit. What's that?
A mobile connector?
"Ohhh, I had assumed from the name that it was like, a battery that you connected to your car to extend range. Which obviously made no sense, so I had to ask. lol"
That’s awesome!! How long will the battery last?
Cant wait for mine to arrive!
"That's awesome.  I live in Northern Australia and had a similar experience when we were hit by floods earlier this year.  

One thing though is that it had been really wet and heavily overcast for the weeks leading up and despite having a 13.2kw array on the roof the battery was sitting at about 5%. As conditions continued to deteriorate we had a fair indication that grid infrastructure was going under and power loss was likely. 

What we did was go into the app and switch the battery to backup mode and specified that it reserve 100% for power outages. The battery then charged itself to 100% from the grid and when the power failed we had enough power in the battery to get us through until the grid was restored and the battery charged itself to 100% again.  

As soon as the sun started shining went back into the app and switched it back to self powered and it resumed charging from the PV."
It sounds wrong but blackouts help powerwall growth
Is charging Powerwall batteries to 100% bad in the same way Tesla doesn't recommend charging their cars to 100% ?
What is the price of that system of yours?

"Our electric bill ranges around $100\~ month.   New house so very energy efficient, I like the idea of a powerwall and solar but it seems like the powerwall just itself assuming 2 powerwalls + install would take about 171 months to pay for itself.   Not including solar installation, permits, equipment, etc.

I'm guessing this just makes senses for people who have high electric bills and/or long-time outages?"

"Unfortunately (as far as I know) in Italy we can't do that, for safety reasons... We have 3 powerwalls but if the power goes down they turn off!"
"Hey guys I have just started looking into power walls, a couple of questions.

How do you charge the powerwall? Is it compatible with non-tesla solar panels ?

How many power walls are recommended for a new 2200 sqft Bay Area home ?

Bay Area receives good amount of sunlight throughout the year hence I assume you would be left with credits that you can use for your night use and hence is powerwall a necessity for saving costs ?"
"Damn I want this for my house someday, didn't realize how insanely expensive it was now though. 10k per battery and they don't even say how much the solar costs, but I guess everyone's roof is different so that's why."
"Still waiting on that solar roof. Last I heard the holdup was longevity testing, which makes sense."
"hahaa thats my dream  .  the power company has been warning about planned outages for ""safety"" or something.

i want the power to go out  so the neighborhood is pitch black , then the neighbors to look out the window and see im still on and think..oh it must be me... so they all go waste 15 minutes playing with their breaker box.    

then i can let them in on the joke."
Hopefully in a few years the cost of the Powerwall will drop to something around $5000. At that point I’ll be getting two and sticking them in the house. Just had a 22 panel array put on the roof that can generate just under 40kWh a day.  We netmeter back most of that back to the power company. Does wonders for the monthly bill. Would really like to store some of that instead and keep the house off the grid as much as possible. Small steps.

We actually had to film it twice since we even missed it the first time lol

Gosh it's going to get weird if the grid goes down for a month and people with power walls turn into gods of their neighbourhood.
Does your app always show the PW % below the green powerwall circle?
Nice one man. Just an extra benefit from the powerwall. Serious bit of kit.
"Holy shit it hadn't even occurred to me that you would have power through a black out!

Can I get a power wall even without solar?
Got the panels installed last week. Now waiting for all the inspections to go through. Really hoping I don’t regret not getting a powerwall.
"Just cause I'm bad at maths, how long will a powerwall last fully charged using normal electricity in house."
Very nice 👌
"Isn't it great??

I know when mine goes out, because I have a UPS hooked up to my stereo. The power stays up, but the UPS doesn't like it for some reason so beeps.

That beep is the only way I know my power is out, which is good. I go around and turn off unneccessary loads so the batteries (2x powerwalls) will last longer.

The most important thing is to stop my car from charging. That will drain the powerwalls in no time."
"Hol up! 


The powerwall is a battery pack for the house?! I thought it just stored the solar energy to charge the car. 

I swear every week I see something new that makes me love Tesla more."
It’s such a shame there isn’t the ability to use a Tesla as a battery backup in outages.
This makes me really want to get a system like this.
"It's my dream, my own UPS for the entire house. But first I should get my own house and stop renting."
I want this so bad it hurts. It’s wonderful being smug about being green when you can rub an obvious advantage like this in people’s faces. This is how you get them to come around-envy.
"I'm with you bro! Similar experience, but I was outside in the evening when I was building my deck had the lights on and using power tools etc, didn't even notice the grid down. 

We live in a small street, only a few houses, and when the solar team came to install way back when our bad neighbours made a song and dance about all the noise... So the first time I noticed the power had gone out, I stood on my porch, facing their house turning my porch light on and off as if to prove I won :)"
"Wait a moment, so the power wall is able to power the house completely, or only the essentials?"
"Do you have and APC or CyberPower UPSes in your house? If it's daytime and the sun is out and the batteries are full, the powerwall generates 65Hz and my UPSes switch to internal power and start beeping like crazy."
You go with Tesla solar panels? I was all on board until I found out they used string inverters instead of micro inverters. That's what sold me on my current system with momentum Solar.
"What's the grid policy? 

I priced out a solar system in a net metering (at retail) state and was advised by the installer to not put in battery backup and if I cared about power when the grid was down to install a gas generator."
You are living the dream! What was your neighbors reaction when you explained to him how you have power? How long was your power out? Why made you decide to get 2 power walls instead of one?
We have laws here in Florida that require the system to shit off if we lose grid power. Makes solar useless in a power outage.
So they also work as a generator if u lose power?
When the hell are we going to start being able to use solar in a grid down situation.  This has got to be a big energy plot because they know the next logical step is for people to not have the grid at all.
There's a thing called 'Inverter' thats sold all over the world. Not sure why Amuricans are not aware of it. You buy it with battery for power storage. It's usually far cheaper than Tesla WP.
"We have 2 Powerwalls at 13.5 kWh each & a 6.6 kW Solar system. On a typical night, the system will go down to about 75% by the time the sun hits the panels at 6:50am and is fully recharged by 11:55am."
"Just to add:

The most energy we have used on a single day in the past week is 24.4 kWh. That’s on a 1,700+ sqft home from the 90’s, with AC running in 100+°F weather, and 4 people living in the home. At 27kWh of total storage, it would take an unbelievably cloudy week or prolonged solar eclipse to leave us completely without power since the batteries will fully recharge daily."
"If you're talking lifetime, Tesla warrant for 10 years, but life expectancy is 20-25."
"Totally worth it! We have been completely off PG&E for the 23 days since Permission to Operate! Depending on how many Powerwalls you have installed & the capacity of your panels, it may take a full day or two for the solar system to charge the batteries to 100%. Once they are there though, it is really a challenge to get even close to 50% drain for us. Truly amazing!"
Eagerly awaiting mine since September 2017.
"Awesome that it has such flexibility and you can control it so simply 💯

Does the app connect directly to the walls via wifi? If power goes out, the walls kick in and keep the wifi running I assume?"
Assuming from North QLD area then due to floods. Who did you use to install and how much did it set you back?
Australia and Puerto Rico agree.
Brownouts even more though!
[deleted]
The system always automatically charges the batteries to 100% daily. There aren’t any options to limit the charging capacity of the batteries so I would have to assume that it is not an issue; the system is completely independent & you don’t have control over that like you do with the vehicles.
"Good question; the powerwalls use a different battery chemistry than the cars. The cars are made for instantaneous maximum draw for acceleration and regeneration, the power walls are for deep cycling and long term storage with a slower more constant draw."
"Tesla controls the Powerwall's firmware directly and they do it so they can maximize battery longevity.

This is the reason Tesla warrants the system for 10 years if you have them connected to the internet and 4 or so years if you completely lock Tesla out."
Why would you not charge the car to 100%?
"It was about $42k total not including the ~ $12k tax credit. Our monthly payments are $113, but lower with any additional payments we make. Basically our monthly cost will go down yearly because we pay slightly more than the minimum, while everyone else’s electric rates will most likely rise yearly. We were used to our PG&E bills ranging anywhere from $80 - $500+ so this has really added a massive layer of financial stability to our expenses. 

In just the last 30 days our home has consumed 480 kWh of energy. The panels have produced 876 kWh total since the 3rd, we took 118 kWh from PG&E the few days before and after activation while the Powerwalls charged up, have sent 450 kWh back to the grid, and the Powerwalls have received 249 kWh from the panels while providing 185 kWh  of that to the house (99% of this when the sun doesn’t shine).

Hopefully that wasn’t too confusing; I was having a hard time figuring out how to present that information."
"I will say TRUST Tesla’s estimate of how much solar & storage you will need. When I first saw the kWh for each I thought now way we would need that much, but it has been the perfect mix!"
"Having a UPS for your whole house is also very nice. Having your heater motherboard fry for instance can be expensive. Not talking about PCs and other electrical equipment. Yes, you could buy smaller UPSs for each individually but still. This is another way. Also, it depends if you can benefit from incentives for Solar/storage."
"I think the Powerwalls have a 10 year warranty so that doesn’t necessarily work. But if you have like a 15-30 year warranty covering production on your panels it could work that way. I think part of it comes down to just how much degradation occurs to the power wall over a long period of time. If they hold up to 75% capacity over 30 years and can still power your whole house then you’re definitely going to come out ahead. It’s hard to say though cuz they haven’t existed as a product for that long.
 I think your assumption is correct for most people though."
"I’m in the same boat. My electric company has a website that lets you estimate your savings with solar. No matter what I do, I can never get back to even. I’d love to have battery backup just in case the grid goes down but I have higher priority things to spend my money on."
This is awesome..
"Well we have motion activated lighting & when the neighbors went out to see if it was their home or the entire neighborhood having issues, they activated our lights. They came over to ask out of curiosity. Our entire community has a private FB group and we have monthly get togethers at different homes on the street so we are pretty close."
Haha that sounded strange to me too! Half of my neighborhood has whole-house generators so having power during a blackout isn’t unusual where I live.
"IIRC, you can keep them running, but only if you have to have some extra gear that isolates your home from the grid in case of an outage, so that line workers can safely work on damaged cables."
"You can plug in your information on Tesla’s website and they’ll give you an idea of what you need and at what cost. 
I’m pretty sure they’ll work with non-Tesla panels, the answer should be on their site though. 
Check out [Project Sunroof](https://www.google.com/get/sunroof) to get an estimate on how much your panels produce a year."
Literally everything the tesla power wall website could probably answer for you. Don’t be a skrimp.
"It’s completely worth it though. No down payment and a stable monthly bill that is much lower than what we’d pay without. Over the life of the panels, I would be paying much more to the utility than for the system itself. I honestly highly suggest getting a free inspection from them if you haven’t already. It may be way more affordable than you think. They take your utility bill and historic data into consideration as well."
"Yeah, apparently this one will last about 48 hours, but we aren’t going to be affected by it at all! What a time to be alive."
This is awesome
This is true. I was playing Red Dead Redemption 2 & didn’t notice the outage until about 8 minutes later when a neighbor came knocking.
"Haha, I was imagining the same thing."
I noticed that too! I wonder if that only shows up during an outage.
"No, it only shows it during an outage. The original image with the house, panel, and battery is completely replaced by this image."
In some regions your electric company won't allow this kind of setup. Ymmv
Reach out to Tesla and see if they can come out and do a free inspection and quote. You can have all the info in hand and it may be much more worth it / affordable than you imagine.
Yes. Some ppl charge it via grid at night and use it at day
Yep!
How big of system did you get?
"Honestly, I think Powerwall is what truly makes it worth it. If I had to choose between a larger system with no Powerwall and a smaller system with at least 1, I would have chosen the latter. In the end, as long as your paying less for the system overall than what you’d pay to the utility, it is already worth it. Beyond worth it for us."
"Not too sure, with our set up we never come close to getting under 50% and once the sun is up, they are charged up once again."
You can store energy from the grid or from solar panels.
use the car battery? haha that would be cool
"Yeah, but much more reliable to have a dedicated system for your home I think. I would hate to be stuck in a situation where my husband has the car & the power is out while I’m at home in the summer or winter."
I feel you. Stopped renting late last year and it feels liberating.
"Power the home completely. I way drying a blanket, playing Red Dead Redemption 2 on a PS4 Pro & 4K tv, AC was on, and some miscellaneous lighting around the house. 

My home must have seemed like a beacon within the pitch black neighborhood."
Dude was playing video games... what do you skrimp?
You may want to call Tesla on that. The frequency regulation should be much better than that.
"I don’t know what those are so I’m assuming we don’t have them. Also, no beeping coming from anywhere so probably not."
"I got a PM from someone with a link to a posted solution to my problem. You can ask Tesla to change the powerwall to switch to 62.5 Hz during a daylight outage.

https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/my-grid-outage-frequency-issue-is-resolved.155552/"
What size system and can I ask how much you paid?
"I have solar + PowerWall and live in Florida.

If you have Solar only and the grid goes dark, then yes, the solar must turn ire because the system may send excess power to the grid.

Tesla’s PowerWall and gateway system acts as an intermediary.  If the grid goes dark, the system knows and will not interact further with the grid until it knows it’s been restored for at least 5-minutes.  Here your solar and/or PowerWall can operate independent of the grid."
"Partially true 
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/is-it-illegal-florida-power-home-solar-storm/"
"I'm in FL too. If your gear is UL listed for islanding, you can still power loads from solar during a grid outage, assuming you have batteries or one of the newer inverters that will regulate production via frequency shifting (outback skybox, for example)"
"Yes. Their main function is to provide power during an outage, at night, or when the sun doesn’t shine."
"Solar does work in a grid down situation. Albeit it does so by constantly recharging the Powerwall in the daytime until the grid is restored.

The reason it is not fully active during an outage is because there is no grid for all the excess the energy to flow back to in the first place, therefore the system automatically reduces panel production accordingly. 

You can see in the graph how solar worked in sync with Powerwall to maintain the entire home during the 6 hour outage. 

[Tesla Energy Outage Graph](https://imgur.com/gallery/xLXMp0c)"
Would you please explain how one of these 'inverter' thingamajigs can keep the lights on during a power cut?
What?
"I'm assuming you are referring to the title and the confused neighbors. The title also said it's pitch black outside. While the neighbors are probably aware of his solar panels on the roof, powerwall batteries were probably the core concept his neighbors we're missing, not inverters. 

""If it's dark then how are you getting power?"" is probably the question they asked. I don't think the average citizen would question how you convert ~18v DC to 120v AC but they probably wouldn't care if they see it working. The magic black box is certainly doing its job."
powerall cost?  did you look at lead acid as a compare?
"Can you please talk a bit more about your solar system details? How many panels, what size, controller, etc?
Thanks!"
if it only goes down to 75% then couldn’t you have just bought 1 powerwall?
"Sgt Maj, please don’t make me mow grass."
So 6.6kW panels with 27kWh battery? That's quite disproportionate but seems to be working well for you - are you in a place where sunlight is strong? Like well over 1000kWh/m² per year?
Does that mean that you never really draw power from the grid?
My car alone uses like 20kwh a day... how are you surviving on 24kwh for your house?! I use (including car) ~70kwh a day!
"How do you use so little power?

I use at least 30kWh per day in winter! During summer with air cons running I use upwards of 50kWh. This is a 3 adult household. I haven't taken delivery of my Model 3 yet, so those figures don't include car energy usage.

My powerwall can go from 100% to completely flat in as little as 4 hours some evenings in summer!"
do you worry now that your neighbors know you have running a/c if the power ever goes out again?  that they may try to impose on you?
"Jezzzez!!

I live in Norway in a house from 1989. About 250 sq meters (2690 sq f). 

Last year we used 32770 kwh!
And about a ton of coal (yes I know, but the oven was there when we bought the house, and I got the coal for free). 

We currently have a heatwave (as most of europe). No AC. So we are averaging about 40 kwh. Just to run the house (basically water boilers, coffe, computers and tv). 
120kwh a day if I charge the tesla. 

So far this month: 1204 kwh
Average since we moved in here in february 2017: 2269 kwh. 

I have ordered a powerwall, but they are not available in Norway yet. But a bit of solar and a powerwall will hopefully make a dent in the powerbill :-)


[screendump with consumption](https://imgur.com/gallery/V1zyrVG)"
"do you leave the AC on all the time? or set back when you leave the home? are all 4 people home during the day, or mostly empty? 

like /u/Lancaster61 mentions, I use way more than 24kwh - and that's before the car. 1900sqft house, built in the 60s."
"Damn, I live in a 270 sq.ft (25 m²) apartement alone, don't have a car to power with electricity and still managed to peak at 24 kWh/day a few times this year. But then again that was in January and 70% was probably from heating"
You must have a really efficient A/C. Our house is 46.3 kWh average usage and our system pumps out 43 kWh on average per day. I drive 75 miles a day in my M3P+ and charge it every third day. I know our A/C is struggling this summer so we need to look to replace it with one that is more properly sized for our 2600 sq ft home. The days when we send the most power back to the grid is when my wife and kid are not home during the day but with it being summer vacation they are home soaking up the A/C.
"What? You're using 14W/sqft?!  My house uses 36W/sqft. Granted I use 4W/sqft for car charging, and it's a two story in 110F, but that's a really low usage."
My house is 2200 ft.² and we use about 80 kWh. Sounds like we have the same conditions too. What the hell.
"Still trying to figure out if it’s worth it for our house in TX. 

Gas heat, gas dryer, gas stove, gas hot water heater. Just AC is electric. 

Plus, Texas heat basically means the AC runs for 24 hours a day sometimes. 

Plus, Texas and hail go hand in hand, so roof replacements are common.  I assume having panels on the roof will make it more expensive to replace if a hail storm rips through."
Are you waiting for solar tiles instead of panels?
Yes & yes! I can play Red Dead Redemption 2 without even realizing there is an outage!
It also uses the the 3g Telstra network if Wi-Fi drops.
"I actually sell and supply Solar PV systems and Powerwall 2's with a company called Supergreen Solutions in Townsville (we're doing several hundred at Harris Crossing).  

I did my system in increments expanding from a 5kw to 13.2kw across two phases before adding the battery.  All up I guess it cost about $24k (If you look at my post history you will see a more detailed explanation about costing). To give you an indication though Powerwall 2 with backup gateway supplied and installed with a 6.6kw solar PV array is about $19.5k provided no Ergon upgrades to the meterbox are needed and you're low set with a colorbond roof."
It's not often you see Australia and Puerto Rico in the same sentence.
Care to elaborate?
Could be that the definition of 100% changes slightly every charge. Pretty sure this is what phones do. Avoiding true 100% battery wear but still reporting as 100% to avoid confusing users.
"Good to know, thanks!"
"The main reason is that Lithium Ion batteries degrade faster when you charge above 90% or deplete below 10% too often.

Another reason is that there is limited to no regenerative braking possible above 90%. So you are more likely to waste energy by having to use friction brakes. This is because batteries can only trickle charge as they get close to full and cannot accept high bursts of power to recharge."
Thanks man. I've always dreamed of being off the grid. Especially with an electric car in my garage. Be good and enjoy them.
Do you get anything for sending power back to the grid?
Does the power wall graph show you usage back to when you activated it? Screenshot that.
[deleted]
"Yeah but who stays in their house for 30 years :) I’m in my early 30s and have already bought and sold 4 different properties.  Will probably sell this one that I just bought in 4-5 years.   It would make More sense at my “retirement” home. But that’s another 20 years off or so.  It’s good to pass along to new buyers, but it you lose that money for the solar and power wall for the most part. Unless you transfer the power wall and have it installed at the new place.  Not sure if the power wall falls under the “must convey” items of a house."
Sounds strange to me that anyone would have a generator at all! Haha
What you're referring to is a Powerwall gateway.  There are two versions.  The most recent is the gateway 2.0 which provides polyphase support but backup on a single phase.
"Yes, I’ve heard about this issue (the “safety” I was referring to) but I thought that in the US they would have the same problem, too... I mean: I would expect that in case of power outage the workers won’t be carbonized by the random citizen with a powerwall hahah

My electrician told me that the problem with using the powerwall as a UPS is that they are simply not compliant with a very old law, although the could work without issues. It’s just a matter of regulation.

I’ve never looked deeper than this, but I hope that future this gets fixed... it feels stupid!"
"Thanks for the link unfortunately it doesn’t cover the area we are closing on! 

I have compared some places close by and it says it would take 10 years to make my initial investment back. 

What’s the best way to approximate the solar panel cost and I have read the powerwall FAQ and as I understand I would have to purchase the powerwall with solar panel to get a tax break i.e if I have an existing solar panel installing powerwall on this setup doesn’t give any tax break ?

And also SGIP credit was a bit tricky to understand.

I am on mobile will try to re-read on the web."
Don’t have my own house yet nor do I know the electric bill so it may be worth it I just am dreaming lol
"Haha, thanks. 👍 
It wasn't a bad hour and a half considering."
Yeah those powerwalls are super cool! Glad yours is working like a champ!
"Yep, it will fall to you to hold up civilization as we know it ..."
"Not in this view, but there is a place where you can view the percentage"
Ah bummer.  Pretty much the only reason I leave the Power Flow screen is to see the PW %.  I hope they add it to the non-outage screen.
"I would, but I don't plan on staying here very long. 

In a few years I'll decide"
6.615 kW.
I think if I had added the Powerwall I would have been over my monthly payment.
"Yes, it is a battery for your entire home. It’s awesome! The power has been out again for the last 5 hours and I didn’t notice a thing until I started taking some screenshots for people. The panels and Powerwalls work perfectly together during an outage. 

[Tesla Solar + Powerwall During Outage](https://imgur.com/gallery/rE5Buoy) 

[Tesla Home Energy Screenshots](https://imgur.com/gallery/UpLnpt8)"
Yeah it’s called vehicle to grid (V2G) and I believe the first Roadster could do it. But no longer. I’m sure they want to avoid undue wear on the battery but I’m sure they can figure out a way to use it just for blackouts.
">My home must have seemed like a beacon within the pitch black neighborhood.

""Bow before me peasants see I have electricity and you don't have any"""
"Idk, maybe he has things like heating/cooling placed so the wall doesn't power it"
From everything I've found about it this is the expected behavior. It generates 65Hz to disable the inverters until the batteries drain enough to accept more power. One battery charge level is low enough to switches back to 60Hz. APC and CyberPower UPSes will only accept between 57-63Hz.
"7.5kW since it's just me and my wife, but we did a 15 year loan for around 23k. The micro inverter is good for 25 year warranty and my average monthly bill was around 122 bucks a month. My bill is now 126 and since I generate at around 102% efficiency I shouldn't see another real electric bill other than the 8ish dollars for being connected to the grid.

I got a quote from Tesla for 2 sets of panels for around 21k without the powerwalls. My state does net metering so I don't really have a need for a battery."
Ok thats good to know. Lots of conflicting info out there about Florida and solar.
"Yes, the power outage is still going on and the panels and Powerwalls are working in sync. As soon as the batteries drop a few % points, the panels activate to charge them back up and keep us at a safe level. 

[Tesla App Graph During Power Outage](https://imgur.com/gallery/rE5Buoy)"
Isn’t there anti-islanding equipment available that does prevent energy from flowing back in a grid down situation?
"Inverters take 12v/24v from a source like a car battery and using transformers up it to 120/240V ac to power ac appliences. This is hard on the battery with multi-kw loads so ""leisure"" batteries are often used as they can be discharged more and at a faster rate than traditional car batteries"
They do what Tesla powerwall does.  Store power with a battery but cheaply.
"$7600 for one powerwall, plus installation"
"Lead acids die way too fast, you'll end up spending more money and time on them."
"I don't think there's any lead acid alternatives available for commercial usage. Lead acid gets nowhere near as many charge cycles as lithium-ion, plus when you buy from Tesla you get warranty and good app integration. 

Even if you could get half the cost per KWh in lead acid I still don't think it would be smart to get lead acid batteries."
Check on Tesla's website.
I don’t know much else on the technical side other than the above. Sorry!
"We could have, but wanted to ensure we could run 24/7 if we were having to charge our vehicle all night. Yesterday’s nightly outage lasted 3 hours and 12 minutes and apparently it has been down again this morning since about 4 hours ago. I woke up about an hour ago to a fully charged car, a cool home, and didn’t even notice the outage until I went into the app for screenshots lol. 

[Tesla Home Energy Screenshots](https://imgur.com/gallery/UpLnpt8)"
"Well, you shouldn’t have looked at it when you walked passed it. The SgtMaj sees you, especially when they’re not visible to you. Now take these nail clippers and get to gettin."
Drop with it and start pushing. Lol
"Yes, they should have even more battery capacity.   6.6kw panels will generate 52.8kw in 8 hours and they'll only be able to store half of that!  In reality though you can't judge proportions from just these 2 numbers like this.  Instead factors like when they charge an ev (does it charge during the day or is it at work, so it charges during the night?) and how many people are home during the day vs during the night all factor into how big your batteries should be."
"I’m in the CA Central Valley, Fresno specifically. Incredibly sunny most of the year and very hot summers / cold winters."
We never draw power from the grid. Not since it was turned on about 24 days ago.
"Not OP.

But for comparison, we use an average of 30 KWh/day for our house and Model S combined."
"Most days our home usage is under 15kWh/day, the extreme heat has changed that this week though. My commute is only a few miles per day so I typically only charge a few hours at home. Usually in the afternoon when most of our energy is going back into the grid, after the Powerwalls have finished charging."
I use about 12-15kWh a day and live in the UK even with my (PH)EV charging every night for a 12 mile commute.    But no air conditioning probably helps that.
Can you give us house size location etc. Isnt 50kwh excessive
"I had a 3,000 sqf home with two AC’s and charged a volt and an i3. We used 3,700 kWh a month during the summer and between 1,600-2,100 in the winter. That was in Florida. I’m in the UK now using a fraction of that; no AC."
"No car here but I use 2.5 to 3 a day here. 
I have no idea how you could use 20 a day. Let alone 50!"
Do you use a regular wall outlet or do you have an EV charging system at home?
24kwh per day is about right for a 4 person home. How many KMs do you drive a day?
[deleted]
"An average house can run around 1kw (1000 watts) of power.  Take all of the electrical needs (lights, appliances, TV, AC, etc...) in the early evening and add them up (or look at your electric meter). Then consider when it is night or no-one is home (no TV, stove, lights, less AC)."
"Could you elaborate some more on your living arrangements? This seems highly unlikely, you’d have to have a serious McMansion with multiple ac units,  heated pool(s), absolutely no insulation (no windows actually), coupled with a few other quite unusual appliances (massive water fountains?) to even come close to that kind of power usage for a single family home. 

Alternatively:
A)your son might not really be interested in botanics, he’s growing weed - big time. 
B) Your friendly neighbor is tapping your power. - to grow weed."
Right?? I always wonder that. I'm using like 80kwh per day in summer. Even with us gone the past week and HVAC not even running (nest says it's 84 frigging degrees in the house at 9am right now) the house is using 21kwh/day. I think that's from my model s sitting in the sun plugged in and ac kicking on non-stop.
"Are you running a server farm in your house?? That's a crap ton of usage.

I avg around 16-18kwh per day in a 3000 sq ft house with two adults. Probably 20-24kwh if it's really hot out."
I have no idea how you’re using so much energy because that is incredibly high. I just checked and the house only used 11.1 kWh total yesterday. It’s fluctuated between 24 kWh and 7.9 kWh over the last 7 days for a 94.8 kWh total for the entire week.
What size system do you have?
"I have a feeling many of these people claiming extremely low usage don't have a 100% electric house, and those claiming higher do.

I have a geothermal heat pump, heat pump water heater, 1 person house with a plug-in car I drive only lightly, and I'm still 25-35 kWh here in summer (sometimes as low as 23, but been almost 40 on hot day with driving & laundry)."
G
"I don’t because we are friends with all of our neighbors. If they ever need to come over, then we can all just hangout. Being from the 90’s, our home has smaller bedrooms and average sized kitchen, but 2 very large living rooms and dining room."
"Wow that’s insane. We (m31,f31 and a 3 month old baby) live in a house and spend 1900 kwh per year. I can charge the car at work so that’s not included but your monthly average just looks really really high.

I live in the Netherlands"
"Well, where I am from everybody has boilers, coffes, tvs and average 3 to 10 kWh a day. How do you average 40 without running AC.. Are you running a restaurant 24/7 or something? :D"
"Is solar worth it as far north as Norway? No AC, so you'll get gluts of power in the summer when you don't need it and not enough to heat the place in the winter."
We have a Nest that uses our location to automatically pre-heat/cool the home before we arrive and turn off automatically when no one is present. 1 person is home throughout the night / morning and then rest throughout the evening / night.
We have the original AC that came with the home from the 90’s so I’m not sure if it is an energy efficient one. Luckily it hasn’t broken down yet for us to find out.
"After waking up to all of these comments, I have no idea how people are using so much energy in their homes. I feel like we are pretty normal with our usage, but maybe not. We are the type of people that don’t turn anything on until we are actively using it and turn it off immediately after so I’m going to assume maybe it’s that. It doesn’t seem like much, but a person here or there turning multiple things on that aren’t being actively used, lights, etc might add up quickly over a monthly period."
"Sounds like something is not right or not being noticed at home lol. 

Below is our usage for comparison. 

[Tesla Home Energy Usage](https://imgur.com/gallery/UpLnpt8)"
Oh shit I just moved to Texas and plan on someday buying a house and solar panels. Hmmmm
[deleted]
Be careful when someone sells them to you as a very important aspect gets overlooked. Your ac unit has a nameplate rating called LRA. This the number of amps drawn when they turn on. Because your home uses alot of gas you may not need as many batteries but if you have a large ac unit and I've seen normal ones that have LRA units as high as 152A. Basically a single powerwall can output 29.1A max for about ten seconds. If they sense higher they will power off and need to be cycled manually. This is important in a backup mode and at night with no solar. Keep that in mind when someone goes to sell you one.
"Someone else can correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe they offer a roof warranty as well as their system warranty. I would check it out"
"Hail and Texas go hand in hand. Hi, i sell roofs and work with my dad in his roofing company. You want to keep your insurance policy and notify them when you install solar. We're paid to remove and replace these things all the time and guess what? They can take a beating. Never seen one with a scratch on them. People are nuts about these things breaking and they rarely do."
"Have them come out for a free inspection and quote. You have nothing to lose and could get a lot of really good info. It just may be much more worth it than you thought. It has been completely worth it for us. Plus you get warranty and if you have insurance, it should be good."
I'm in Texas and don't have time of use options so it wasn't worth it for us to add batteries to our system. Got 12.5kw solar install and it's offset about 85% of our electricity use.
I already have panels. I got an email to redeem my referral powerwall in September 2017. Still waiting for it.
"Thanks for that, will look more into it!"
"That is absolutely a possibility. It would be nice to know if that is so. Kind of like when the car gets down to 0%, but really still has a bit of a cushion of mileage left."
[deleted]
"Regarding the braking, what happens when you override the limit and charge to 100% like when you're going on a trip?  Are the driving characteristics different because of this?"
"Yes, at the end of the year PG&E will tally up all of your total usage and total production. If you used more than you produced, then you would have paid it during your normal billing cycle, if you produced more, you will receive a credit or check back in the mail depending on what you choose. I believe the amount they pay you per kWh is very low, but still way better than paying out and also not receiving anything back at all. The below link to their site should be able to explain this better than I. 

[Surplus Energy Credit](https://www.pge.com/en_US/residential/solar-and-vehicles/green-energy-incentives/getting-credit-for-surplus-energy/getting-credit-for-surplus-energy.page)"
"I would assume PG&E doesn’t give you a cent for the power you are giving them.  In return, they sell it to someone else and make money off your solar panels.  Purely a guess.  

Would it be possible to have the system “disconnect” once the batteries hit 100%.  That way your not giving your electric company free power?"
"It was a Monday when I called to inquire, Tuesday for the initial inspection, and all documentation necessary was signed by Thursday, with the system fully installed the following Monday & Tuesday."
"I’d talk to a realtor, I imagine it’d add a lot of value to a house if you sell down the line. Especially if the warranty is active when you sell it."
"Unfortunately, I do not know the answers to these questions. You might get more information from actual owners if you post in the daily discussion thread or just a post in the sub.  Best of luck!"
"For me it was simple. If my monthly cost of the system for the year was going to be less than the historical payments to the utility for the year, totally worth it."
"I need a 6.5 Kw but Tesla is telling me either 4 KW or 8KW, kind of annoying."
That is so awesome

WUT?
"I’m not following. 

When the grid is down, there is nowhere for the excess energy to flow back to. This is why the system adjusts the panel output & battery charge accordingly. 

Maybe I am not understanding the question."
does that include solar panels and stuff? like is this an all in one system?
"This is correct.  While lead acid may be cheaper upfront, you will replace every 3-5 years"
"As someone helping get a 10kwh lead acid battery replaced with lithium, I agree.

Off grid property, the 24v 10kwh lead acid needs to be fed distilled water regularily and currently holding about 2kwh of capacity. It's quite screwed... and it's too large and heavy to be removed without heavy machinery."
Lead acid has been used for backup power for years https://www.solarreviews.com/blog/are-li-ion-or-lead-acid-batteries-better-for-home-energy-storage
"thanks, I asked solar city  tesla about it years ago but pricing was vague and very high

this looks pretty good avtually"
No problem!  😊
"hmm i see. but on a serious question though, how often do you get these outages and is that really worth the extra $8000? i mean you could have had half as long of an outage as your neighbor and just kinda sit in the dark for an hour if it really drained your entire power wall. the next day would have charged your power wall again back like normal when the sun comes up"
They don't need any more batteries for everyday use. They're still at 25% when their recharge cycle starts.
"Usage can definitely greatly vary. I took some screenshots of the last day, week, month if this helps. 

[Tesla Home Energy Screenshots](https://imgur.com/gallery/UpLnpt8)"
That really impressive. Where abouts in the world do you live if you don’t mind me asking? I assume you get a lot of sunshine
Does your grid allow you to push power back and get credit?
Do you have the option of limiting max SOC for the powerwalls?  Similar to the SOC limiter in the vehicle?
"When I found out the powerwalls were only 13.5kwh I was disappointed (edit: qualifying this further, for the price/size I was expecting a bigger battery). I feel like they should be 50kwh. I could see the 13.5kwh being cycled a lot and last way less than you would expect :-\  
  
Further edit: 
I know they are scalable. price/size of the unit for the battery storage were both of my concerns, or rather what caused my surprise when I found out they were only 13.5kwh. My reference frame was their car packs. Model 3 LR module volume is 2717 and 2938 in^3 , so total around 11310 in^3  while the powerwall 2 is 8207 in^3 (I wasn't able to find the S/X pack dimensions, and yes I know the 3 is more advanced/higher density). I just expected more, and didn't think the circuitry would have taken up such a significant portion of the powerwall (considering the powerwall is not the only component that needs to be installed)."
"That’s awesome I haven’t even bought a Tesla yet and out usage this summer is freakin 50kwh per day. This heat is killing us, only a 1,250 square footage house to."
Sounds like you can charge the car any time of the day and not worry about the state of the power wall. More houses need to be setup like yours.
"Your house must be very tightly sealed and well insulated. You say it's about 1700 sq ft and built in the 90s.

By comparison I have a similar size house made in 1972 and 2 EVs my average usage for the last 12 months is 37.85 kwh per day. My lowest usage month was November 2018 when I averaged 23.16 kWh a day using little to no heat or air conditioning.

If I had 2 powerwalls and the grid power was down I wouldn't be charging the EVs at home and likely wouldn't be using much heat or AC. I'd be able to live off of 17 kwh a day but I'd have to off load car charging to a public EVSE and keep the HVAC from running hard."
How is this possible?
"How long have you had your powerwall? Interested in it, don’t know anyone with solar panels let alone Tesla, well not in the U.K."
"I live in Australia.  During summer our consumption sometimes is as high as 60kwh per day due to having to run aircon. My 13kw array generates around 75kwh and the Powerwall stores 13.5 for nighttime use, though on those days we generally deplete the battery by 10pm. I am going to buy a second PW though which will see us through. 

We're getting a Model 3 which is going to add to our consumption though."
"2000sqft, 100 degree weather often, 2 stories."
"I'm in the same ball park of usage. ~6,000 Sq. Ft, 5 humans, Virginia.

Low of mid 30s kWh in the spring to mid 60s last month."
"Well, you used in one month what an average european uses in 2 years :o"
"Living alone in an apartment (~60 m²), I average ~5 kWh/day over the year. No AC and no electric heating, but various tech stuff that's on a lot of time. Car not included, don't have home charging ATM.

I can imagine that with a family-sized house with electric heating and AC you could easily go far into double digits."
On a hot day in North Qld we can go through 60. We have a two storey 4 bedroom with a theatre and large upstairs living area.  We run 6 splits at 24C in summer. The house is fully insulated and LED throughout.  It's just stupidly hot up here in Summer.
"IIRC,Nissan were trialling V2H systems a few years back..(Using the car battery as storage/supply) It was estimated a typical Japanese home could use maybe 7kW in a day..figures for (Larger) American homes were estimated in double figures.."
"The lowest energy using state is Hawaii and they average 15kwh per day. 

You're so far below what I'd consider an extreme outlier, I question if you live in a tent with a kerosene lamp as your primary light source"
3kwh will give you like 12 miles of driving range lol... this doesn’t even including AC or phantom drain.
I have the Tesla wall charger.
I don’t know but I know I use about 20% battery a day on my Model 3. Sometimes more.
"2000sqft home, 100F weather, AC at 74F, Tesla uses ~20% of battery a day, and other normal house stuff..."
I run about 1 kwh normally all the time. Getting better monitoring to help control more vampires :)
"No it’s just me and a roommate lol. My car alone uses 20%+ range a day which equates to about 10-20kwh alone. Then 2000sqft house, 100F weather kept at 74F, and the rest are normal house appliances every other home has.

I do have an electric water heater though."
"Nope.

I should have mentioned I have a pool and my house is 330 sq m."
That'd be a little above average in North Queensland.  I work in the industry and have seen quarterly bills as high as $2500 with usage well above 100kwh per day.
"8kW of panels and 8.2kW inverter.

I generate a maximum of 30kWh per day in June and 50kWh per day in December."
The only non electric item in our home is the water boiler so not sure why our usage is so low ranging between 24.4 kWh to 7.9 kWh the last 7 days.
"that's good to hear.  i hope you start a trend of panels + PW installs with them, you would hope that some of them are capable of learning from a firsthand object lesson"
"Hahaha :-)
I wish!"
"That is preaty much the situation. But I have just installed 1,2 kw of panels. The plan is to run them for a few years to get decent production data. Based on that, I can consider mounting up to 33 panels on the south facing roof. 

The system is not operational yet but I have tested it. And on a really good day, I can get up to 11 or 12 kwh. 

But there are a lot of solar installations popping up around. Due to low temperatures, the efficiency of the panes are invreased. So they say that solar in my area (stavanger) is comparable to northern germany :-)

So I need to have my panels working for a few years to have decent data to make a decission based on. Especially winter..."
I’m salivating over those screenshots. Awaiting install of my solar/PW system. Sounds like I need to clean out the AC ducts or something.
"For me, I’m going to wait until they have the solar “roof” going. 

If a tornado rips the roof off my house, I would assume insurance would replace the solar panels since they are, essentially, the roof. 

Additionally, from what Elon has said, these solar roofs will hold up much better to storms than the usual shingles."
It’s the same way in the southeast too. 95-100F every day isn’t easy on an AC unit
"It's true.  What makes it the worst is when the nights only dip to 80 degrees.  I'm in North Texas and we've certainly had a mild year this year.

My solar plan will likely involve net metering and enough solar to get me through my lowest use month.  So I'll still have a bill, just a smaller one."
Good info thanks for the details!
Oh darn. Well I wish you the best of luck and hope you get them before the end of the year.
The powerwall has an extra 4.5% capacity that it keeps in reserve. Assume it adds this in over time to stay inside warranty limits. You can see it if you  log into its direct WiFi interface. SOC will be higher than in the mobile App by about 4.5%
"That isnt true at all. Samsung for sure does it, thats how they maintain their 95%+ battery life after 2 years claim, they literally have a bigger battery that they only charge to say 70%, and cycle between the cells to prevent degradation. Tesla does the exact same thing in their vehicles, hence how they magically were able to offer another 20% range during hurricanes."
"If I'm not mistaken phones charge to 100%, then stop charging and let the battery drain to 90%, then charges back to 100% and repeat for however long the phone is plugged in. All while reporting 100% charge."
You couldn't be wrong-er
"Yes, at 100% charge the car will just coast like an ICE car. Only the friction brakes will slow you down."
"Yes, on a Tesla, when you charge to 100%, it alerts you that regenerative braking is limited. When you let off the accelerator, whereas you usually get slowed down by regen, you will instead ""coast"". This means you'll be applying the friction brakes more to stop or slow down."
"Yes, it takes a few stops to get used to it. It's almost like driving an antique ICE car (only in the no regenerative breaking sense) for a few miles until you give yourself some space. Fortunately it warms you, and it gradually comes back so you start getting some low end braking fairly quickly. It just takes awhile to get full breaking at higher speeds."
"That's only be a concern if you live at the top of a long mountain road with 100% battery-- it'll have to slow down with the friction brakes instead of regen.   

The solution would be to set the max charge to something like 70% before heading down.   At the bottom of the mountain you'll have more charge then what you started out with."
"i hope that doesn't work that way there...

Here in the netherlands you get(with most cable companies) 50% of the Kwh price if you deliver. they are planning on making this number variable, so that when there is a lot of power consumption you only get 25% back, but when there is no wind, and night, you get 75%."
"If you don’t know and admit that you are assuming and guessing, then why even bother to add your thoughts and ask skrimpy questions like this ?"
They pay you wholesale prices at the end of your true-up period.
"Even if this was true, why would you ever do that? If they PG&E needs the power, they’ll ramp up gas powerplants, they don’t have solar laying around.

Purely a guess? Why bother
"Thanks for the reply, can you elaborate on the comment 
> monthly cost of the system for the year less than historical payments to the utility for the year 

Are you in a financing plan with Tesla which makes your monthly payment less than the average monthly electricity bill ?

I am looking at the new homes and the advertised energy efficiency by the builder says ~ 100-150$ in the electricity bill costs hence have to do the math right to see if the powerwall makes sense in our case.

Edit: Also if you don’t mind answering the below qs.

1. What’s the avg monthly electricity bill with & without the installation ?

2. Did you do solar panel also with tesla or just the powerwall ?"
Is this a scenario where “go big or go home” would not be appropriate?
"I believe it was announced a few weeks ago that they would only be selling configurations by 4’s. So 4, 8, 12 kWh, etc. Probably to streamline things at their solar factory."
Did the batteries last through the outage?
"It is my understanding that in MOST ""grid tied"" setups, your solar is literally cut off 100% when the grid goes down.  Maybe this is a misconception of mine... but I've definitely seen it reiterated a lot.  The reason given by the power companies for this is because they claim they don't want their electricians getting electrocuted by personal power plants.  Now I'm not 100% clear on how this would happen anyways since grid tied systems need a sinusoid to ""follow"", and without that sinusoid i'm not sure how an individual's solar setup would inject power back into the grid... anyways, thats neither here nor there.

My question is, if we have [anti-islanding technology](https://www.siliconsolar.com/what-is-anti-islanding-protection/) already... why can't we just build systems that divert all power to the house (or battery) when the grid is down.  Non of this ""shut off"" BS.  There are people who have shit tons of solar on their house, but still lose power at noon if the grid goes down.  Now my conspiracy theory is that power companies know that if this gets popular.... some people will by accident figure out that ""Hey... I probably don't need to pay for grid power at all"", then the leap to idea people can simply have their own power source because less of a leap and more of a logical next step."
"That's just the powerwall. Check out [Tesla's site](https://www.tesla.com/energy/design/#solarpanels)

Although it looks like they offer $1000 off if you buy solar+powerwall at the same time"
Lith ion is x6 the energy density compared to lead too.
"It's worth looking at the videos from HighTechLab on YouTube and his conversion from Lead Acid:
https://youtu.be/crymc4avun4"
You can get sealed units that are maintenance free.
Ehh our Server UPS batteries need replaced about every 2 years. The ROI on home use would suck.
"I lived in a house that had lead acid battery backup and it was a nightmare, the cells kept dieing on us."
"I think the biggest advantage for Tesla is the gateway, allowing my whole house to be backed up instantly if the grid goes down. Most other systems I see normally are around backing up a limited number of devices.
Lead acid could be more suited for off grid and you don't mind the constant maintenance."
"$8000 would also get you in the ballpark of a generator that would keep you running for days or longer.  If you have access to NG or LPG, that’s still the “better” way to go for backup power but definitely not as cool.  If you are going solar anyway especially..."
It was sarcastic as evident by the contrary statement that followed it.
"OP said their electric company is PG&E so probably California.

Edit: So the votes say I'm correct, but holy crap 77 votes just to name an electric company? Seems like a strange bandwagon but alrighty then."
"Fresno, California

"Nope, no option or controls. I believe someone else in the comments pointed out that there is something different about these batteries and the vehicle batteries."
"I wonder if there are design limitation differences that influence this. Could be operating temperature ranges, maximum draw/charge rates, safety considerations (fire risk, etc.), and more. And even just weight of the item for installation/transportation/etc."
"Literally you could buy a brand new base model 3, pull the battery and throw away the car, and come out way ahead of a powerwall installation on a per kwh basis."
Are you a bit dim?
"Wow, is most of that from a/c!? How old is your a/c unit?"
"Solar panels make electricty during the day. They first charge Tesla branded batteries in his basement or wherever. Once those batteries are full then the solar panel excess either goes back to the utility company or to fill up his electric car. The solar also powers his air conditioning and everything else in the house. When the sun goes down the batteries take over powering everything in the house and he isn't using electricty generated anywhere else other than his roof.

Sounds like OP probably has more solar than he needs and by a lot. Time to start mining some Bitcoin."
How is what possible?

"I have a ChargePoint in the garage, just haven’t had it installed yet. We went with CP since we wanted to future proof our home for all EV’s Incase anything else becomes viable or friends / family come over with non-Tesla’s."
"In addition to being bigger, it's possible your home is leakier and less insulated, meaning you are spending a lot more energy cooling it."
"Do you keep it at 74 all the time, even when at work? Why would you keep the whole house cool, when you’re only in one room at a time? I’m not American and actually work in the energy sector and that usage sounds insane.  Don’t mean to be insulting at all, just seriously puzzled why."
"Look into replacing your pool pump with a more efficient one, those suckers do suck a lot of power."
"I'm in southern Ontario, Canada. TIL I guess. Solar and Powerwalls would have such a short payback period for you in AUS. Definitely not the case up here."
"I think water heater is maybe 2nd biggest consumer of electricity outside heating and cooling the home, for most people (3rd for electric car).

Other reasonably large ticket items include:

 * Fridge
 * Basement dehumidifiers (I have one)
 * clothes dryer (people who use clothes lines can save a lot)

I think my baseload is around ~~3.3-4 kW~~ 330-400 watts, and quite a bit of that is fridge & my main computer.

">If a tornado rips the roof off my house, I would assume insurance would replace the solar panels since they are, essentially, the roof.

"Yes it is the insurance companys business to restore you to the same condition you were in before a hail or wind storm. Check your insurance policy if you're serious as to what your policy states. It could be at either ""replacement cost""  or (ACV) actual cash value which is going to include a deduction for depreciation. Replacement cost is better. Again check your policy"
"That's not true about Teslas at all. The only time they ""magically"" added range during a natural disaster was for Model S vehicles that we're software locked to a lower range because the owners paid a lower price."

Man that's super expensive plus if you have an older house you have to replace the roof if it hasn't been done in the last 15 years. Hopefully costs go down and is more economical in a few years.
"Yes, but energy density isn’t really the issue with home battery. We don’t care if the battery is large and heavy, so long as it is cheap and long lasting."
"cool, thanks!"
"Lead acid in home power is usually stacks of car batteries.  They last a l
Fair amount of time but they're huge and need water servicing etc"
"I doubt NG is popular in earthquake prone areas.  Diesel or gas requires too much maintenance and fuel storage management.

Portable generators used 1-2 times a year get gummed up and eventually won't run.  They also can kill themselves when you try to run them 24/7 during an outage."
Isn’t the pay back on a powerwall really bad when PGE has NEM?
Incorrect. PG&E allows that.
They're the same cells but the slow rate of charge and discharge greatly helps prolong their useful life. Renault has found their used battery packs from cars sometimes regain capacity due to these long cycles once they've been adapted to stationary storage.
"I think all of those factors play a role. My guess the biggest issue is the lack of cells, though, considering that's the reason why they have been backlogged for the past few years. Since the other guy mentioned the weight issue, it could be solved by making it somewhat modular (ie let you pull out the cells, put the unit in place, install cells); albeit it would add some complexity."
"Yeah and you would also not have the functionality of the PW, a pretty box for it, wasted a tonne of time, have a car with no battery in it. CLOWN."

That you use so little energy.
That you use almost nothing per day.
Wow!  I’ve seen a lot of his stuff but didn’t know his name...he was an actor on a British comedy I used to watch with my aunt called “Red Dwarf”.

"Most American homes have central heat and air, so heating/cooling one room not very practical. 

Closest you can get for convenience is using fans + closing vents in seldom-used areas (closing vents not always convenient, easy, or effective, depending on house, though).

You can't compare US & European markets, mainly due to US's low cost of energy, which changes the financial calculus a lot and resulting societal norms a lot.

US also has a lot of extreme climates.  Lot of internal US is incredibly hot in summer, while also being extremely cold in winter."
"They sure do! Mine is just a regular onga pump. Consumes about 1kw of power. Adds up when run for the recommended hours a day.

"Our base varies between 0.1 - 0.5 kW according to the app. 

[Tesla Home Energy Screenshots](https://imgur.com/gallery/UpLnpt8)"
My baseload is exactly the same as yours. Around 400W.
You'll probably get a message on the screen saying regen limited FWIW.
I think they mean you get paid more when there’s low supply
"I know I've already asked you a lot of questions but, do you charge the battery solely on solar panels or do you rely on the grid to recharge you? I mean since you obviously have panels due to that 4.2 kWh going to the grid. 

But if 4.2 kWh were sent back while the batteries had to charge again, do I dare ask what you're generating usually and sending out?"
"No, but vented caustic fumes are.

I've been in data centers with a couple thousand lead acid batteries and they have to be follow hazardous containment protocols. 

But even small deployments of say 10-20 batteries can produce dangerous fumes."
"Fair enough, I guess car batteries also don’t need 2 year replacement right?"
"I'd have to double check my ""square up"" papers but I'm pretty sure rates are based on time of use. So during peak solar generation time of day I get pennies per kwh, but if I draw from grid during peak usage hours it's like $0.42/kwh. Time shifting is worth it."
Wouldn't having a power wall mean you don't have to care about what the grid pays you for solar? You're basically off the grid with solar+power walls
"It looks like it is much less than what I used to buy it from them for, but totally worth it because I’m getting something back at least and my 12 month solar payments are way less than our yearly cost of PG&E.

"I had understood they cancelled the program but after research they definitely have not. I'm surprised! A few friends who have solar were told they can't participate but that may be due to the fact that they don't own their panels and are instead leasing them. Alternatively, they (and me) may just be misinformed."
"no more than any other solar system charge controllers and most inverters are really cheap.

I felt the same about powerwall, its very expensive, I'm guessing people buy them so they don't have to plan or deal with a lot of the permit process."
"Powerwall has around 1050 cells vs around 4500 for model 3 LR I think. Pretty sure it's same cell type for both. 

The cooling system is different in that powerwall has a flat 'cold plate' on the end of each cell while the Tesla car batteries have cooling tubes that run between the cells (car is able to cool much faster for higher peak charge/discharge rates) since the cooling contact area is 4-5x higher on car vs powerwall. 

The inverter and circuitry take about about 15% of the enclosure volume on powerwall. 

Some public estimates put Tesla's battery cost at around $350/kw so you do the math on powerwall cost vs model 3 battery pack."
You realise there are options for that requirement? I'd rather Tesla didnt make the powerwall oversized for the majority of its users.
"At a cost of $32,000 and larger space? No thanks, I'll go diy at that price (even if it won't be as elegant).

"Yeah electricity is the least of it.. chemicals and maintenance is easily 2-3x the cost of electricity, and that doesn’t include the cost of putting a pool in. ($50-100k?)

You want variable speed that runs more hours. You could maybe save half the power if you get one that runs all the time at a slower speed.
"It depends on your pool really but you can find some efficient ones here: https://www.energystar.gov/productfinder/product/certified-pool-pumps/results

[Here is one from me](https://www.reddit.com/r/solar/comments/c6f5z3/new_9885_kw_system_84_kw_inverter_1_week_and_a/).

[Here's mine just showing usage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clarity/comments/c34pdo/power_for_l2_charging_clarity_vs_normal_usage_and/)

"Ah yes, the low wind bit."
"You don’t need the grid for anything because the panels are more than enough to supply power to the home while recharging the batteries and the batteries are more than enough to pay through the night until recharged by the panels the next day. 

Typically the panels are producing 4.6 kWh, the home is using about 0.3 - 0.5 kWh so the remainder is going back to the grid every hour. Yesterday, 23.2 kWh were sent back to the grid."
"Some deep cycle modern LA batteries are sealed and fume less.  Don’t get me wrong, I’m not advocating for LA batteries; they are 130yo tech and not very efficient, but I challenge the idea that they are unusable."
" Depending on the use, they can totally die in two years."
"Yes you are off the grid, but it matters because once the Powerwalls are fully charged, all that excess energy goes back to the grid. I’d like to receive something over nothing. It doesn’t seem like much, but paying hundreds less to PG&E per month is great AND getting a check back at the end of the year would be nice as well.

"Unfortunately other lithium ion backup battery solutions are also expensive, all the ones I have researched are morr expensive than powerwalls (often $1/Wh)"
Uh no battery cost estimates are $100-140/kWh.
"No, I'm not aware of any single container systems that store 50kwh. You could've just replied with a link if they're available rather than try to insult a stranger who you have no idea about. The highest I've seen was 20kwh (MB). My point is the average US household uses anywhere from 10-30kwh/day and that is without an EV. You run into several days or a week of cloudy weather and the 13.5kwh system isn't going to last long, and I don't find spending the cost on multiple to be a good solution either considering the cost and size of them already. Ideally they would offer a range of sizes, I realize that isn't going to be done for a long time given it adds complexity to manufacturing and Tesla isn't in a position to afford that (irrespective of the huge backlog they already have)."
"It's still 26% next year, no reason not to include it."
"I really don't get what you expect from them. They have one of the better price:performance solutions out there. You can stack walls for those you need.

If they had DYI pricing they would be miles ahead of the competition and would lose money per unit sold.

As long as you know the risk and the right steps (heat diffusion, fuses between each cluster, balanced cells etc. etc.) to take for a DIY wall then it's an alright alternate approach."
There's not DIY project that can take less space at this price. Most of the space is taken by the cells and you can't find more energy dense cells because Tesla is already making one of the most energy dense cells.
I'm not sure what cost has to do when your initial assertion was they were limited to 13.5 kwh.
"2k sf for me. We have a ranch and most A/C is used on the main level (central A/C). Basement has two high efficiency Mitsubishi minisplit units, only one in use generally, and only during the day. I charge at work 95% of the time. We use about 50kwh/day average...."
is it really??? is he still in it?
"Yeah, pretty much in the US unless you are getting a full custom home, there’s only minor attempts made on efficiency - mostly just the minimum that they can do to use it as a selling point."
"Hi, it’s me your kid and friend."
I guess it depends on your utility bills.  If you're going to save $3k pa then that's a 10% ROE which is still not bad from a cash flow standpoint.  Unless you can find another investment that will give you that return.
Those are some hefty spikes.
"Nice try but you've been caught shilling for Big Lead Acid Battery, you can't escape the wrath of Big Lithium Ion Battery - I do really wish these lobbies would come up with snappier names though."
"I'm referring to fumeless batteries. 

They aren't fumefree."
Source?
Source? Powerwall may be cheaper since cooling system is gimped in relation to car.
"The point is that the system is scalable. You don't need single container,the power walls can stack together into a single brick too keeping them in a singular form factor. 

If you're upset about cost/unit that's a different discussion than you're having entirely."
"You're right, I wish they were 50kwh. Cant wait to install a 500kg battery inside someone's house. From the back of a van. CLOWN."
"It is a perfectly valid comment. You hear a device had a certain cost and think hey, is a good deal. Then you hear it has much smaller capacity than you thought and you are disappointed."
Yep..he's also doing a joke podcast intro as Kryten :)
I had three new homes and wanted a tankless water heater in each. The builders wanted to charge 2k for putting one in; despite the cost being cheaper or slightly more than a tank. They wouldn’t install a high efficiency heat pump for any cost. The exterior insulation was only standard with no option to upgrade at all. I think the next house I’ll build myself...
"Get out of the pool, the burgers are ready!"
Yeah my electricity bill is anywhere from $80-$120 per month average.

"I'm sorry I didn't add anything about the price in my first comment, it was just a quick reply on my phone and didn't expect people to get negative about it. The price is definitely a large issue, and I assumed that was obvious. It's not that Tesla is super far off on price either, it's more of first mover tech pricing, so for the majority of people the home lion batteries don't make sense from a financial standpoint. Like most tech, hopefully that should improve over time."
[deleted]
you may not be wrong.. but it doesn’t excuse you from being an ass
"Thank you, that's basically all I was saying. I had the car packs as my reference in my mind, considering the powerwalls contain at least somewhat similar volume the number surprised me. On the website Tesla didn't make it clear how much capacity was actually in them, just used their calculator on the site, and then months later I found out it was 13.5kwh. This makes me think the calculator for how long it will last is being generous (ie probably assuming your solar panels are getting optimal sunlight, and that you aren't running your HVAC)."
"Can't believe at this years Fully Charged Live Bobby was there (obviously), Craig Charles was Djing a set and Danny John-Jules was there as a guest. Boys from the Dwarf! I guess they fell out with Chris Barrie."
"> I think the next house I’ll build myself...

I was an Owner-Builder and the experience was not pleasant."
"I agree completely on the price. Batteries are super expensive. I think you got the reaction you did because you said you wished there was a larger unit, but never said you wished it was larger at the same price. 

I imagine prices will come down but I would be surprised to ever see the price reduced to 1/3 of the current rate of $/kwh without a new technology."
"No he started off saying he wished they were larger. They can literally be any size. He verified this by saying he didn't know if any larger units and he wanted one that was 50kw. He never mentioned price. What he's talking about doesn't make an sense unless he did not realize they were scalable, or if he wanted only one unit, even though the infrastructure to support 2-3 units is no different than one unit."
+1
"There’s a program from the UK, that has people building their own homes. That’s usually the case. The experience is never as good as they think it will be. But I don’t know how I could get the type of house I want.. grid independent and highly efficient."

"I definately got the house I wanted, and I know it's better quality of build than I would have gotten with a project builder, but I'm not sure it was worth the stress.  
Side note: do not ever allow your family to involve themselves, no matter how much they insist on 'helping'."
Yeah it certainly wasn't super clear. Especially because I'd be surprised to see such a large price decrease without new battery tech.
"I know they are scalable. price/size of the unit for the battery storage were both of my concerns, or rather what caused my surprise when I found out they were only 13.5kwh. My reference frame was their car packs. Model 3 LR module volume is 2717 and 2938 in^3, so total around 11310 in^3 while the powerwall 2 is 8200 in^3 (I wasn't able to find the S/X pack dimensions, and yes I know the 3 is more advanced/higher density). I just expected more, and didn't think the circuitry would have taken up such a significant portion of the powerwall (especially considering the powerwall is not the only component that needs to be installed)."
covered by warranty or you footing the bill?
Look at all that molex
Cloth seats. Don't see too many of those...
What floor mats are those?
Never knew model S has built in penis pump behind the main screen! Not that I ever seen one in person. 😂
New interior refresh is looking crazy!
Now I understand how they plan to make the Y have much less cable lol
All that for a flipping screen?!
both of my screens in my 2018 model S have the yellow banding.
I have the same coffee mug!
The Mobile Tech can do this at your house??
GUTS!!!!! Do-do-do-do you have it!?!?? GUTS!!!!!
Tesla’s ingenuity is what can happen when manufacturing is brought back to the United States. When R&D and production share the same lunch room.
"What model is it?
What’s the reason for Screen Replacement?"
How is it's blood pressure?
I would be afraid of rattles after this.
Model S interior refresh leaked! No screen as your Tesla burns information onto your retina
Still probably cheaper than replacing the screen on an Apple Watch.
NSFW tag please.
That's a lot of stuff to disconnect and remove to get at that screen! Mine is going to have to go under the knife (or the pump) soon as I have some yellowing on my brand new screen.
how much empty space is there?
Did the screen bleed?
Cool even the touchscreen has an airbag.
Looks better naked
"I haven't seen a lot of cars under their dash, so I don't know what I was expecting, but the dash wiring looks pretty well managed considering all the tech in it.

If you don't mind me asking, what's the time on a replacement like this?"
"Can anybody figure out where the MCU is?

Hoping I can eventually upgrade to the newer MCU."
"I had my Model 3 screen replaced the other day (found a dust speck under the glass), and mobile service tech did it in like 15 mins and it was his first time replacing a Model 3 screen. I wasn’t watching the whole process but it looked very simple - access panel on the bottom side of the bridge of the screen, unscrew, pull screen out whole, and disconnect cables (I think there were only one or two). Then just reverse with the new part. No other part of the dash or center console was touched."
At least mark it nsfw smh

They do not have to remove that much!

ewwwww molex
I hate when my computer parts come with molex for power because then i need an extra power supply cable connected to my modular PSU. But I don’t mind for car electronics. I got a 360 degree camera system and it has a molex for a sensor and I don’t mind.

"That sort of thing ain't my bag, baby."
"Lol.

I think that's actually a tool the tech has. It's a flat bag they can slide into places and fill with air to separate parts."
Those are really interesting airbags they are using to hold the dash cover up.  I wonder if they are off-the-shelf or custom made for Tesla.
I figured it was a bike horn.
"I thought it was an old-timey car horn type thing, little honking thing.  Interested to know what it really is.  I think it is in the comments.  But penis pump?  Goodness."
" I don't even know what this is! This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.

I thought that the three had a minimalist interior
"In fairness this is an S. I believe the 3 already has far less cabling than the S or X. Like half.

I don't personally believe the 95% wiring reduction claims on the Y over the 3."
"Looks like a lot but took 45 mins for a the guy. There's only like 5 Cables, and you just pop out the dash"
I think this is the most labor intensive repair Tesla has.
are they every going to fix this? I just keep my screen on night mode
Wish Tesla would fix this ugly shit.
"Contigo from Costco.  Gripe: If you grab it too quickly, you get a snoot full of hot coffee spray."
Yep he pulled up in Model X 90D
"They can. Watched my tech guy dismantle the X dashboard. So many little details and tricks, but these fellas are properly trained and are a joy to observe."
That's an old model S. You can tell it's an older model because it does not have a center console.
"2014, replaced cause of bubbles under screen"
Looks simple compared to other interiors I've seen.
Yup. We got our screen replaced and now the dash rattles where it did not before. Sigh.
No the bubbles just started appearing
45 mins really quick
The guy said they stopped using MCU 1 so if you replace it chances are it'll be the new one
"Yeah it was pretty quick 45 min, only a couple cables connected to the MCU, but it’s embedded in the model S interior it’s imbedded in the dash so he popped out the panels. I watched the whole thing just in case cause warranty is about to end. Prolly more clunky the M3 lol"

Shock absorber for the screen? Weird thing
"No, this looks like an S/X, That much didn't have to be removed to replace the screen, Mine was replaced by mobile last year late because it yellowed around the edges, They didn't remove nearly this much to do that."
This is a 2014 Model S and the screen got bubbles under warranty so they came to replace it no questions asked. It was known issue
Was it the yellow border?
"If anyone else has this issue and is willing to go through a little trouble, the MCU dying is a VERY common issue on MCU1 cars caused by the flash wearing out. You can replace the eMMC chip on the board for significantly less money than buying a whole new MCU. It takes some technical skill and the help from a shop that can solder the tiny chips or you can send it off to a third party person to repair. That will cost more but significantly less than $3600."

Thanks!
">They are very good but passenger side curles up when I accelerate.

Haha nice."
"> I think any matt not tacked down would in P3D :))

The MaxPider ones are quite rigid, and can't really ""roll up"" at all. They also have some sort of ""velcro-y"" stuff on the bottom, which gives them a bit of grip to the floor. Might be a good choice if the rolling up is a problem for passengers during launches."
"I have the Weather Tech ones and they seem to stay put, I think they are a little heavier."
Do they have thingies to stick to the velcro on the floorboard?
"They look super good, thanks!"

"I was just kidding, but actually the acceleration has same effect pushing blood into all extremities."
Yup. We use it to aid in dash pad removal so it doesn't damage the trim.
"Correct, it safely/evenly inflates the dash or other parts without breaking them so you can either get to screws, or other clips/panels."

It's off the shelf.  I have one that I got as a gift.  I think it was bought at Home Depot
"I saw them first used by tow truck operators to wedge a window open to jimmy the locks, then by carpenters to ""shim"" a door or window when installing. And of course mechanics."
Looks like ol Elon thought of everything. Still looks like too much work.
I didn't even think about that as an option. Hard to see in direct sunlight?
"Oh hey I just got the same repair done, they took the car for the day and gave me a loaner instead of mobile service"
Are they replacing with an updated Screen or an old screen?
"Yeah, not sure why I got some downvotes for that comment. Take apart any car you'd be lucky not to get some type of rattle."
I read in another thread that they weren't upgrading MCUs because the wiring was different and impacted the 2nd screen as well. Something about compatibility
Thank you.
"They no longer replace screen with yellow borders, so I’m told be SC🤯"
Bubbles!
Where is the yellow border?
I have this problem and they haven’t dealt with it yet.  They told me that they don’t have a fix and it yet as t keeps occurring even on replaced screens.
"Yeah - I'm just looking for the eMMC chip to replace on mine - I was able to get the original one back that they replaced, so I want to change the eMMC chip that's worn out due to too many writes, and then sell it second hand for like $1000 - had this been an option to me, I wouldn't have spent the $3,600... but I couldn't find the eMMC chip online fast enough, and I needed the car ready asap."

I thought it was part of ludicrous mode prep sequence.
Should just be a dock for a screen and not a 3 hr job.
Actually not too bad
Recently there's been a push for doing more and more via a mobile team. I couldn't believe the things they already can do (and carry equipment to do it). And then he told me about how cool it would get with a tesla pickup truck. It sounded like they would get prototypes before the general public launch.
Updated!
"Tesla has actually been pretty good about eliminating rattles. In the first two years everything I mentioned they attempted to address with foam or felt tape and I think they reduced or eliminated over half of the cabin squeaks during the annual service visits. But when I got the MCU replaced, I got new rattles and we're out of warranty now so it's on me. Maybe I'll pop the dash cover and push some felt tape in there one day."
I think bubbles and yellow borders are different issues.
Bubbles?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NzPd-xW4YY
I heard on here that there's a fix incoming. Not sure how verified that was.
"Same. Was told January or I could just get a new screen but couldn’t guarantee it’d fix it long term. Opted to wait. 7 months later now they are saying there is a special tool they’ll get in the fall to get moisture out of the screen. Although now I can’t get screen replacement without paying.

This problem has been happening for a few years. Disappointed they haven’t addressed this."
"I was told just last week at my service center in EU that they‘re about to get a tool that allows them to remove the yellow border or something. Apparently the problem is the frame pressing down on the edges of the screen. They said if I wanted the screen replaced it wouldn‘t be covered by warranty, but the fix would be."
"Before you sell it, you may want to look into what kind of personal data is stored on those chips. Your VIN is in there and also I think some SSH keys belonging to your car. Not sure what kind of access someone would get with that, but they could maybe tie their car to your account and bill your for supercharging? IDK."
It’s the connectors.
Connector supplier
Molex is a company. They make automotive electrical connectors. A lot of people remember them as the power connector for old hard drives in computers.

Hey my 2004 CRV’s floor mats stay down at all speeds. (Sometimes)
"I bought them from the Tesla store, they are branded Tesla but manufacturered by WeatherTech.  It seems they have an exclusive deal to sell them through the Tesla store at the moment."
lemme know what you find. I have weather tech universal ones that I am happy with but I will upgrade them (hopefully) next spring
He literally said 45 minutes in the comment you replied to
"Yeah mobile service is littt, got some parts replaced from a tech that came in a Model S. Here's hoping I can see the pickups early here in Fremont!"
"Great.

Are they also changing the MCU?"
That’s true but they replaced it before for the yellow border issue.
Different issues but likely the same cause. The screen wasn't automotive grade so the heat/sun/vibration got to it.
You beat me to it. I was told exactly the same thing so I guess there must be something to it. Good to know.
"Behold, the special tool has arrived. 
https://cleantechnica.com/2019/07/06/tesla-rolls-out-uv-light-fix-for-yellowing-screen-border/"
Same same same
"I have the same ones, the full set for interior and trunk/frunk. They are very nice!"
Just checked and no dice on the “custom” ones then ran through google; apparently the scuttle butt is that WeatherTech makes the Tesla branded ones since there have been reports of people getting the Tesla all weather mats shipped to them still marked as manufactured by WeatherTech LLC.  So tough to know when they will be able to sell their own branded ones.
"to take apart, which is usually the easy part."
Same here. I was wondering if it was ever going to happen. I am still in warranty though. 2018 purchase.
Not same
Same
I don’t have a car
Haha that's awesome
"Can confirm. I got mine when they first came out, they came straight from weathertech on the shipping label."
Taking apart is not usually the easier part when working on the dash from my experience. Much easier to get what you need done and put it back together than taking it apart. Just my experience though.
Shame
Always the same

The weird jet motor sound is the dyno lab pushing the motors as hard as it possibly can
"I could see Julian enlisting bubbles to help steal electricity from a power line to recharge the Tesla, and then maybe one episode that makes it catch fire or something and explode."
"So if this is a testing warehouse, and a lot of the vehicles are covered.... is that a TRUCK shape? (Lowest center lot, rt side, second from top) (far right side along edge, near top, just below the semi trailers.)

Skunk works
It looks like Build-a-Tesla in the top-middle of the parking lot.
I got the Tesla’s in the back
"Probably where they keep the devs.  Don't want to expose them to too much sunlight, burns em' right up."

Fuck oil companies! Am I right!?
I read it as Sunnydale.  I envisioned a kind of Buffy/Tesla crossover show and wondered what the hell that mad genius was up to now.

It's a 3rd party converting to mini pick-up trucks.
"Where in Sunnyvale is this picture?  Your snip doesn't include address.

I know a building in Vancouver that looks a bit like ghat. I was shocked how many Tesla vehicles were parked there. Looked it up to he sure it wasn't a new Tesla store.
Anyone think that the pickup truck at the bottom right of the picture is a model for the tesla pickup truck? Looks a little steam punk to me!
"I bet there's a ""secret spot"" in Palo Alto somewhere...."

This building was more engineering test and development--retrofitting specific bits of M3 design into MS for subsystem testing, and the original (normal-looking) Semi was built here. There is also office space and conference rooms that make a nice meeting spot for people coming from both DC and Fremont... Essentially the entire M3 assembly order and assembly line layout were worked out there."

The only problem is the infrastructure needed to clone low-cost Teslas will require an expansion of battery production by 8x--- which is cost prohibitive to most everyone except government-backed money supplies (like the Chinese state banks).
It's a very standard practice in the industry.

"Yup.  If you look at the final acceleration of a Falcon 9 or its second stage it is pretty high (just watch the speed tick up), and that is with the engines throttled down.

That said it has nothing on the Sprint's 100g's of acceleration from stationary to Mach 10 in 5 seconds, and that is starting from ground level."

"Would it even make much of a difference?  If you're just using compressed gas I wouldn't think you could store much impulse in something the size of a car.  Now, if you're chemically generating the gas that would be another matter, but now you're talking about explosive materials/etc."
FUUUUUUUCK YEAHHHHHHH
"I hate to say it, but Elon Musk's Twitter isn't exactly a reliable source of information about Elon Musk's plans."
"Yeah, I guess it would have to be.  Probably well over 1g - it wouldn't even decelerate with exactly 1g of thrust, and that thing comes to a stop pretty quickly.  Doesn't it use 3 engines to land?  (Just going from memory - could be one, but I think that the first falcon heavy center core was lost because it couldn't start enough engines.)"
"Gravity in low earth orbit is barely any lower than on the surface.  Right now you're standing 4000mi from the center of the earth, and orbit is <1000mi higher up.  

Drag isn't all that much lower compared to what it was on the pad either.  When the rocket is stationary on the pad, drag is zero.  We were talking about the time it takes to get to 60mph, and at that speed drag is negligible.  I wouldn't be surprised if stage 2 operates in higher drag conditions, since despite the near-vacuum of space the velocity is vastly higher and drag goes up with the square of velocity.  Now, drag is certainly higher shortly after launch when the velocity starts getting into the hundreds of mph.

The main factor is mass, and I suspect it accounts for >99% of the difference in acceleration between initial liftoff and SECO.  1/9th the thrust, but roughly 1/30th the mass (~16t vs 500t assuming max payload).  It also is getting nearly 1g more acceleration due to being horizontal instead of vertical at that point so all its thrust is going into increasing velocity and not opposing gravity.  That isn't because gravity is reduced, but because it is normal to its thrust and thus does not oppose it, in the same way that a car driving along the ground doesn't have to oppose the the force of gravity unless it is moving up a hill."
Deceleration = Braking. Smashing things = breaking
Whoosh
He had a McLaren F1 that he didn't insure and then wrecked!?!?

"Thanks, edited"
It has actual brakes...
"A.K.A KITT's ""Turbo Boost"""
">  If you're just using compressed gas I wouldn't think you could store much impulse in something the size of a car.

SpaceX COPVs. You know the ones they use to steer Falcon 9. 2 of them fit in the back seat.

That's enough thrust to hover for several seconds.

There is also going to be an electric turbo pump, it's designed to recharge during straights and as a regeneration reservoir during braking."
It’s compressed air and it’s enough to significantly improve the performance of the car.
He’s talked about it on several podcasts as well.
">  Doesn't it use 3 engines to land?

Sometimes.

Depends on the mission energy requirements.

Low energy missions usually do a 3-1 burn. 3 for entry, and one for landing.


The Merlin at lowest throttle is well over 1g thrust. Just one, all by itself, can't hover a mostly empty F9 because it's too powerful.

So they do what's called a ""hover slam"". That's where the computer aims for a spot below the deck. Then they burn either one or three engines depending on how much fuel is left (more engines for less fuel) and the computer adjusts it's aim up as it descends so it's aiming right at the ground at 0g *just* before it starts going back up again, they power down the rocket.

It's not a suicide burn because a suicide burn is defined as 100% thrust until the tank is empty to land at zero velocity.

A hover slam is much more controlled, and doesn't require running out of fuel.

The reason they use three Merlins for high energy landings is because waiting longer to start the maneuver saves fuel. Using three engines means they can stop faster so they can start stopping lower. I also believe it lets them run the rockets closer to their optimal thrust if they use three.

**Would you like to know more?**

https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/4isnn3/estimating_the_fuel_savings_of_a_3engine_landing/"
"They've never had a successful 3 engine landing, but they've tried.. twice? Usually one, but 3 for some prior slowing. 9-1-3-1 burns."
They sometimes used 3 engines for the re-entry burn
"Cool, thanks for the explanation!"
"I'm pretty sure I could break some things with a cold gas thruster powerful enough to hurl a Tesla at >1g through the air.

I found some test footage for proof:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBQ0PSxPRjc"
[indeed](https://youtu.be/mOI8GWoMF4M)
Pretty sure he said it’s mostly for turning. The weight of the roadster + thrusters would mean it could handle corners much better at speed than other cars in it’s class.
That's an expensive mistake. But luckily happened then and not today. F1 prices are around 15 times more expensive than they were new.
"Energy dissipated through traditional brakes is lost to heat.  Energy used to run a compressor to charge a COPV is stored for later use (some of it at least, I don't know what sort of efficiencies air compressors work at)."
"Sure, but what is the benefit of all that gear vs just making the motor bigger?  I gotta imagine that the payoff of an extra 100kg of motor mass is better than throwing in 100kg of pumps, tanks, and thrusters."
"Fair enough, I just think it's best to take what he says he plans to do with a grain of salt, because it's easy for those plans to fall through or lead to unexpected delays and such. I'll believe it when I see it, until then I see it as just a neat idea he felt like sharing"
"Interesting that 3 engines makes that much of a difference, but it makes sense that it would make some difference.  Lower starting altitude means more dynamic pressure which means more aerobraking.  

It is impressive that the performance of this engine is consistent enough that this works, since they can't correct for overperformance by throttling down.  I guess they could just start the burn late enough that minimum throttle would ensure a crash and then correct by throttling up.  Even so when the mass of the rocket is so low even small changes in engine performance are going to have a big impact on relative velocity.  This is really no different than trying to do a docking maneuver with the main engines..."
Hes a brilliant guy. But not a brilliant story teller. lmao.
"It can be used for turning, accelerating, decelerating, and hopping into the air."
"Probably not great, but it's comparing against zero. Kind of a cool thought."
But the thing is it takes quite a bit of energy to replenish that air. So using the high energy from braking is good. Also consider track use for a second. Acceleration and braking one after the other and continous use of the air. There you could see lots of improvement. Wow I'm tired and can't be bithered to make my comment better readable. Not native english.
Bigger motors are not going to help you if you are traction limited. That is why you need thrusters to go even faster.
You'll hear it *before* you see it.
"> I guess they could just start the burn late enough that minimum throttle would ensure a crash and then correct by throttling up.

That's exactly what they do.

>  Even so when the mass of the rocket is so low even small changes in engine performance are going to have a big impact on relative velocity.

Computers. Fast ones. And not that aerospace grade crap. Real computers, redundant off the shelf PowerPC cores running code written in LabVIEW on Linux. Instead of trying to get it right once, they make a best guess and make a few billion corrections a second. 

It's the John Carmack method.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillo_Aerospace

Fun fact the old BFR (Big Fucking Rocket) code name was a reference to John's BFG (Big Fucking Gun) from Doom. A nice tip of the hat since Starship is highly derivative of John's method simply scaled up (that he pioneered in Doom's rendering engine particularly the float/int cheat on the Pentium). Even going so far as SpaceX's trend of hiring video game developers, those that think in systems and dream in code.

> This is really no different than trying to do a docking maneuver with the main engines...

As long as Data from Star Trek is the one doing the docking maneuver, then yes.

It's probably physically possible to do it the old DC-X method. But it would likely never be reliable enough, economical enough, nor scale enough, compared to throwing compute units at the problem."
 You are absolutely correct. But better than that host lady. Shudder.
"Ok, I'm still a bit skeptical of the idea, but that at least makes sense.  Though at that point I start to wonder about steering/etc, and the payoff vs more conventional solutions like spoilers, larger tires, and so on.

It just seems really over the top and I'd have to see the math..."
"The first stages aren't really spending that much time in solar flare conditions anyway, so the aerospace grade stuff doesn't matter as much."
"I've seen the math (it's buried in old reddit threads and Elon tweats). 

It's revolutionary.

More of a wing in ground effect lifting body with wheel assist. Like an Ekranoplan is not a boat nor a plane. Well [this thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUpXtYHoNoU) might be a more accurate analog.

And that's just the aero aspects.

There is also the need to consider it's only possible with AI control. Even if 6DoF was within human reach to control, the 2D driving inputs are insufficient. User input ""aka"" the steering wheel will be a request that the AI carries out. If the AI doesn't agree with the request it will output the next closest acceptable trajectory. Roughly similar to how aim assist works in shooters and driving assist works in arcady driving games. So technically no human will ever drive a refresh Roadster. I expect the fastest lap times will be achieved with pure AI.

Speaking of fast lap times, racing is physically brutal. The Roadster could easily exceed human control ability. Yes, you can ***survive*** the g forces, but you can't think or operate a race car. It's not like a plane or even a fighter jet, where if you are pulling hard g, it's a long constant turn around a point of reference through a smooth medium, with little lateral force. A race car has chaotic conditions, around a road that may or may not be a constant radius, assuming it's not circle tracks are turning much much more often, while road texture is rattling the teeth out of your head no matter how good the suspension is. You simply can't drive in those conditions, and unless you are exceptionally athletic it would be torture to simply endure.

Depending on track rules as written, being able to jump corners alone could take all the records for all the tracks (that have switchback corners at least).

If you really think about it. All those features would be exceptionally useful off road as well, way way way off road, Mars off road. Jack up the suspension, add life support, and the new Roadster would make an exceptional Mars rover, able to jump over anything it couldn't drive over. So you also have to consider the Roadster refresh is also part of SpaceX's Mars program R&D project, so synergy and splitting the cost. Splitting costs is a huge deal for both companies.

The Tesla Roadster + SpaceX package will be as advanced from the ICE car, as the ICE car is advanced from the steam locomotive.

Tesla + OpenAI + SpaceX = Literally equivalent or greater than KITT from Knight rider. Or at least it's beta, software might take a few years to catch up to the hardware, but who knows, AI developments are accelerating."
"Why would you want to lift it off the ground, unless to clear rough surfaces? Lifting a boat out of the water reduces drag, but the same is not true of a car. Friction with the ground only helps a car."
"> Why would you want to lift it off the ground, unless to clear rough surfaces? Lifting a boat out of the water reduces drag, but the same is not true of a car. Friction with the ground only helps a car.

One example would be to jump over a wrecked car in front of you. For more examples watch Knight Rider."
I found this quite remarkable. And that more than half the other CEOs have only been at their post for ~2 years.
"Musk is necessary for Tesla’s current growth, shareholders know this."
"If you think about it Tesla has accomplished close to what SpaceX has done for the Aerospace Industry.  Tesla is a green start up that actually became a real worldwide brand.  It was able to survive the onslaught of a media attack campaign and financial attack from lots of multiple players from the automotive cartel, hedge fund and investment banks, politicians, media companies.  

Unfortunately there is a sizable portion of the human population that are not thinkers and they tend to believe what is distributed to them.  They inadvertently become part of the media army furthering the misinformation campaign.  

Elon if you are reading this, I just want to tell you that you have done an amazing work on everything especially Space X.  Glad he didn’t sellout and continues to disrupt the status quo.  You probably felt like quitting having to deal with the idiots at SEC, but stay strong."
Tech company > auto company
"When he got started, Tesla was a garage car maker looking up to brands like Lotus, now they sell more cars in days. If he was some generic pump and dump startup bro, he'd be gone with his billions years ago."
"Geely (owners of Volvo, Lotus and other brands) was founded 32 years ago by Li Shufu, who is still chairman (not sure if they have a CEO, he is probably the man). He started making refrigerators in 1986, then motorcycles, then small vans in 1986 and finally cars since 2002 - 17 years ago. 

Sorry guys. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geely"
Without Elon there is NO Tesla
That’s amazing for a car company that most don’t even consider a car company!
"It purely because he qualifies as a founder and has enough stock to control the board.  Every other major auto manufacturer who would qualify hasn't been led by a founder in a long time. 

Henry Ford led Ford for 40 years.  That's the peer that's fair to judge Elon against."

And by a big huge difference I would say.
"Is tusler truly an automotive manufacturer?

Because once FSD is a reality I see Tesla as a robotics company."
It's a buddy buddy bullshit. Half the ceos are not even eligible. They are just there to make money and gtfo. Golden parachute baby.
"I think Tesla is bigger than just Elon now. If he left his role, they'd be fine. The snowball has left the top of the mountain."
No one stays long in pump and dumps.  They get the best stock price based bonus package they can get and then move onto the next company to fleece.
Thats a great stat
"What's kind of remarkable by contrast is how big of an unknown literally every other auto company's CEO is. Unless you google it, or are a car nerd who reads a ton of car news I doubt you could name the CEO of any car company other then Tesla. I doubt most of the public could either.

Ford used to be ruled by Ford the man, and Ford the man got a bunch of media attention for his eccentric ways and controversial things he does similar to Elon today, but those days are gone for Ford. Ford's Grandson may have taken over when he left/died, but the Ford family hasn't remained in control of Ford the company."
*BUT THOSE QUARTERLY RESULTS...*
"It's not at all surprising.

  
The auto industry is a mature one.  Auto CEOs are hired for production guidance.  While there aren't many people qualified to do that job, when there is a transition, it generally won't materially affect stock price.  It's a great gig.  Eat shit for a few years, or as long as you can tolerate it, and walk away with a big package.  


Tesla is a growth company.  If Musk leaves, Tesla's stock collapses and the company may soon collapse afterward."
"The only major US car manufacturer that's even been around longer than Tesla is Ford, so even if they had no turnover ever both GM and Chrysler wouldn't be able to have administrative staff tenured as long  as Musk and other Tesla originals."
It makes me wonder what those CEOs are truly bringing in terms of values to those companies.
Founders are parents. MBAs are babysitters.
"It’s mostly that a lot of long tenured CEOs all recently ran into some serious issues. Marchionne died all of a sudden after surgery and then Ghosn got thrown in the slammer. VW also had Diseselgate so Winterkorn was out. 

Normally CEOs tend to stay for fairly long runs."
"Without even trying, how does he do it? It's 90% ..."
"That's because Tesla is Musk's baby and they innovate.

The Big 3 have business school type corporate leadership that inherited a business that has lasted for generations. They are not in the business to innovate, they are in the business of making money which makes them far less interesting (but still very rich)."
"Nissan one is going to prison for fraud. I only found out because his daughter ran some LinkedIn alternative called levo or something I used that went belly up.

VW might be too after that emissions scandal."
"That’s what happens when the Founder let goes his control and gets replaced by other people. 

Elon Musk’s tenure as CEO is not comparable with others because he has founded this company, he is young and not anywhere near retirement age and the board does not want to replace him. 

Dieter Zetsche was the head of Mercedes for 13 years until he retired. Carlos Ghosn was the CEO of Renault from 2005 to 2018, when his criminal activity was discovered.

This is not really a big deal considering it’s Elon Musk, the founder."
"It is a private company, that is why. 
Public companies get rid of them every 3 to 5 years with golden parachutes."
"As a shareholder I think Tesla is succeeding despite Musk's efforts, and they'd be better off without him."
"He's done it with SpaceX and Tesla, now hopefully he will do the same with the Boring Company and revolutionise tunneling."
"Well SpaceX has essentially already won with a near monopoly on US launches, Tesla is still small by comparison. But it will get there with time."
Why not both? The fact that it's both is what makes it so unique.
">not sure if they have a CEO, he is probably the man

[Cong Hui An is the president and CEO of Geely Holdings Group](https://www.marketscreener.com/business-leaders/Cong-Hui-An-0BCPJN-E/biography/) since 2003, so he's probably your man.

An argument could also be made for Sheng Yue Gui, CEO of the subsidiary Geely Automotive Holdings since February 2006.

Either way, they're both still ahead of Musk, who became CEO of Tesla in October 2008."
"The product is great, but they need his character."
That doesn't sound like a healthy business
"I don't think this is true. I think the current lineup for Tesla is plenty to keep it going if Musk were to be hit by a bus tomorrow morning.

They'd probably stop tweeting stupid shit, and stop running full steam ahead. Prolly get their ducks in a row and earn some cash doing business more IAW a traditional business model.

Musk leaving Tesla would make Tesla boring, and probably a safer investment. But I don't think it would kill it anymore. 3 years ago? Sure. But not after the model 3."
"JB, Guillen."
[deleted]
"He was openly discussing his plans to leave Tesla to concentrate on his other companies 2 years ago.  Tesla's board offered him the largest compensation package of any CEO in history to keep working at Tesla, and shareholders approved (twice in fact, because after the vote shorts organized a vote to dismiss him)"
He’s not a founder.
"Elon also has skin in the game like no other auto CEO. His compensation is completely at risk and tied to the performance of Tesla. Other auto CEOs are former managers who rose through the ranks and charmed the board. They didn’t bet their personal fortune on the companies they lead, and most of them don’t have the courage to do something like that."
It's a Silicon Valley/west coast tech company. Apple used to only make computers. Amazon used to only sell books. Google used to only be a search page. Tesla used to only make luxury cars.
Automation and energy.
"This is part of why Tesla share prices vary widely among experts. Some only look at the cars, others look at the potential value of FSD/etc."
"I just classify it as a ""future technologies"" company. Even though that doesn't exactly fit. At some point I expect Tesla to expand to other areas once the vehicle market is on lock."

"Yes, cuz apple does so well without jobs"
"Mary Barra of GM is pretty well-known. She's an Auto industry veteran and worked her way up through the ranks. not saying anything about her performance, just that she's certainly a well-known and powerful CEO."
"Sergio and Iacocca have passed. Ghosn is in turmoil. Dr. Z, Bob Lutz and Alan Mulally retired. Bill Ford, the great-grandson, is the only one I can think of that's working now; and I'm an enthusiast. Most current CEOs dont seem to care about having a public facing image."
"Lee Iaccoca is/was a good example. Ferdinand Piech was also well known, and Dieter Zetsche had bit of a rockstar quality about him. Enzo Ferrari obviously and even Sergio Marchionne. Gianni Agnelli is a considered almost holy in Italy."
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3670  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/29357)
I think Musk might be so well known for the wrong reasons. No other CEO has been as crazy and vocal on twitter as Musk. Any other CEO would have been fired for doing some of the stuff Musk did.
Henry ford is the CEO of Ford. Duh
"Elon Musk isn't the first CEO of Tesla, nor even the second.  He started as Chairman of the Board and principly the angel investor, and really didn't get involved with the company until the ""year of hell"" where it looked like both Tesla and SpaceX were both going to go bankrupt.  The scary thing is how Elon Musk called last year more stressful than that year of hell when he took over as CEO.

To be fair, he sort of would like to go back to just being chair.  It would have to be an incredible CEO and likely somebody from within the company too.  JB Straubel would be a good pick but I hope he gets a few more years experience as senior VP before getting pushed into that job.  There are some other long time top employees who would do a great job if push came to shove.

If the SpaceX Starship starts to go to Mars, expect Elon Musk to step down.  That transition would be pretty tame though."
Am I misreading or are you saying Tesla has been around longer than GM and Chrysler?
"You mean Ghosn?  He was facing faked charges but cleared, so they faked some more to keep him on the defensive and out of Nissan because they wanted him out and faking charges is how they made it happen.  Renault already cleared him.

It's too bad, Nissan was going bankrupt when Ghosn turned them around and made the company profitable."
"> VW might be too after that emissions scandal.

I actually think the emissions scandal will be what saves VW. Their sales and revenue have only gone up since the Scandal and it basically forced their hand into giving EVs a serious look."
"Tesla was founded by Eberhard and Tarpenning, not Musk. Musk was a major investor. From  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,\_Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.) :

&#x200B;

*Tesla Motors* was incorporated in July 2003 by [Martin Eberhard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Eberhard) and [Marc Tarpenning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Tarpenning) who financed the company until the [Series A round](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_A_round) of funding.[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.#cite_note-26) The founders were influenced to start the company after [GM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors) recalled all its [EV1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_EV1) electric cars in 2003 and then destroyed them.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.#cite_note-GM-27) Elon Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as its chairman.

&#x200B;

edit: Apparently Musk was retroactively given founder status? [https://www.tesla.com/elon-musk](https://www.tesla.com/elon-musk)"
">It is a private company

What company are you talking about?"
"I think Tesla would succeed without musk as well, but I think their current growth isn’t happening without Musk."
That sounds to me as if you were saying that Elon is actively sabotaging Tesla.
I really hope he is successful with that. Portland Oregon is considering a tunnel for some of its light rail line through the city center and I'm concerned cost is going to prevent it from happening despite it being pretty needed long term.
"While it gets almost no press coverage, his artificial intelligence research company [Neuralink](https://www.neuralink.com/) is also doing some incredible things.  If and when it starts a revenue stream, it will really make a splash and could be huge for consumer applications as well as military applications."
And Starlink and revolutionize the internet.
I just want another flamethrower tbh
And energy?
Good point!! They do the EV London taxi as well.
"People said that about Apple, and they're still a trillion dollar company without Jobs.

There's definite signs of slowdowns in their innovation since, but it hasn't hurt their stock price long term as of yet."
Yea... Having a company be one wrong tweet away from oblivion isn't very comforting.
"That, or being valued at 40+ billion dollars on mostly red quarters will do it."
"He was retroactively given founder status.  Check out Tesla's website biography

[https://www.tesla.com/elon-musk](https://www.tesla.com/elon-musk)"
"If you look up ""Tesla founders"" you see three faces, his included"
"In every example you give, branching out into multiple areas is what capitalized on early success.   Amazon runs the internet.  Apple is a telecom and music company.  Google has its fingers in everything.  Tesla supports national power grid infrastructures."
"Yup

 And don't forget software"
"Automation's in robotics software energy


And I agree 100% that's why a lot of people who place a value on all these different areas tend to value tesla much higher 500 or a $1000."
Not to be confused with Furd or Chrysla.
Maybe he meant [Tucker?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_48)
"I'm obviously talking about the future of FSD.

Is Tesla a battery company?
Is Tesla a software company?"
"really? Apple was the first company to surpass a market cap of $1 trillion, and is the most valuable company in the world, or second, depending on the day."
They became the first $1T company after he died.  They kept getting more valuable without him.
"When Jobs died in 2011, Apple had a market cap of about $330bn. Today their market cap is over $930bn. In 2011, they sold about 72 million iPhones. Last year they sold 217 million.

Yea, I think they’re doing alright after Jobs."
"But in the overall context, it's not even close. Ask 20 random people who Mary Barra is and I can't see any of them getting it right whereas I would think many would be able to tell you who Musk is."
"And she’s pretty damn sharp.  She’s led the push for EVs, bankrolled by profits from gas-guzzlers (which is a much better use of the money than stock buybacks or extra dividends).  She’s had them going full-bore on autonomous driving for years, too.

Contrast that with Ford, who’s just now getting on the EV/autonomy bandwagon — or Chrysler, whose product planners seem to think it’s still 1968 (they’re *imbeciles* and I think they’ll be gone in 6-8 years)."
"I'd consider myself an entry-level car guy, and I've never heard of her."
Have you met the current President of the United States?
He's right they both went bankrupt
"GM was founded in 2010.  Chrysler in 2014.  Tesla is older than both.  

A lot of people (you included) might think the old bankrupt companies are the same company as these current ones, but that's not true - and in fact it is a major crime to commit fraud like that.  The new ""GM"" and ""Chrysler"" are companies taht could have been naamed literally anything else, they chose old familiar names to give the appearance of being older than they are and it's OK because they bought the rights to those names from the defunct companies that no longer exist.

Delorean, likewise, is still around but it's not the same company as the original 80s one - they just bought the logos and name etc after John Delorean went bankrupt."
"The charges against him always were a little bit ""you've got a broken tail light \*smash\*"". There must have been some seriously weird political manouverings going on."
For all intents and purposes - he’s a founder. He became CEO during roadsters production and everything since.
Tesla themselves call Musk founder. But my point still stands.
"That's fair. I disagree but without a parallel universe where Musk is gone, we'll never know for sure :)"
Are they actually doing incredible things or just aspiring to?  I haven't seen any results yet.
"When Jobs died Apple was already established, they just need to keep milking the iPhone. Tesla is reaching that point. If the robo taxi thing comes to exist as they say then they're set for a long while and Musk can retire."
A lot of people said and still say Apple died with Steve Jobs. They are mostly riding on momentum atm.
"I agree with you. Get a process in place, constantly improve it, but stick to it."
"To be fair, many a wrong tweet has come and gone from Elon/Tesla ^((e.g. the debacle with the kids stuck in the cave), and they're still alive, growing and thriving. I definitely share your sentiment, but historic data suggests that as of yet no wrong tweet has every been able to kick them into oblivion, so it might not happen."
"Five actually.

J. B. Straubel and Ian Wright were also retroactively given founder status."
That's my point.
"Or the other big 'T', Tuyoter"
[deleted]
They fired Jobs early on and nearly went bankrupt. Jobs coming back is the sole reason Apple is around today. Only after much more time had passed was Apple able to survive. There was also likely plenty of work done so a repeat didn’t happen.
Everyone always forgets the first time he left. Apple was broke and he saved them on his own. Apple would be history without Jobs.
"I’d assume though that Musk is more recognisable for the SpaceX stuff than the Tesla stuff. It’s like talking about Boring Machines, and saying that ‘nobody knows who the other tunneling company CEOs are other than Elon Musk’."
But this is quite new too. I used to have conversations with people who had no idea who elon is now hes gotten more into mainstream knowledge here in Germany
"> (they’re imbeciles and I think they’ll be gone in 6-8 years).

There were some rumblings a month ago of FCA merging with Renault, but that fell apart pretty quickly. I wouldn't be surprised to see something along those lines happen though. FCA is interesting. They have some really successful cars like the Jeep Wrangler or Ram Truck, but the bulk of their cars are total garbage like the Chrysler 200."
"She took over from Bob Lutz who also bought in huge into EVs and the Chevy Volt.  While not perfect, that was one of the few product lines that survived the bankruptcy of GM.

You also need to give some kudos to Martin Eberhard who had the balls to drive a on engineering prototype to the GM headquarters and show off the car to the top brass at GM.  That was the spark at GM which pushed the company back to electric vehicles after the disaster of EV-1 and to treat that part of the auto market seriously.

Too bad that GM didn't treat EV-1 seriously nor try to realistically market that car."
"You know FCA is doing very right well now trying to keep up with demand for Jeeps and Rams. They're building a new assembly plant in Detroit right now because they don't have capacity. 1st new plant in the city since they demolished half of Hamtramck for the ""Poletown"" plant that is currently winding down production because GM can't find a product for it."
"> or Chrysler, whose product planners seem to think it’s still 1968 (they’re imbeciles and I think they’ll be gone in 6-8 years).

To be fair it seems that Chrysler has been in rebuilding mode for the past decade. Most of their cars sit on old platforms that get updates here and there for maximum cost-cutting. They seem to only put money towards developing their cash cows Jeep and RAM."
"Good, I'm tired of seeing people in Chrysler 300s trying to tailgate and stunt like it's the new Impala/Caprice.

Nothing more annoying than someone driving a toy that thinks they're Mad Max."
She is a token to SJW
"Isn't it still the same company though? They changed owners but it's still the same designs, same tech, same people, same facilities, same everything."
"When they go bankrupt, Tesla goes bankwupt"
"Ehhhhh.....

Great attention to detail, and I could totally see this being an awesome pub trivial question! For day-to-day use, I don't think it's a fair equivalence. It's not just the marks and names that were bought; for all practical purposes they are the same companies with the same suppliers and the same production lines and the same design legacy. Even from a nitpicking legal perspective, no one would normally refer to re-incorporating from an S Corp into a C Corp as a new company."
"Maybe from a lawyer's desk or a trader's desk they're not the same companies, but effectively they're the same companies. The people, the IP, the trademarks, the facilities, and others were all retained. The company's DNA remained the same. This was purely a shift of assets, debts, etc. on paper.

&#x200B;

If that's what defines a ""company"" to you, that's your opinion.

&#x200B;

I disagree however. My dad worked for GM before, during and after the Chap 11/TARP reorganization, and it basically all happened in corporate and lawyers' offices in Detroit and DC. Not much on the floor of the factories or the halls of GMTC in Warren changed during that time. Hell, the assembly plant that my dad worked with the most continued building cars over the first weeks of July in 2009 when the ""old GM"" was died and replaced by the ""new GM.""

"> That's fair. I disagree but without a parallel universe where Musk is gone, we'll never know for sure :)

We did have a parallel universe. It was called Fisker. If that wasn't enough, turns out there are more parallel universes. Faraday Future."
"They have enough people that hardware is being made and code is being written.  It is definitely at the ""bending metal"" stage, but otherwise not anything that can be used for viable applications.  If I had to compare it to rocketry, they are sort of at the Robert Goddard phase of development and still trying to understand the basic principles of the technology they are trying to work with.  Inventing formulas to explain how stuff works and doing stuff that literally nobody else has ever done.

Some published scientific papers have been written, and it seems to be the source of some of Elon Musk's trepidation about AI.  Is that result useful?  I also don't know how much they are working with the Tesla autopilot team but it seems like something that might have some synergy.  It is also pretty obvious why that link might be downplayed too."
"When Jobs was fired Apple was well established.  Apple also collapsed with bean counters taking over the company.

The return of Steve Jobs is simply legendary in business history and how he turned a tech company of minor profit and flat sales into a large company with startup style growth.  Steve Jobs also fired the bean counters."
[deleted]
"It's also why shorts tend to lose their shit.  Apple, Amazon, Tesla - all massively shorted by people that say things like ""Amazon is way overvalued for an internet book company"" and if they acknowledge more than that it's still just thinking they're an internet retailer.  The majority of market manipulators have a vested interest in not understanding how valuable owning multiple industries can be.  I see Tesla Energy being their primary profit maker in 50 years.  Or I hope so anyway, I won't be around in 50 years unless Neuralink lets me upload my consciousness."
">No they don't make batteries.

Tesla absolutely makes batteries.  What they currently don't make are cells since Panasonic is the primary supplier for that component.

Batteries are formally what gets made when you assemble multiple cells into one unit, which very clearly defines the battery packs that Tesla makes.  The term was coined by Benjamin Franklin since it reminded him of a battery of artillery when multiple Leyden jar cells were put together in series.

Yes, the same Benjamin Franklin who invented the term ""two bagger"" and helped draft the US Declaration of Independence.

We will see if thanks to Maxwell that Tesla will get into cell production.  It is very possible too."
ok boss
"He ""left"" because he was kicked out after almost running Apple into the ground.  His successor saved the company.

Meanwhile, Jobs learned how to be a better CEO."
"I actually assume the opposite. Much to my chagrin, most of the public doesn't care about space stuff. They probably heard about the Falcon Heavy, but likely don't know what a Falcon 9 is. On the other hand, people see Teslas on the road every day (well, okay, maybe not even most people, but you get my point). Which company gets more news coverage? Probably Tesla. Or at least, those are the articles people actually read. Who reads SpaceX articles?"
I had heard Hyundai Kia was considering a hostile takeover but that also seems to have fallen by the wayside
So many people pointed at this merger as proof that Tesla was dead
"Luckily for Chrysler, their best sellers have the highest margins."
"At this point, I'm glad they didn't.  Musk stated that was part of the reason he got involved with Tesla., IIRC."
"That’s true, but again, the next 6-8 years will likely not be kind to them.  They’re far too reliant on gas guzzlers."
"She’s no such thing and their executive team is full of women, including the cfo. Barra has been a competent leader for GM and one of the more forward looking ones."

"Nope, it's actually illegal for it to be the same company, that's why it's illegal   for them to have a CEO for longer than Tesla has had Elon.

I don't see how you can say ""for all practical purposes"" or ""from a nitpicking legal perspective"" either one and ignore that they don't treat pre 2010 cars as made by the same company."

&#x200B;

edit: i wanted to add that it's not so much as we don't care about space stuff, it's just not as direct towards our everyday lives as cars that we need to drive on a daily basis. plus we'll only really be able to experience the benefits of space exploration on the magnitude of decades rather than a few years for EVs"

"Not how it works. The entire point of a satellite constellation is that of putting up mass amounts of commodity satellites into low earth orbit instead of utilising satellites in stationary geosynchronous orbits.

These are not geosynchronous satellites that will remain above a stationary location on the earth's surface - rather there will be dozens of satellites repeatedly travelling overhead over the course of a day. There will not be singular solitary stationary satellites available to purchase.

However in terms of your main point what can happen instead is that such a village could purchase the standard phased array antenna basestation to obtain access to the satellite constellation for a few hundred dollars like any other enduser, and then hook it up to use it as either the backhaul link for a cell tower or as the main hub for a fibreoptic or fixed wireless network for their local area."

"Orwellian Newspeak as it is, I could see that happening again when autonomy/EVs become fully dominant. Old GM and Middle GM would be gas and diesel cars only and New New GM could be for EVs.

GM the Third
">when you go lower on the org chart is it not the same people making the same cars?

That is sort of true, but everybody had to get rehired and go through the application process.  New contracts were negotiated with the labor unions and about the only thing that remained was the remaining tooling.

In that sense, legally they did start over again from zero.  The new company got the assets, the trademarks, and engineering documents.  Seniority also got reset completely for places where that matters."
"The answer to your question is still ""No.""  

/u/dhanson865 [explains it to you thoroughly here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/cb380t/teslas_tsla_elon_musk_is_currently_the_auto/etd5ky3/).  The new company that calls itself New GM says in its own words that it  unequivocally is not the old GM.  

Following up with your question of rehiring - any executives that had sufficient power at old GM to require SEC filings could not be rehired by the new company without risking prison time.  The SEC exists to stop market manipulation tactics like that.  As I said above, if it was possible it would happen constantly.

TLDR:  If you're an employee that can buy stock whenever you feel like it, you can be hired by the new company no problem.  If you had to file your every stock buy and sell with SEC insider trading compliance forms etc, you weren't getting rehired by the new company."
"It is essentially a technicality but legally a very important technicality. 

&#x200B;

No one sees ""New GM"" and ""Old GM"", it is just on the books as so."
"I agree that the GP didn't cover bankruptcy properly and that there are several forms of bankruptcy where the CEO can remain.

The old GM, on the other hand, had its stock price go to zero and had negative equity (more debt than assets).  That included quite a bit of the UAW (United Auto Workers) pension fund which had invested in GM as well, at least for several locals.  In the reconstituted company, the UAW got some shares and the new company took over assets at pennies to the dollar.

The Obama administration did much of the negotiation between the UAW, creditors, and the bankruptcy trustees over what to do with the company since it was seen that dissolving GM completely would cause significant harm to the country as a whole.  Some capital in the new company even came from discretionary funds in the Executive Branch of the federal government.  It was for this reason the new GM for a time was called ""Government Motors"".  Taxpayers were reimbursed after the new GM IPO, which was one of the largest in history and technically the Obama administration made a profit from that transaction too.  To say that was controversial is an understatement."
"Take your narrative back to the ""real"" tesla echo chamber"
">  rather there will be dozens of satellites 

Thousands.  Tens of thousands.  Starlink's first round of testing is going to have 420 satellites, and it isn't even the only satellite constellation provider doing this, they're launching Iridium for a similar purpose and a third company is talking about suing Starlink for ""stealing their idea""

The goal is to have at least a few dozens of satellites over your head at any given second for low latency high speeed data anywhere on earth.

And he's right, this won't be rolled out to cities first - it will be offered to less developed areas where infrastructure is lacking.  That way they won't saturate the uplinks immediately as they build the system to be robust."
"Sorry my words were not specific. I know how it works I meant they can buy a satellite dish, reciever. Maybe I'm not using the correct word"
"A great historical example of this is Porsche's hostile takeover of VW.  They overextended the company to make it happen and VW was able to turn the tables and gain control of Porsche.  

To make it relevant to this sub, the VW buyout burned VW's short sellers worse than any short burn in history.  VW was the most valuable company on the planet briely, because short sellers were forced to cover at any price and share availability was limited due to the buyout.  Porsche could set any price they wanted so the short burn was third degree."
GM3
Just another way they scammed America
"Thanks, was wondering where that boundary is. I see now why the new company wouldn't have the same CEO.

Although, if we go back to the actual cars, there's still a point to be made there. CEOs don't make cars, their companies do. I wonder how much of GM actually changed when it went bankrupt given that the new owner kept it running."
"I'm aware of the whole changeover with GM. That was a *very* unique situation, where OP was talking about bankruptcies in general."
"I agree it is stupid to not consider GMs old work, and I assume that guy was just making a point on the selective use of the term. But you seem to be following an ideology, have fun with that."
"You've misread the post and taken that quote out of context. To reiterate:

>rather there will be dozens of satellites repeatedly travelling overhead over the course of a day.

This is not a reference to the total number of satellites in the constellation - that figure is irrelevant to a given location. Only those which will cross into line of sight of a particular location within a particular time period matter in this regard, and this is only in reference to Starlink.

As in, directly within view of/overhead a given location on earth (other than the poles where the numbers will be more limited). That upon initial constellation deployment within the first few years there will be dozens coming into line of sight of any location each day.

While NA/Canada service is intended to initially be activated with only a few hundred deployed, and globally with a few hundred more after that the first phase of deployment is much higher at 1584 satellites. 66 per each of the 24 orbital planes.

At most 3 planes could be in line of site of a given location, and even then not all will be within an angular range which allows for their usage. Also each will have only a few within each plane in their line of site at any given point in time.

The FCC requirements essentially mandate that they must continue lofting satellites up as fast as they can build them in order to be allowed to continue to fill out the full constellation size, or lose the ability to do so. While there will of course be testing, it will not only be a small testing batch.

As these are not geosynchronous satellites purchasing one would make zero sense and will not occur. Purchasing access to the network as an enduser via mass produced hardware - most likely the phased array antenna combined in an all-in-one unit with a modem/router equivalent currently referred to as the pizza box is what will occur.

As to who will be able to purchase service first, that is far more likely to be the commercial arrangements than anything else - antennas being fit to aeroplane fleets for instance, and quite possibly providing backhaul links for telecom company cell towers before anything else. 

Only eventually expanding to regional/rural endusers after that as the constellation is progressively filled out. With global expansion following much the same path country by country as the higher capacity primary basestations are set up at major peering points.

Even with the current rate of satellite builds being aimed to be ramped up to ~1k a year, that effectively maxes out at the full ~4400 LEO constellation size alone.

The additional ~7500 VLEO satellites come much later, most likely not until after Starship/Superheavy are the platform launching the sats. They have until 2024 to put half the satellites up, and 2027 until all must be launched."
"For this network it will be using a phased array antenna rather than a satellite dish so that would be a better term to use but satellite receiver would work too.

Though there's no need to apologise, the main point you were making/intending to make was completely accurate.

Get one of the phased array antenna units and you don't need a physical backhaul link for internet. Add a solar array or wind turbine to it and you don't need a power grid connection."
Here's hoping that the inevitable Tesla short burn makes the VW burn look like a birthday candle!

#TeamBlack
That reflected light on the hood made me think it was a Porsche badge for half a second! Looks great!
What’s the percentage of tint on that? Looking to tint mine as well. Basically started thinking about it today. I know nothing about the subject.
"Damn, bet no cops would see her if you turn off the lights and regen at night."
When I was young I had a black Mazda 6 with gunmetal wheels and tinted all black. This reminds me so much of it! I like it! Congrats on the good looks!
Wow!
Smart man paint matching the handles. I keep seeing black cars with satin black handles and they look out of place. Car looks awesome btw. Pretty much identical to mine as it sits right now.
also got mine deleted last week..i think it looks so much better... what kind of tape did you use?
fire
 DIY or did a shop do it? I’ve been curious about doing exactly the same but don’t want to spend a ton on it either
Epic
Amazing— soon Ill have one. Not soon enough though
"The reflection of the yellow light on the hood makes it look like a porche at first glance...

Other than that, that is HOTT. makes me want to do more to modify my LR3"
Looks FANTASTIC!!!!
Now all you need are night vision goggles and you can run down desert roads going 155 🤔
"Looks fantastic! I did the same on my Model 3.

I got 70% on front, I'm in Quebec so that's the rule :), and 50% everywhere else. Back window is one piece to the top.

I also did the chrome delete.

Work was done at Precision PPF in Ottawa.

\-R

Edit: I'd add a photo but I don't know how to do that as a comment LOL"
🙌
Thanks! I’ve really liked having the badges blacked out.
I got 20% on front and back windows. I wanted it pretty dark and even across the car.
Activate stealth mode
"There is no way to turn of DRL though, right?"
Thanks! Much appreciated. I've always loved blacked out cars.
"Yeah, I much prefer the gloss black vinyl on the handles for the black Model 3. I think satin works great on non-black cars, but it looks a bit off on black."
I went with satin black vinyl wrap on the window trim and mirror. Plastidipped the emblems. And put gloss black vinyl on the door handles to blend with the paint.
"I wasn’t brave enough to do it myself. Ended up going to three different shops, one for tint, one for plastidip and one for vinyl wrap. Ended up costing around $800 in total."
They are on my wishlist! Haha
Are you worried about being pulled over? I want 20% as well looks great!
Is yours wrapped all the way? Even the back of the handle?
Does the gloss black vinyl on the handles blend nicely with the paint? Did you wrap the side cameras in gloss black also? I was about to pull the trigger on wrapping all the bits on my black M3 in satin black but now you have me thinking.
"Not bad if it’s good heat resistant tint! I’ll probably start shopping around SoCal in a couple weeks, yours looks just beautiful!"
"Even if you go 35%, it’s pretty obvious and you can get pulled over just as easy imo."
"I had a similar tint on my previous car.  Drove it for about six years and never got pulled over.  At the end of the day, I knew I wouldn't of been happy if I went lighter and had to look at it everyday. But some people like to have the piece of mind knowing it's all legal."
"No, it’s just the face of the handle."
It blends perfectly.  Very similar to the stock black paint color of the Model 3.  I actually had the side cameras plastidipped along with the badges on the front and back.
Great! Let me know if you need any recommendations. I live in east LA.
How much did the tint cost in east LA?
I know you live in East LA. But I went to Top Tint / Templar Wraps here in Santa Ana. And they did a tint for me. All four. One single sheet for the back windshield for $350!
$250-$350 for the four doors. Around $250-$300 more if you want to do the entire back windshield.
Not bad pricing. I guess 2 day turnaround?
Is it possible that you can provide the details of the shops? Would love to get the back windshield done for this price!
"They were actually able to do it by the end of the day.  Dropped it off around 10am, picked it up at 4pm."
Mine was demo too Saved $11k. Great job and congrats!!!!  Dope color ✊🏽
Why didn’t they use summon to unload it?

Anyway, congrats!"
"How did you get a demo model? I’m hoping to do the same, as new prices are a bit steep for me."
wow! that's amazing!!
r/gifsthatendtoosoon/
What is a \*demo\* Model 3?
Wow great discount! How many miles did it have when you bought it?
Summon definitely wouldn't work in a steep situation like that.
No doubt. Hahah
That was my first thought!
Perfect condition with about 300kms on it. Barely any discount though.
Just asked if they’d sell it to me. It seriously didn’t save me that much though. I’m guessing it’s a discount of .50 cents per km. lol. Only benefit was getting it in 2 days.
It was used for test drives at the sales centre.
He most likely got extra bonuses but when I inquired about that at a Maryland Tesla store they said 1 dollar per mile
It had 197X miles on it.
Not a bad benefit though. The mileage on it is so low that it's still a good deal. Do you know when this was manufactured by any chance? Did it come with EAP or FSD?
"Aren't ""extra bonuses"" forbidden on corporate level?"
[deleted]
"197 or 197,000?"
"I don’t know what those codes stand for, but it was manufactured in April 2019."
"Don't think so because I have heard people getting comped all kinds of stuff. Discount here for this issue, scuff here scuff there = certain amounts off. That is what I was getting at. It's not really the same but I got comped a 1000 dollar delivery fee because I bought a Model 3 online in Colorado and didn't realize there was a fee if it was over 500 miles away. If you call a store or talk to your rep if you started the process at a store they will get their managers to call regional and that's how I got it waived. Wasn't any hassle either. Maybe it was just miles comped but if it was a demo driven for that many hard as heck miles I would want more then 11k off lol"
"I'd gladly take a Model 3 for $11k less with only 2k miles on it, and even get it delivered in 2 days. That's a great deal!"
I got a new car interest rate.
Yeah my demo only had 30 miles on it. Saved almost 10k. Op definitely bought used.
"A little under 2,000 miles.

x was the 4th digit. So between 1970 and 1979."
"wondered the same but 197,000 would be 197k, not 197x"
Oops sorry. Did it come with Autopilot or Full Self Driving?
There’s no way you got a 10k discount for a demo with 30 miles on it lol
Correct
Autopilot and AWD
"K, I paid $42,500 for a RED RWD LR, 19"" wheels and AP, the end of March. It was a 2018 demo and had 30 miles on it."
I thought Canada was 1.5$ per km on demo cars?
I guess I missed out on that deal. :(

"I also own one in Texas. As long as you live in Dallas, Houston, Austin you are OK. Outside that..... difficult. Maybe San Antonio could work.

Also depends on how you use car. Mine (M3) is just for commuting and charges at home each night (mid range). My wife’s is for road trips (long range) and super charger network will get us anywhere (except big bend) we want to go. Luckily we don’t have any family far from a supercharger...."
I’m in the north Dallas area and pretty much everyone I work with is a good ole country boy so I was nervous about what kind of comments i would get but it was actually a huge hit. I’ve still got guys asking to test drive it and the end of August will be a year of ownership!
Moooooooooo
I’m getting mine next May.  I’m in central Texas about 45 mins from fort hood.  There’s no Tesla’s in my town and u rarely see other ev’s.  A few private charging stations.  My family’s worried about people purposely damaging  my car when I get it.

How did my car get to Texas!!
How does the blue hold up to dirt and swirl marks?? I'm on the fence between white or blue
Put a burnt orange wrap on it and some longhorns on the hood.
"North San Antonio here.  I mostly charge at home but have used the EV parking at the airport.  Also, there is free charging at The Pearl."

Dual Motor MSM here in Frisco/Plano area. Tesla’s are everywhere.
"Performance Model 3 in San Antonio here. Got a ceramic paint sealant applied and may tint the side windows but overall it's working great. Car handles the heat very well. I'm also installing a 14-50 in the garage this week but there's chargers all over the city, lots of options with a charging adapter.

I'm about 8 miles from the service center so the mobile ranger will come to my house as well if needed."
It should be a red one park next to the bull. That will be funnier. 😂

Try living in Manhattan and having to go to Brooklyn during rush hour for service.  Lol
Technically I purchased it in California and transferred it to Texas
There’s a super charger at El Cosmico in Marfa
Congrats on your year! It’s one of those cars that people just want to learn more about. Even those that initially make fun still end up asking about it and wanting to learn more.
"Most people probably won't realize what it is. Those who do will probably be excited and ask you the same basic questions every non-EV owner asks.

Throw a 500GB SSD in the center console and turn Sentry on. It's great to have that peace of mind."
"I’ve taken my Tesla to some off the map texas cities. People look at you curiously and a lot are very excited to see it. 

Unfortunately assholes live everywhere so there’s always a risk of someone being petty. SSD and sentry mode will at least help you identify the scum that mess with it"
"Slap a ""Made in America"" sticker on there if you start getting nervous."
"It’s pretty good. My blue had swirl marks from day one. Tesla has stated they can repaint the whole car but I think that’s gonna do my harm than good. 

Overall the blue is fantastic. A darker color will always look dirtier faster than a lighter color. The blue really stands out though. It makes the car more unique and really pops in the sun rather than being just another boring color sedan (personal opinion)"
"Um, actually that would need be purple with some horny toads on it.  C’mon man."
I put a clear tint film on it so it blocks additional UV rays and heat. Honestly it’s not bad even without it. They did a pretty good job. But if you’re concerned get some tint on it or buy the sunscreen from Tesla
"I have tint on top and even with it, it would get pretty hot on road trips. Ended up buying a shade for the top and that has helped quite a bit."
Performance Model 3 here in the Murphy/Sachse/Wylie area.  Agreed - I see Model 3's on the road almost daily.
"I drive about 50 miles weekdays and 100+ miles on the weekends all over DFW and have saved about $2,000 in gas so far!"
Austin supercharger is no joke.  It was so busy when I was visiting.  They need like 2 more locations at least.
FW here too. Only 2 trips to the Dalas center was to pick up the car and then another day to get the minor issues I found resolved.
I've been unlucky.  The stuff I had go wrong early on required a trip to the shop.
Service centers is the LEAST of Alabama's problems.   :).  From my house to Dallas is about an hour + traffic.
I'm gonna say noooooooo.   :)
That is just so dumb...sorry you have to deal with that
"Neat, thanks :)"
did you save on sales tax?
Yes they do!! A couple guys had me come out to the parking lot to open it up for them and my director ended up coming outside to look too. This was roughly a week after he went on a rant about how ICE vehicles are still the way of the future and it doesn’t make sense for anyone to own electric (insert eye roll).
How do you use a 500gb Ssd if the Tesla only supports FAT32? Just curious. Thanks

"It's worse for some other EVs. If I wanted a Kia or a Chevy Bolt... I'd have to drive to Oregon, purchase it there, and then drive it back to Idaho. At least Tesla delivered to my house. That was a nice bonus."
Nope. You pay taxes wherever the car ends up being registered. So I paid normal texas taxes

"2 bucket car wash would definitely help prevent swirl marks if you wash your TM3 yourself. Blue is just a great color but gotta keep it clean! For light dust and dirt, I use Aero Cosmetics wash/wax no rinse. No swirl marks and get to wash car inside the garage. Ceramic coating truly helps as well."
I had one instance where water gathered up underneath a noise baffling thing underneath the car.  That baffling ripped and was dragging the ground making a hell of a noise.

Bingo.

I use [GUIformat](http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm) for my SSD.  I'm a high mileage driver and 500GB will last me a little over a month with DashCam and Sentry running full time other than in my garage."

"Yup. Almost had that happen to me. Bolts were backing out on that panel. I should have let service replace the panels, since the new ones are more robust... But locktite has held up nicely.

"I've luckily never needed anything beyond the front collision audio warning but it's nice to know the car can perform so effortlessly in some of these other situations, some of which are honestly very impressive to me."

"I'd be curious to know what the driver is doing for these. Is the driver also attempting to stop, or are they intentionally oblivious?"
Serious question: how many vehicles does an automaker provide for this series of tests?
Can you limit the top speed via your phone for these cars?  I could see this being almost the required car to own if you're under 25 years old (if only it were cheaper).
"Something to note in all of these tests is the car comes to a complete stop when a bike or pedestrian is encountered. I’ve seen a lot of cases (including myself) where a human slows down but does not stop. There is just that psychological idea that I shouldn’t have to stop if I’m in the right. However, it is dangerous because a bike or pedestrian is likely to be followed by another. I have heard of and seen a lot of low speed accidents which could of easily been avoided by coming to a complete stop instead of just slowing down to avoid an immediate collision."
It's good to know that if some weird puppet thing on a trolley pulls out in front of me then my Tesla's got my back.
Yes they provide these kinds of safety features regardless of if you’ve purchased any additional software.
Yes
yes but in mph instead of km/h :)
I think they try to crash but idk
Yes you can limit top speed but not sure if from mobile app or only from car. You can lock it too.
Hopefully no one is following the Tesla in those situations.
Awesome thank you. :)
"It's cool, it's another Tesla."
