"That's a really good idea. I'd hate to see some well-intentioned good Samaritan break a window to ""save"" a dog that's perfectly safe and comfortable. "
No picture of the dog?~!
"This dog lives a better life than I do. 

Dogs just chillin, probably listening to Spotify as it sets destination to its favorite park, using its paws to pinch zoom on that huge screen. Maybe a little nap while autopilot 2.0 drives it to the park. "
Is this in Melbourne? I'm pretty sure I have seen that car around my local shopping centre. 
But is his favorite song playing???
My parents have two laminated cards that say about that same thing for their two dogs that are occasionally left in their Tesla. A fireman found my mom walking back to the car once and mentioned that the card saved her windows because he was about the smash it in to save the dogs.
You better not leave it with the AC on for too long. You don't want to have to walk all the way to the gas station and back to get a can of electricity.
"Whilst cool, just be aware that in places that have legislation about dogs in cars, they don't give a shit if your aircon is on. the law is about the external temp and dog being locked in the vehicle.

you can be fined and the police can smash your window to 'rescue'. whether your remotely ""monitoring"" the dog or not."
"""But your lights are still on."""
"so, now I'm looking forward to the day I can sit in a cafe and wait for a crowd of concerned citizens to gather around meh Tesla while my dog is in it, and then tell the car to drive itself around the block."

Doesn't it turn off after a while if the key's not present and/or there's no weight in the driver's seat?  I've had human passengers complain that everything shut off when I left them alone.

I would never let a dog in my Tesla. Just saying.

"How low tech is this though? I mean, why didn't Elon invent synthetic telepathy and user that to warn people. A piece of paper with words on it is so primitive."
This is great but where is the photo of the puppers in the Tesla?
"Break the window, and leave a note 'sorry i cant read english, but i can write it, i saw your dog in there and had to save him'"
"Is there a dog-in-car mode or does one just manually set the AC on?

Would maybe be cool to have a connected collar which talks to the car when the dog is in the car and relays that dog's optimal operating temperature (husky vs labrador say). That means automatic enabling of AC, less hassle, no forgetting and could even notify you if you've left them too long!"
"I don't know anything about electric cars, does this mean the car is running?  Is this an invitation to steal the car?"
"I saw one of these too! Guy had his dog in the car and mentioned that the AC was on, and the dog had water. He also left his phone number just in-case, which I thought was pretty cool. "
May need to put a thermometer next to the paper so more people believe you and don't just think it's a note you long stopped following yourself but we too lazy to remove from the dash
Still a bad idea. Don't leave pets or kids in the car.

Why does it being electric matter? You can't hear that it's on or something?
It's a damn shame that this is necessary. But a very good idea to be proactive. 
I dunno the dog still looks a little distressed. Better break the window just in case

"This is exactly what I was thinking of doing when I got my Tesla..   that I'd need a note like this..

Perhaps a cheapo thermometer would further bore would-be window breakers 
"The somewhat annoyingly frightening thing is though, I know people who would tell themselves that it literally doesn't matter that the AC was on and would still shatter the window thinking they were in the right.

You know, those people who feel like they have to advertise how much they love animals, and prioritize showcasing their compassion over common sense."

I'd freak the fuck out if I caught someone breaking my window for any reason.

"""Don't break the window it's fucking cold out there goddamnit you broke the window now I'm cold you dick"""
"[7] Imagine seeing a dog in a car on a hot day, mustering up the courage and self righteousness to break someone's car window to free it and then immediately feeling the cool air from the a/c wash over your face:

*oh, um, oh, um, oh, um, um, um, um, uh, oh, oh, um.... uh, oh, oh, oh god, oh my god* "
There's rules for that.  Police and attempts to contact owner must be met first and there has to be an obvious immediate endangerment or the Good Samaritan will have to pay for new Tesla glass.
A good samaritan would probably break the window and save that camera lying around the car thanks to the genius idea to tell everyone that talks pass by the car that there are things they can steal
"I'd rather have a dead dog in there than deal with a broken window. Then again, why put a dog in a Tesla to begin with? That's what the frunk is for."
"The dog would be safe and comfortable AT HOME WHERE HE BELONGS.   Unless you are transporting your dog to the vet in a kennel, then having them loose in the car is a danger to them and you if you're in an accident, the dog can fly and hit you, or be injured when he hits some part of the interior or goes flying out.

Also, by default most cars are set to recirculate the air inside the cabin and bring in little to no outside air  (particularly if you're parked.  After a few minutes, the oxygen level is going to be very low inside the car, and the carbon dioxide level very high.   So great, you've made the dog motion sick by driving him around, then you give him brain damage because of being oxygen deprived.  All because you're got a mental disorder that you think your puppers wants to go for a ride, then sit in the car by himself.

Driving your dog is no substitute for WALKING your dog.  

Yeah, it would be ashame for someone to smash that smug bastard's window."

I was working in a hardware store last summer where a woman in a tesla ordered some multiplex. She was dead serious about transporting them in her car. We pretty much begged her not to because it would have ruined the interior. After much back and forth she decided to call her husband and have him come over with his van. The look on his face when we told what almost happened was priceless. Thanked us profusely and I can only imagine what he said to his wife once they got home.

I think some Tesla's always have the AC on when the car is off on order to maintain it at a perfect temperature for when you come back. 
Still locked and you can't drive it anywhere.
Why would leaving the dog in the car be worse than leaving the dog at home?
Right so let's just leave a dying child or dog to die from oven hot temperatures. 
"If you leave a pet or child in a hot car, fuck your business, it's getting broken into."
the air fan can run for hours without an engine running
It's quiet. People may assume that it's not on because they can't hear engine noise. 
Because bragging.
Why is it a shame? Dogs being left in hot cars is a real problem and most people wouldn't know that a Tesla can keep itself cool while turned off.
The same thing that would happen if a person that lives alone and has a dog had an accident; there's a potential for something to go wrong in virtually any scenario. 
What?
It is still illegal to leave a pet unattended in a car here in Oz
Teslas can run the AC for several days straight before battery life becomes a concern. 
That is true for internal conbustion engines.

Yeah you can set the temperature to whatever you want whenever you want. There is really no starting the car since it's all electric...although if you wanted to start the car using the app you could. Not to mention you can drive the car using the app as well without you even being in the car (it will only go like 3 mph and won't go more then like 50ft but it's still really cool to freak people out)

If it's 60 and cloudy, my dog is fine in the car for a good hour or more with everything closed. Probably longer, but I'm never gone that long.

If it's 75 and partly cloudy, he's fine with the windows cracked or sunroof partially open for the same time. 

If it's 90+ and sunny, he stays home in the A/C. 

It all depends on any given day and I have yet to kill or injure or even inconvenience my dog with my car in the five years I've had him even living everywhere from California to the Midwest. I think I know what I'm doing without the need for a snarky note."

"Hopefully you wouldn't lock a kid or pet (or realistic old lady mannequin) in a car on a hot or freezing day.

"Well it's a combination of a few things.

1. ""This is why we can't have nice things."" - Kids and dogs die every year by the dozens (at least) due to being left in hot cars. It's horrific. People are stupid.
2. Laws are based on quantifiable things - The door is either locked or it's not, and the temperature is a quantifiable thing. Whether or not the air conditioning is on, or is sufficient enough, or will continue to run indefinitely.... these are all grey area things that the law has trouble with."

Hello Alaskan.
I have it set to always connected. I've noticed the times it doesn't respond is usually on days I have the car plugged in but not always though. Also on days when it won't respond it usually won't auto present my door handles either it almost seems like it's just powered off or trying to process something. 
They have both options. The latest cars have an always on lte connection. It's free unlimited data currently but only time will tell if they start charging.
"They supposedly have a big update coming soon. Honestly though, the app does what it needs to even if it's not the most cutting edge ui. "
Haha I just turned the heater on. The 72° is the target temp and the 34° was the current temp inside the car.
I turned the heater on just to take the screenshot for you guys. The lower temp is the current cabin temp and the higher temp is the target temp. It's so far of because it was really cold outside and the heater had just come on.
You're right...my car iced over yesterday and the door handles didn't pop out like they usually do. I had to bang away the ice before I could get in the car. Then while in the car I realized my auto closing side mirrors were frozen closed. 
I'll buy a new access point and place it in the garage. I had Wi-Fi setup but it was 1 tiny little bar of service and that was giving me problems.

"If you see a car with a dog locked inside on a hot day call the police or animal control. Don't break a window.

In some states if someone saw you breaking a window it would be legal to shoot you. 

You don't mess with people's property. You mind your own business. You (presumably) pay taxes to support a bloated police force. Let them do their job.

Again, you shouldn't ever mess with someone's else's property. Dogs count as property in many states. As they should in all states.

How is exterior temperature quantifiable while interior temperature is not? I bet in most cases the temperature inside a car varies less that the temperature outside.
"> Laws are based on quantifiable things

If only... Most laws are ambiguous and you need to debate in court whether or not a law applies to your case and to what degree. The US has millions of lawyers because of this. I think you're confusing *regulations* which are detailed and precise most of the time."
"I fail to see how ""internal temperature"" would be a grey area.

At least not more than ""external temperature"" which can very between on the sun, in the shadows, and between perceived and real due to wind.

To me it seems like they just didn't properly updated the law as technology moved forward and air conditionning with interior temperature control became a thing :)

It's a Tesla. You need the key inside of the car for it to allow you to drive it (or you can use remote start on the app). It isn't hotwirable because it 'turns on' in software - not by turning over a starter motor.
Lol nah.
A law passed in ca gave civilians the right to break windows if they suspect an animal is in danger.
"While it's possible to sleep with the AC on while charging, it's considered impolite to do so at busy supercharger stations because those slots are meant for charging, not parking.  Tesla is about to instate a few for taking up slots when not charging.

If you're not charging and leave the AC on for 8 hours, you will lose a certain amount of range from your battery pack for that charge, but nowhere near a whole battery's worth.

They have had car starters on keys for years...
Honestly I forget I even have the feature. The car can learn your habits and it now starts to warm up my car when I wake up. When I'm at the mall or something I forget all about it until I jump into my car and it's freezing. It's a great feature if you think to use it though.
Just as a heads up they have remote start systems you can add on to any car that lets you start it from your phone or just from a remote on your keychain. 
Bro do you not have a heated garage? Pleeb.
"Essentially, yes. It's becoming more like an rc car with auto pilot 2.0 too. Eventually you'll be able to summon your car anywhere in the county. Take a fight to Florida and tell your car to drive to your hotel and it will eventually make it there."
"[What they're talking about is called summon, Here's an official demonstration from Tesla. It's designed to enter and exit garages.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQuJ8GKTjFM) You can't steer it, so no, It's not like an RC car, it steers itself in order to drive into the garage, while avoiding any obstacles on the way and not getting too close to the garage wall in the process.

It's basically a feature that's there to make the car exit and enter the garage all by itself, closing and opening the garage door autonomously in the process and avoiding obstacles. You can start summon even when the car is not inside or near a garage, but as a result it will only go forwards or backwards (your choice) at a low speed, while avoiding obstacles and braking if it detects that it's getting too close to something.

[When autopilot 2.0 gets updated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUw_DMaQ264), it will be able to [navigate complex enviroments](https://www.tesla.com/tesla_theme/assets/img/features/autopilot/section-smart_summon.jpg?20161101) in order to find the garage entrance, and park there.

More info about that [here](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot)."

">In some states if someone saw you breaking a window it would be legal to shoot you. At the very least I would tackle you.

In some states like Wisconsin, Tennesse, Florida, Ohio, Maine (to a degree), you're breaking the law leaving an animal unattended in the heat (actually that's at least 22 states), and in those states they have a legal right to break your car window.

So while you may think you have a right to shoot them, they actually break no laws and you have committed several felonies if not murder...

Know the law.  They may have every right to break your car window, and then have you arrested for assault if you tackled them.  Enjoy the criminal charges and likely civil suit they then file against you."

"unless the dog is unresponsive when you knock on the glass.

"> In some states if someone saw you breaking a window it would be legal to shoot you. At the very least I would tackle you. You don't mess with people's property. You mind your own business.

If you don't want people breaking your window, don't leave a dog in a hot/freezing car.

> Again, you shouldn't ever mess with someone's else's property. Dogs count as property in many states.

Here's the thing: a table can't tell what the temperature is. A box of lightbulbs doesn't have a working brain or nerve endings. A vase can't be hungry or thirsty or fucking dying of heat exhaustion. There's more to it than just calling dogs 'property'. Jesus Christ.

"I don't know what part of the world you are from but I think you seriously underestimate how quickly temperatures can rise inside a car. It can get over 110F in summer here (Melbourne, Australia) and inside a car, can kill within minutes. And yet, you hear about babies or dogs dying in cars every fucking year.

I'm not waiting around for the police. If I see a dog or child in a car on a hot day and they look like they're in distress, I'm breaking the window and then I'm calling the police. By the time anyone can turn up, the occupant could be dead. I don't care about your car window and -- if you understand that the occupant was in danger -- neither should you. But you know, you left a dog/child in the car on a hot day so I don't really think you're capable of thinking straight.

My sister worked as a parking officer for a while. She found an infant in a car on an English summer day (about 80F). She called the police. The police ended up breaking the window, releasing the door, and removing a dead child from the car."
Wouldn't you ask them first why they are breaking the window?
"Cracking your windows without wind deflectors would leave you with a soggy interior most of the time in the UK.  I've slept in my car over night several times (wagon master-race - air beds fit in the back with the seats down) without opening the windows and experienced no ill-effects.  

I'd be interested to see exactly how much air comes from the car moving.  Most cars have the interior air intake just below the windscreen under the bonnet so there's no ram effect.  You might get some pressurisation under the bonnet from air flowing in through the grille but I imagine it would be lost through the bottom of the engine bay before it had much of an effect on interior air flow.  

Honestly leaving your dog in your car for 20 minutes isn't going to give them carbon monoxide poisoning.  "

"My assumption would be that they rely on weather forecast/records to denote days that the citation/ charges are applicable. But that's just speculation on my part. 

I don't see how car internal temperature could be used in a practical way since you'd have to break into the car to take a reading?"
"It's probably harder to enforce ""don't keep your dog in internal temps above Y"" than it is to say ""don't keep your dog inside when the outside temperature exceeds X"", since in the former you have no easy way of proving that the inside temperature of the car really was too high without access to the inside of the car somehow.

I don't have AC and I and my pets are fine in the summer. Car is different where a human or animal's health can be at risk within minutes on a hot day.

What is virtue signalling?
You're barking up the right tree (no pun intended). Just saying that to many people it's just as important to publicize their willingness to perform this good deed as it is to actually perform it.
"I assume that he has never had his car broken into to ""save"" a dog, but why let that get in the way of a good counterpoint for reddit?"
Living in the sticks where people shoot at trespassers and thiefs.
Unless your unoccupied car is on your private property then you really can't (legally) shoot someone for breaking into it. Right to life/non-injury supersedes property rights.
"In Florida you can use deadly force to prevent a forcible felony, which includes a car jacking. "
Don't question the facts learned at /r/all law school.
"You never know who you're dealing with. Some drug dealer who left his pit bull in the car to protect his stash. He sees you break window he opens fire to save his stash.

My dog stays in the bed of my truck on hot days. I see you near my truck i might assume you're trying to steal my dog. My response wouldn't be nice. 

There's many, many reasons why you should just mind your own business "
"There are legit reasons for not allowing strangers to touch a dog. One of which is that the dog is expected to act as a guard or service animal. Pleasant contact with strangers can go a long way to undoing that, as the animal could start associating being friendly to strangers with praise. A person bringing their animal out in public doesn't mean they are obligated to allow anybody and everybody to touch it."
How does not wanting strange kids touching my dog make me a wacko? I don't want strangers touching anything of mine. 
"I also don't let strangers pet my dog if they ask but not because he's my property or that he's not friendly, but because I'd just prefer they didn't. I spend a decent amount of time hiking alone in secluded locations with the dog and prefer he treat strangers with disinterest and not turn into a mushy love puddle if I encounter someone else on the trail. Am I going to flip my shit if someone pets him without asking in the city? Naw. If I'm deep in the woods and alone? I wouldn't love it."
It's people like OPs car I'd hope to spot a dog in distress in just so I could break his window fully legally just to take him down from his pedestal. 
Then you better damn pay for the window .
"Legally, dogs are property, aren't they? Beside the point. 

 I'm not saying let them roast or freeze, im pretty sure they can wait a few extra minutes for an authority to arrive and do a proper job. Hell, call a tow truck to break in and get them out with doing any damage. "
"Fuck off.  The reason these signs exist is because angsty teen redditors just can't resist the urge to ""save"" someone else's pet that's just fine."
"And chances are nothing bad will happen to you. 

But by minding my own buisness I'm assured I won't have to deal with any added bullshit that day. "
"Nope. Deal with the fact people are shitty and try to get the cops to press animal abuse charges.

Break my window and I'm pressing charges for vandalism and attempted theft or whatever. 

You really should never mess with a person's property. "
She gets socialized plenty. I have a large family and plenty of friends. Still not letting strangers touch my dog.
"Uh, she is. What about it?

I suppose calling my female dog a bitch would be really offensive to you though."
"Nope. If it is my vehicle and I see you breaking a window I know you're damaging my property. I don't care what your reasoning is. 

If it's someone else's vehicle I might call the cops and report a possible vehicle theft, then I'd continue on my way. "

Yes. I have yet to leave my baby in my Tesla since he's 3 now and in school all day but I've got another one in the works.  I'm running into the store for something it may just be easier to leave him in the car sleeping with the AC going. The 3 year old would wait in the car as an infant with AC blasting when I ran into the store to do stuff fairly frequently in my BMW X5.
Why not?
It's a bad idea not because of the benefits but the negatives. Better to just improve cars than attempt a ban like that. Though I would like to reclaim more city centres for pedestrians.

Of course not, but not letting a kid who loves dogs and maybe isn't allowed one have a very brief interaction with your dog for no other reason than ""it's mine not yours"" just comes off as overly possessive and childish. Assuming the dog is friendly and likes interacting with strangers and all that.

My dogs don't like strangers, and they don't want strangers stroking them so they avoid and ignore them, when people or children ask if they can stroke them I just tell them they're not very friendly and weary of strangers. But if they were friendly and liked being stroked why wouldn't i? People like to stroke dogs and most dogs like being stroked and interacting with people. Why be unnecessarily possessive?

I'm not saying you can't just that it's weird to me.

But ***why*** is it such a bad thing for them to interact with someone? Why are you so possessive of him? That's the part i don't understand.

>mushy love puddle

Lets be real, is a brief stroke or pat really generally totalling no more than 5-10 seconds ""turning into a mushy love puddle""

>If I'm deep in the woods and alone? I wouldn't love it.

Why?

My dogs show no interest in other people and walk right passed people who want to stroke them, but if they were the opposite it makes absolutely no difference to me, I just don't understand the possessive nature of some dog owners.

I'm not saying you can't be, just that i don't understand it.

"> Break my window and I'm pressing charges for vandalism and attempted theft or whatever.

Lol, good luck. Whatever you think the law says about letting you shoot people who touch your shit, you know laws need to be enforced by somebody right? Good luck getting the cops you call to arrest someone for saving your dog. Good luck getting a judge to impose any real punishment when you press charges anyway.

At best, you'd get your window replaced. And if you force someone else to pay for saving a life from your mistake, then you're just a shitty person. See how easy it is to make sweeping statements about what values people should have?"
Wouldn't fly.
"Citizens don't press charges, prosecutors do. And if the facts are such that no actual crime was committed, they won't charge just because you insist. So you'd have to sue in civil court, and then you'd have to try to convince a jury that you're entitled to compensation after someone saved your dog from your poor decision making. "
Hard to believe. The you having friends or family part.
"Unless your dog said what i quoted, i was saying YOU sounded like a bitch. "
"You do you. We'll do us. Besides, if some dumbass left their dog in a hot car, not only would the window be broken, never mind how pissed the owner would be, wouldn't be more pissed than me and an angry crowd

We'll sort out the legalities later. "
So in some states someone might break your car window cause she think there is a dog/child/elderly suffering inside and in real danger and you gonna shoot that person no question asked. That is what people find puzzling amount America.

"There's lots of other reasons than ""she's mine"". I just don't feel the need to explain them to every person we encounter. So it would be much easier just to have people leave us alone"
"And? My point was that just because someone has their dog in public it doesn't mean they are obligated to allow strangers to interact with it. There isn't anything ""wacko"" about that, and it doesn't really warrant an explanation from an individual if they prefer you don't touch their animal. In fact, I would say people who insist that any dog being walked is fair game for petting upon request is the one who has the problem."
"I have a well behaved dog. Border collie/Catahoula. But yes, she knows not to approach strangers or leave my side unless I allow her.

And when people do run up to put my dog I step in between them and my dog and ask them not to touch my dog.
""But.. but.. my kid won't hurt her, she just want to pet the doggy""
I don't care, leave my dog the fuck alone.

Or I just lie and say she bites to get people to shut up. She's actually super sweet and great with kids. But I don't want strange people touching my dog. "
"The thing is, and I'm truly not being flippant here, is that it's okay that you don't understand it. I prefer my dog to act and interact with the world one way and you prefer for yours to do it another way. Neither way is detrimental to our pets, so I think it's a no harm/no foul kinda of thing. 

As for a more in-depth plunge into my psyche I can say that I certainly don't think of my dog as a possession and I'm not trying to keep people from touching my stuff. As a woman, walking alone in the woods, I use my dog for protection and not for socializing so I like my dogs to have a healthy, but not unreasonable, skepticism of strangers. I have run into openly armed men with pistols, not hunting rifles, in the woods. I have absolutely told them that my dog was not friendly and that they should not approach me. Do I think they were going to harm me? Not really. Would I rather be safe than sorry? You bet."
"Yeah, I'm guessing OP wouldn't risk life in prison for cold blooded murder to shoot someone saving his animal. If he would he's mentally unstable and should get rid of everything that could be used as a weapon in his vicinity. "
"But the thing is you have no idea if the dog is suffering or how long it's been in the car. 

A little over 10 years ago I had caught some guy attempting to smash my window out to ""save"" my dog. I was literally gone for probably less than a minute dropping a DVD in the Blockbuster return slot.  

If you think an animal is suffering, call the police. It's not your place to be smashing out people's windows, and you'll surely be paying to fix them. "
"I think the point he's trying to make is to call animal control or police, don't ever break the window yourself. Authorities of either type will get there soon enough, the dog likely isn't going to die in the few minutes it takes. The fucked up world that we live in, it's very possible you could end up being in the wrong and pay damages plus god knows what else bcuz fuck logical justice system, all for someone else's dog. 

**This is of course just for a dog. If it's a human in question, break the window. "
"Everyone keeps saying ""call animal control or the police"". Well, I am the police so let me tell my story of Whole Foods Bitch.

Now WFB is a story I like to tell, because it illustrates several factors that come into policing. Discretion, response time, and how normal citizens can fuck up, not just evil people. 

I work as an officer in a very hot area of the county. Summer highs typically are 90-100. I work for a very undermanned department. To cover about 30 sq. miles of urban sprawl, we had maybe 6 officers working that day. As a result, when the call came in from a concerned citizen that a dog was locked in a vehicle at the Whole Foods, I was not immediately available to take the call. I believe I was trying to finish a traffic accident. We will say the call came in at 1400 hours. I finished my accident at 1410, went to the Whole Foods and I arrived at 1420.  I locate the vehicle with the dog in it by 1422. That is 22 minutes AT LEAST that this dog was left in 90+ degree weather. It was a medium sized dog. The suv had leather seats and was turned off. The front windows were cracked about two fingers down. The backs were rolled up completely. 

I immediately notify animal control to respond. The dog doesn't appear to be displaying any signs of suffering, but I don't know dogs that well. It was definitely not barking like one would expect a stranger looking into the vehicle would. I go inside Whole Foods, go up to customer service and I have them announce the license plate and car type over the intercom, to see if someone will come out to the car. I go back out to the car and wait. Around 1435-1440 is when Animal Control showed up. They used a infrared thermometer to determine that the temperature in the car is exceeding 120 degrees. Policy dictates we can break windows if the animal is in danger and Animal Control stated it was. As I'm notifying my supervisor that I'm about to bust the window, WFB walks out with her 5 and 8 year old. She asks what's going on, and I tell her to immediately turn the AC on. I have my own personal mandatory arrest policy for people that I charge with cruelty to animals, however in lieu of her kids being there, I cut her a ticket. The entire time, she is rolling her eyes, chastising me, stating ""It's not even that hot. I had the window cracked. I was only gone for maybe 10 minutes."" Finally, she told me the reason she left the dog in the car. ""My house is being shown today and I didn't want her to mess up the sale at all."" 



My point is, that people SHOULD wait for the police or animal services to come and do the dirty work. But oftentimes it's not going to be as soon as people would like. You assume responsibility when you break the window as a civilian, but if the animal is in danger, they may not be able to wait for the police to come."
"I'm not saying they're right, but you have to acknowledge that some people will judge the value in monetary terms. Dogs, depending on the breed, can be cheaper than window repair costs.

It's fine that you want to save dogs' lives, but you should consider the legality of what you're suggesting."
"In your good Samaritan, dog saving, world what happens after you smash the window? The dog is probably terrified at the window being broken in next to it by a stranger. So it either takes off or bites you."
"endangered or not, you will pay for the window. If it's not worth $100 to save teh dog then don't break the window. "
Exactly.  The jury would laugh at him.  
Uh that's not how the law works (or should work) The cops don't get to choose when/which laws to enforce.
How is breaking my truck window not a crime? I'm pretty sure you're damaging my property. 
"A random tangent along the same lines, the victim of a crime doesn't press charges.  A prosecutor can press charges against the perpetrator, even if the victim pleads for it not to happen.  In practice, this isn't common, presumably because it would be awfully difficult to get a conviction when the victim won't even cooperate."
"What is so puzzling about property rights to the rest of the world lol???

They will be fine with the car on for five minutes.  It's the people who leave them in there with the cars off or completely forget about them that have this happen.  5 minutes to go buy something at rite aid is not going to kill a dog or a kid with the car and AC on. 
The kid takes a bigger risk driving to school everyday. The rare events are just more publicized so we tend to overestimate their likelihood. 
"No, I am not daft. 

I'm beginning to wonder about you, though. "
"I mean nice example and all, but the dude said ""a dog"" not ""my dog"".  This could suggest that the person may live in a household where a family member/roommate has a dog that isn't necessarily his/her.  It could also mean he doesn't even own a dog and why are you calling others daft?"

"[Hellooooo, carpool lane!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxW2mNmdGqQ)"
This was my first thought
"Where I'm at, they're ""I'm rich and everyone else is a sucker for following the law"" lanes."
Not that I know of. 
Still waiting on my sticker
They are in Georgia but I'm not sure about other places.
"In FL, vehicles that get over I think 45 mpg can apply of a HOV sticker so they be exempt if a single driver for the HoV lane. There was a list somewhere and even the Volvo Diesels were listed..until they were unlisted. "
Sorry for your loss
"It seems by far most prevalent on the left right now, though I'm open to any arguments that point out apolitical or conservatives mass-virtue signalling. Nothing came to mind at such a scale when I wondered about it.

"
"He said, ""there had better be some evidence that you felt you were at risk of grievous bodily harm."" The man in your example was at risk of ""serious harm or death.""

So, what were *you* saying?"
"Can't generalize it like that. These are all state-level offenses and the laws will vary by state. Protecting a child from imminent harm (such as an assailant breaking the window, perhaps with the intention to abduct or harm the child occupying the vehicle) is legal in most if not all states. Whether this defense would work for shooting someone trying to break into your car in a public parking area in your state or not depends on the nuances of state law. The culture in the area will also determine whether or not it is politically expedient for a prosecutor to pursue charges, and also whether or not a jury is likely to convict."
"In Florida you can shoot them if they are breaking into your vehicle or home and it is occupied as the forceful entry gives reasonable suspicion that the intruder intends great bodily harm or death to yourself or someone else. 

Edit. In Texas IIRC you can shoot to defend personal property, due to cattle laws"
"Let's see how that argument holds up when you're six feet under and his lawyer is using whatever state law or precedent he can find for a justifiable homicide defense. 

I know in my state, simply attempting a felony, on or to another persons property, is sufficient for use of lethal force. So you'd be ""saving a kid"" and wind up dead. The cops show up and the guy says you broke his window and were trying to grab his little kid out of the car. Your family tries to file charges claiming /u/withinthegiant would never do such a thing, but the DA rejects the case, since there's ample precedent and state law defending what the guy claimed happened."
"You have no idea what you're talking about. It obviously varies state by state but in my state you are authorized to use deadly force to prevent death or great bodily harm to someone else. You may also shoot someone in the process of a forcible felony, which in my state includes car jacking. So of my child is in my car and I see someone violently trying to break my window and enter my vehicle (which also touches upon castle doctrine and is also protected in my state) you're damn right I'm going to shoot them."
"Well it's all about what would a reasonable person do? This is the standard used for a situation like this. I would think that a reasonable person, if they see a grown man breaking their vehicle window out, knowing their defenseless child is inside would be justified in using deadly force regardless of whether or not you are on your own property. Deadly force can be used if one believes themselves or another is in imminent peril to their own life, or in imminent peril to great bodily injury.

Now, to muddy it up. You cannot leave your child in your vehicle unattended for ANY reason, if they are not able to legally take care of themselves. You can get away with the AC on for a dog. You can't for a child. 

"
[deleted]
"""f you leave your child/pet in a car when it's extremely hot outside you deserve to have your window broken and you deserve to go to jail."" uh what? this entire thread is about a car in which the AIR CONDITIONING IS ON. YOU should go to jail for damaging someone else's property. mind your own fucking business.
"
"People have died for less. Whether it's normal or not, dont put yourself in a position to have someone overreact and take your life. You may feel justified for saving their dog, but what does it matter if they shoot you in the head; You've just made a choice that ended your life, but on the flip side, you feel really good about yourself. Priorities people.."
[removed]
"Correct. Are we just stating random facts, or does that have something to do with the conversation at hand? Are you implying that you can shoot anyone committing a felony? If so, that's false."
"Well, if you had them in the cab, they'd have every right in some states to break the window if it was hot out.  Not many though.  Some just have laws against it and they call the cops."

"Eh, we all fuck up somewhere. Have a great day/night whatever it is wherever you are. "
"> Doing something like breaking into someone's car puts you into a really bad spot, even if your intentions are good.

That's what I've been trying to say. People do some fucked up shit. I've lived around gun toghting rednecks for many years of my life. You mess with their vehicle, they are liable to shoot you, no questions asked. Do you want to be that guy that let a cop know something might be wrong with a situation, or do you want to be that idiot who thought they were being so magnanimous that they got themselves killed trying to be such a good samaritan they didn't use logic to deal with a situation? IDK about you, but I'm gonna live to see another day because people will kill you for fucking with their property. That's just a fact.

"
"Okay, so you still haven't answered where it is legal to shoot someone for smashing a car window."
">  I see you near my truck i might assume you're trying to steal my dog. My response wouldn't be nice.

How the fuck do you equate someone being ""near"" your truck to vandalizing it?"
"First off people typically don't ""run up to strangers dogs."" They walk past and see a friendly doggy wagging his tail and begging for attention and so they give him a pet. Also children and dogs are completely different entities. Lots of people come up to babies and give them attention just like they would a dog."
You sound fucking miserable. 
"i'm more worried about some stranger pinching or pulling its tail or ears causing it to bite them, then they'll cry about it to the authorities saying my pet up and attacked them for no reason

fuck that.  i'm not going to risk a fine or my pet's life just so you can get happy feels.  get your own damn dog"
You kinda just sound like a dick.
You're a huge autistic cunt haha
"Yeah i figured it was something about protection when you mentioned being alone in the woods.

I don't really expect my dogs to act anyway in particular, as long as they're not aggressive, can listen and are responsive when I call them (So there's not a situation of them running into a road, or running up to a dog on a muzzle or whatever dangerous situation) i just let them be.

I guess we all view dogs and pets in general differently, to me they're not animals that i command and do my bidding (not saying you do), they're my buddies that i chill with at the park, i let them choose if they want to be social or not. Other people need or want their dogs to perform tasks, yours is protection so i guess that's why we have a different outlook on it.

Cheers for the plunge though."
What if you'd got caught up in there for some reason. Your dog would be dead and maybe then you would wish that someone had broken the window
Take your dog with you. The car is not the dog house. Or leave it at home.
"WTF? At the end of the day, the fucking window gets broken. How on Earth does it make it better if the ""authorities"" do it? If anything, more of **your money** gets wasted: you now pay not only for the window, but also contribute to the work the authorities did."
"She seems to be named appropriately.
But my dog never barks, doesn't mean she's in distress, she's just not a vocal dog."
"What are you on about? Do you think people break windows just because they see an animal in there? What the fuck do you think, that people here just like to ruin peoples property for the fun of it? If you see an animal I distress in a car you break the window, as simple as that. "
"Such a dog would be very, very rare. If a dog is in heat stress, it will definitely show gratitude at being removed from that situation. You must not know anything about dogs."
This depends in where you live and in most places it is fully legal to break a window to save a distressed animal. I will break a window and I will not pay for it if I'm in the legal right to do so. You should've thought about not leaving an animal in your car if you didn't want your window broken. 
"That's how the law has always worked.  They can arrest both of you, throw out the case of vandalism and press you for animal cruelty.  Law is circumstantial to a large degree.  Most DAs don't want to try to prosecute a ""Good Samaritan"" style act if it going to get them bad press.  The cops can enforce both and then the legal side decides it isn't worth it and dismisses some.  


Hell blatantly guilty people, even with not enough evidence to get a conviction, will get arrested and public ally perp walked just to fuck up their reputation.  "
That's literally what cops do daily. Ever been pulled over for speeding and get off with a warning? That's an officer using discretion. 
Cops shouldn't have discretion on whether or not someone needs to be arrested (as opposed to cited and told to show up in court)? Or judges shouldn't be able to adjust their sentencing based on the circumstances of the case? Which one is not okay?
"It's not a crime in about half of the states in the country that protect ""good Samaritans"". Google hot car laws and stop being a cunt with your internet tough guy facade."
"Because intent is often an element of crimes, and there can be exceptions when something is done to prevent harm to another. Then even if the action is technically against the law, it would still require a district attorney to prosecute a Good Samaritan, which would draw considerable bad press. "
"How is shooting someone who broke into your home not a crime? I'm pretty sure you're shooting someone.

Circumstances matter.  Maybe you're just trolling, though."
"Yep, happens all the time with domestic violence cases. Sometimes there's enough evidence to convict without the victim showing up, though."
Yup totally america does have a history of property over life 
i think it's more the shoot first ask questions later mentality
"The idea is that you can replace property, life is a bit harder."
I understand what you are saying but I'm not talking specifically about cops. 
OOHH GOOTTTT EEEM Reddit is for talking my ass. Sit down and shut up. 
"You're right that I conflated a/my dog. But the original post is about someone keeping their dog in their car, and how this is a nice thing for them to be able to do responsibly with their Tesla. If I posted a top level comment that simply read ""I don't own a Tesla"", it would be - in a similar way - a non sequitur. Just a comment to point out I cannot relate to the subject matter."
"And to your question, probably because dogs are a very important part of my life, and I think people who do not own dogs, and do not want them, intentionally do not understand the people on the other side. I believe it's implied the commenter wouldn't want a dog in his car because he finds them dirty, and I imagine the same person picking their child up from soccer practice ""oh, you're too dirty, you're not getting in my Tesla"". If you learn how much a dog can mean to someone, you will see the similarity."

I guess my point is that would be the last thing on my list of things that could go wrong in this hypothetical scenario that we are making up. But very few own or carry guns where I live. My imaginary worst case scenario would that I would be beaten to a pulp by a mma fighter. Best case a dog is saved and I may need to pay for a $200 window.

Where did I say anything about legal? What are you going on about?
re-read the comment chain and maybe you'll figure it out this time
"I travel a bunch and I got tired of worrying when I went to other states. I live in Wyoming with constitutional carry so I'd often forget about it in my center console, then have a mild oh shit moment if I got pulled over out of state"
"It's never legal to shoot someone for property damage like breaking a window. It's legal to use lethal force in defense of self or others.

In states with castle doctrine, anyone attempting to forcibly enter a private domicile is considered an imminent threat to life and limb and there is no duty to warn or retreat when using lethal force in defense against such a person. This may also apply to vehicles parked on the property. The specifics will vary by state.

Thus, in some places and under some circumstances, a person may be able to legally consider someone attempting to forcibly enter a vehicle by breaking its window a lethal threat and legally respond with lethal force.

Ultimately, if the prosecutor thinks your use of force was unjustified, it will be the jury's call whether this was a reasonable assumption or not."

All those have stand your ground laws. Where it's legal to use lethal force with ""no duty to retreat from the situation before resorting to deadly force; not limited to your property (home, office, etc.)""

The law removes a person’s duty to retreat before using deadly force against another in any place he has the legal right to be – so long as he reasonably believed he or someone else faced imminent death or great bodily harm. Among the Stand Your Ground cases identified by the paper, defendants went free nearly 70 percent of the time.


It's not unreasonable that someone could defend themselves with stand your ground law if the felt you breaking into their car was a threat to their safety. Maybe you were going to use whatever tool you used to break the window to harm the vehicle owner in the process of stealing their car. How are they to know you're just engaging in property damage to prevent a perceived threat to a animals livelihood and not doing something more malicious, like stealing the car, or dog?

It's might be a stretch, it might not be. "
"Doesn't matter if it's legal. Bullets still kill whether the person who shoots you is in the right or the wrong. You may feel like you did the right thing by breaking their window, but if they kill you, you're dead. Do not pass go, do not collect $200. You're dead, but I guess you'll feel really good about yourself in heaven. Let me know how that works out for you, or whether it mattered if that person broke the law when he killed you.."

That's not always an option.
Some people take their dogs everywhere with them. Running into a store for five minutes and leaving your dog in a car with the window down is no worse than putting it outside to play/pee/poop. People need to mind their own business. 
"You must be slow, that's ok. I very specifically suggested not to break the window for a dog. Because, as I said, you're removed from liability by *not breaking the window* and allowing police to do it. "
Maybe legal but you are mistaken if you think you can't be held accountable for the cost of the window.

"What did you mean by ""can"" if not legally? Like physically? You were asking him if it's physically possible to kill someone for breaking a window?

Actually it would be. 100%. If you are at a distance with your weapon drawn on someone breaking your property Stand Your Ground will not protect you from committing murder. I'd say try and see but I don't want an innocent to die just so some wannabe warrior can find out they know fuck all about the laws surrounding their weapon they likely don't deserve to be carrying.

My dad takes his dog with him almost everywhere. He has extreme separation anxiety (the dog) and will cry when my dad is out of sight. So my dad parks where he can see the car and sits by the window at restaurants so his dog can see him while he eats. 
No need to resort to a personal attack.
"1) That wasn't the argument you presented.  You made a false statement that cops don't get to use discretion, it was pointed out that you were wrong.  That anecdote is irrelevant to the argument at hand.

2) That's literally what discretion is.  In some cases, when there is no party actually harmed, officers will use discretion to not write a citation.  Other times, they will use their discretion to write a citation.  You essentially disproved your own point.

3) You guys are talking about traffic infractions anyhow, not ""crimes"".  To use an example of a crime where an officer commonly uses discretion, let's look at smoking weed.  It's a crime in most jurisdictions, but officers commonly do not enforce it."
Don't leave your dog in the car and nobody will break your window! People do and should care a whole lot more about a dog than they do an assholes window.
"You should've thought about that before committing an act of animal cruelty. I absolutely love how you put a fucking car window as more valuable than an animals life, it's disgusting to say the least. I will break any window to save an animal and in most places it's fully legal so how about you sit the fuck down and realize that animal cruelty is not okay. "
"Ok, you call the police, ""someone just smashed the window out of my car!"" Police show up, presumably the guy is still there and you point him out ""that's the guy, arrest him!"" 

Police: ""Sir, did you smash in the window of this man's vehicle?""  
Guy: ""Yeah, it's a hundred degrees out and he left his dog in there. I tapped on the window to get his attention but he was unresponsive. I got the dog out and gave him some water. Here's the dog. Then I waited for the police to arrive.""  
You: ""Aha he just admitted it. Arrest him. And give me back my dog.""  
Police: ""Ok sir, we're going to take down both of your information, file a report, and refer it to the DA for possible criminal damage to property. They'll contact you if they need more information. And for future reference, don't leave your dog in the car.""

Then a DA gets the police report and has to decide if he wants to charge this guy with a crime. He can decline to charge, he can just charge it as a municipal violation and a ticket, or he can charge you with endangering an animal. It doesn't matter what you think his intent was. "
"Maybe, I don't know...don't shoot people if you aren't sure of the situation? Isn't that responsible gun ownership 101 material? If you're assuming, you probably shouldn't take out your gun. "

All that effort for a massive fail :< 
"In hot areas where children die from heatstroke in cars, it is far more common for that to happen than for a child to be kidnapped by a stranger. Especially in a public place after doing something that can draw significant attention. I've known multiple people who have killed their child by forgetting it was in a vehicle. I've known none that were kidnapped by strangers. Not to mention the thousands of pets that die.

The point remains that the post I replied to said:

>Where, in the US, can someone be shot for breaking into an unoccupied car? I've never heard of that, and it sounds absurd.

Which *is* literally and explicitly about unoccupied vehicles. There isn't a state in the union that allows you to use lethal force against someone over a property crime. Sure, if someone is trying to take the kid off while it protests or after they've obviously done something illegal or destructive to get them, then shoot them. But if someone is breaking a window of a car with a kid or animal inside of it in sweltering heat, it's far more likely they're trying to help out. Offer to help wait until help arrives. Talk to them. You don't just get to shoot people unless you're in reasonable fear for the life or imminent physical safety of yourself or someone near by. And an overheated car poses far more of a statistical risk than do strangers in public places."
"**EDIT**: Oh ok!!!! Nice edit you fuck ass! 


No it didn't say that what so ever.... Direct quote below

>If you see a car with a dog locked inside on a hot day call the police or animal control. Don't break a window.

You don't mess with people's property. You mind your own business. You (presumably) pay taxes to support a bloated police force. Let them do their job.

Sometimes they don't know any better than to ask first. No one is disrespecting you or your shit, cowboy.

""" > And when people do run-up to pet my dog I step in between them and my dog and ask them not to touch my dog. ""But.. but.. my kid won't hurt her, she just want to pet the doggy"" I don't care, leave my dog the fuck alone.

Not letting kids run up to your dog and pet them without asking is perfectly acceptable, every decent parent teaches their kid to ask.

But in the other thread you're very possessive of your dog and as you said, just want people to leave your dog the fuck alone. It doesn't matter if they ask or not

>I don't even let people pet my dog. She's not here to make you happy, she's here for me.

Again, it's not about not wanting people to ask permission you just said the dogs only purpose in life is to make you happy and serve you, no one else can interact with it.

>Or I just lie and say she bites to get people to shut up. She's actually super sweet and great with kids. But I don't want strange people touching my dog.

Why is everyone strange to you?


No one said they wanted to order your dog around, or that it was okay to run up to a random dog and start smothering it, i asked you why a kid couldn't stroke your dog if they asked and you replied ""why would i want a strange kid touching my dog"" Rather than something along the lines of ""she's a working dog and i don't want her to become too friendly with strangers""

 
Comment from his other thread. Sums it up nicely. "
"I don't see where you can make that statement based off of what he said? Service dogs are a completely objective different scenario then regular dogs, they are there to do a job and it is bad for them to be distracted while doing that job. It's understandable for someone to not want strangers to touch their dog to a degree I guess, depending on the reasons why such as ""kids can be unpredictable and could do some pretty dumb things"" which is a true and valid reason but the way this person is coming off is just a weird tone, like he/she/it has a issue with human interaction and contact with other people, it sounds like this person would be bothered by someone even approaching them for a casual conversation. The reasoning is because of a rule he/she was taught as a kid which is a pretty irrational rule and hasn't rationalized the fact that it was a nonsensical thing and makes no sense."

By the sounds of it that's a good thing. 
Where i come from (Germany) the law is pretty relaxed about it. So if someone enters my home and threatens me i can kill him and not go to jail. The risk of it happening is so low i don't know anyone who talks about it.
Y'all are just convincing me to never let my dog leave the ranch. Seeing how I can't trust people to not bother her.

"Yes, she legally is my property. 

She's a working dog I expect absolute obedience and loyalty out of. I have a large family that can love on her plenty because they will respect the rules I set for her, strangers won't.

 I try to keep her from getting any annoying habits. She goes to her bed when I eat, and I don't allow her any human food to avoid her begging for example. Running up to greet people in hopes of getting a reward (petting) is a bad habit. She needs to be focused on me, especially out in public and around other dogs/ livestock. Around where I live an errant dog will get shot. And a poorly behaved dog won't be allowed to come to work with me, then she'd have to sit in her kennel all day. I like her and would like to have her helping me with cattle and such.

 I also don't entirely trust strangers or kids with grubby grabby hands. And personal distaste of people acting entitled. "
Well yeah that's never ended well for anyone. You should always have that dog confined by a leash or fence. Im sure you might live in a rural area but dogs can't read or figure out that they maybe shouldn't do something. Seriously you don't want to have to get your dog put down for biting someone. It sucks :( 
"No, only to you. As evidenced by the heaps of downvotes you've collected, you seem to be the only one with this ""if you or your kid tries to pet my dog you're disrespecting me and my property"" mental defect. Most other people advanced past that ""MINE!"" stage of childhood, and also understand that kids are stupid and don't know about your arbitrary rules you've created for your dog.

I just hope to God you never tried to pet someone else's dog as a kid, that would have been so disrespectful of you. "
"Well if you had reading comprehension you would understand that his ""rule"" he was taught as a kid is to not ""pet or boss another man's dog"". Which is just one of those weird rules that sucks enjoyment out of lives. Now obviously you don't go up to a person's animal and just start petting it, you ask first. But to be in the mindset that it's a terrible and disrespectful thing to do is just straight up delusional .

EDIT: also to mention your dog to human analogy is terrible, Humans aren't dogs, humans don't like being pet. Dogs enjoy being pet and it's good interaction for them. Also, I literally said their are valid reasons to not want your dog being pet and I understand that, just the reasoning for her is she thinks its disrespectful other people even want to touch her dog which is just a crazed thought to even have. It seems like you didn't even read my reply and just made a reply based on what you felt like saying. I would like to see more effort next time bud."

$576 fee for parking for a day. There will be some cool stories to read soon :)
"Damn. That *was* super quick, given the exchange  between a Tesla owner and Elon that likely sparked this happening occurred [on December 10th](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/807787096727425024). "
"I am fully supportive of this. 5 minute grace period is sufficient given you're always aware of how much time remains. Hope they don't make a lot of money on this but if they do, that will help expand the network. Double win. "
">How will I be billed?
>You will be billed for any idle fees incurred at your next Service Center visit.

Ok, that's pretty creative. However, you sure can see a bunch of cases where you're going to bill someone a year later, and they'll claim they had no idea. Also, what if you sell the car and it has $1,500 in parking on the VIN?"
"Reading through the comments... no wonder this has become such a problem. Half of folks don't even understand what they have been doing wrong. If it's so difficult to come back and move your vehicle, then the thing you chose to do while waiting was not an appropriate thing to be doing. Superchargers are for parking, and making somebody else wait (heck, even for five minutes) is inconsiderate.

Restaurant a 15 minute walk away? Not willing to get up in the middle of a meal to go move your car? Well gosh, I guess maybe that restaurant isn't an option then. At least, that's what you should be thinking.

Sometimes shit happens, and that's fine. You just pay the fee and move on. But if what you're doing isn't worth 40 cents per minute, you have no business making other people wait while you do it.

I get the situation where there wasn't anybody actually waiting, and maybe that doesn't warrant this fee (like if more than 2 or 3 other spots are open).  But if that's the tradeoff, I'd say it's worth having for the times when it *is* needed. Besides, refinements can always come as time goes on."
I honestly don't see how anyone could have an issue with this.

I don't own a Tesla but I do remember seeing a post in Reddit like a week ago with Elon Musk responding to a tweet about this. I've never seen a CEO so responsive to consumer complaints 
So glad to hear this. Will make things so much better for you guys in California. 
Seems like a lot when they aren't full. Wish it were 15m grace period when there are >= 2 spots free or something.

"They are fucking quick on the draw, Tesla. Love it."
"Ok reading the 400 plus comments I feel that owners don't seem to understand that supercharging is not for when you decide to goto a restaurant or goto the mall to shop. 

They are and have always been for long distance road trips. I live near a mall with a supercharger and I drive my Tesla that is 50-90% full and park in a regular spot and do my shopping, because I do my local charging in my garage while I'm sleeping. 

Sounds like owners just go meet friends out for dinner and plug in for a top-off. This policy is a great start, but there has to be a model where you pay if you are charging near your home. "
[deleted]
"There should definitely be an exception for empty or nearly empty superchargers.  
Here in the midwest I rarely see anyone else using the local supercharger (out of 10 stalls available; I've used the SC maybe two dozen times and I have not seen ten Teslas there total) The SC is also at a location where I can do a bunch of shopping.  
Does this mean I will need to adjust the charge limit everytime I use the SC instead of just bumping my battery from 40 to 80% while I spend an hour or so in the store?  
  
I'm all for the charging charge when on the coasts where the stalls are more frequently full. But here in flyover country it seems unnecessary and kind of annoying."
[deleted]
I am a Tesla owner. This could cost me money. I absolutely applaud this move.
But in a smaller area like nc where meters aren't really a thing. No one is in a rush sadly. Just saying I think they should penalize know abusers. They must be able to track that. 
Geez. Talk about fast. It hasn't even been a week.
"So with all the automated driving tesla cars have and will receive in the future, would it be possible for them to automatically start, park nearby, and shut off by themselves? I imagine somebody would have to remove the charger safely and whatnot and that could be an issue finding parking and finding your car but it might be a possible solution? "
"How about adding a parking lot close to the superchargers and let the cars slowly drive away?  
They only need to solve the cable removal..."
Can't you just ask your car to move to a vacant and proper parking spot when its done charging?
"I honestly am surprised this wasn't a ""The car will move itself out of the way when fully charged for you"" type of announcement"
They should design the newer cars to safely eject the charger and move out automatically when fully charged.  Then queue the next car to move in automatically.
"It's a good start, however those people who want a 20 minute charge to continue to destination and wanna grab a bite to eat will just set it to 100% so they don't get charged. 

I hope they add towing signs to no charging cars so they can be towed if they think they can skirt the restriction by unplugging. "
This will probably start with 8.1 because they will need to introduce a way to charge Supercharger users for idle time. It will no doubt be a part of the same system that charges for Supercharging after January 1st. I assume their announcement today means that 8.1 is imminent.

"I hope 8.1 has live supercharging on the app. Shows the stall and estimated time remaining so you know if they are available and if not how long the wait will be. 

This penalty will help that issue along because you know if all the spots are full and someone is getting charged by the minute they should be coming out soon. "
I suggested this a year ago. My thinking was that a credit card should be entered into the system in order to unlock supercharging and then the credit card could be billed if the car was parked there for more than 5 minutes beyond charge completion.  The only issue I see with this is it states they will charge the account and payment is due at next service center appointment. What if the person never goes to the service center? 
"So someone that does not want to move their car can just unplug and leave it there to avoid fees?
"
"I assume that the car like, texts you when its done charging right?  That seems like something that would be standard issue.  "
"Theory: the non-free Supercharging coming next year won't be priced per kWh, but per minute. Maybe even $0.40/minute like the idle fee.

It would make it really easy to estimate your cost outlay - if you're gone an hour that would be $24 regardless of when your car stopped charging."
"> Due to all its vehicles being connected virtually at all time, it’s not difficult for Tesla to keep track of the fees and it plans to charge people during their next Service Center visit. The Tesla mobile app will notify you if you incurred idle fees after your charging sessions at Superchargers.

Tesla has vehicle owners by the balls! 

I thought this plan required vehicle owners to voluntarily swipe their card somewhere at the supercharging station each time (which is not plausible)"
 They should charge ICE cars for parking in the charging slot but make it $0.80 per minute with a tow away threat. It does not seem fair to penalise a Tesla for parking and not charging and not do the same or worse to an ICE.  Personally rather than pay at the next service I think it would be better to block further SC use until fee is paid with a dial up or on-line system for fee paying. It is more immediate. They should put the fees back into making improvements to the charging areas like roofs wind breaks etc as appropriate.
well you already don't buy a tesla because you like money so
"I'm in favour of this...BUT I think tesla need to be a bit cautious with the whole 'the smartphone app tells you...'. Believe it or not, I don't always bother taking my phone everywhere, and even when I do...in rural England the chances of my phone having a decent connection are probably 50/50. TFesla assume all their cars are driven in the uber-connected paradise of California. it aint so."
With the extra money they get from this they'll be able to build more superchargers right?
So what about those folks without Teslas using the Superchargers as parking spaces? I've seen that many times at my closest Supercharger.
"1) for the people who park there cant they just unplug and stay to avoid the fee?

2) i think they should only have this charge running if your parked in a full supercharger as i have used superchargers many times in almost empty superchargers and accidentally kept my Tesla plugged in for an extra ~10 min or so while getting lunch on a long road trip "
"""One would never leave a car parked at a gas station right at the pump""

Bullshit, I see it all the time. "
"If you think about it, it's like parking your ICE at the gas pump and walking away for a long time, well after it's full.  Would you ever do that with your ICE?"
"I am surprised that the Freakanomics story about imposing a fee for late child pick up from day cares. The idea is that parents were picking children up late from day care and the are givers were not able to go home on time. This is a disruption for them and they would like to curb the behavior. When the fee was imposed late pick ups actually increased. The rational for this is that the social stigma from a late pick up was a stronger deterrent than the money, as there was now a price associated with the time, which was found to be acceptable.

I am not sure that this is going to work at all.

http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/books/chapters/freakonomics.html?_r=0"
There should be an auto pilot feature that unplugs and conveniently parks nearby when the charge is complete. 
"This should be a fee assessed for repeated offenders and people that abuse it, I wouldn't call an extra 10-15 minutes an abuse. If someone walks slower it will take them extra time to get to the bathroom, and we all know that superchargers are usually far from the facilities and food places. If now people have to babysit the car before going to eat or go to the bathroom, SC stops just go much longer making the car no longer viable for long trips. There should be a rules like this but needs to be more lenient. 

While we are in the subject why doesn't Tesla have superchargers for people with disabilities and the senior?"
"Hmm... that now makes charging at a supercharger near a restaurant more stressful. All SC's I've visited so far were located beside a Restaurant. My car takes usually 30-40 minutes to fully charge when I arrive with 20%.
Especially with two kids (and abroad where you have no data network on your mobile phone to get notifications) that will be a hassle..."
"Not only with this FURTHER expand the supercharger network and pay for maintenance (I'm guessing)  but it will finally put consequences on those who just leave their car idle. (Keep in mind, if you leave your car idle for an hr thats 24$ right off that bat)"
"This punishes legitimate people too. Now when I'm enjoying lunch with my family I have to be ultra paranoid about running out as soon as my car is charged to avoid the fee.

It should only do this if all charging stations are full (implying that there must be a line)"
"As much as I like this, I have disability, I walk with a cane at times and limited in walking speed. Sometimes takes me 10-15 minutes to walk back from places. I just worry about that and my wife and child having to run off. Or while I charge and a place we eat is half a mile away. I don't want to be penalized for believing something I love. And say they eventually get auto parking done, since my car is a pre autopilot I still won't benefit. 

I know it's a problem I just wanted to add a concern I have. I love the idea though."

Q¿
Tesla really be forward thinking. I like them
You can limit Tesla's power output. How will they handle that?
And just in time for the holiday travel. Too bad there wasn't a way to tow any cars parked ina SC spot not charging. Either Tesla's or ICE. 
"Is there any warning sent to the user when his car has finished charging? SMS or email? Would be good to be, for example, at a shopping mall and receive an SMS saying ""your car is fully charged, you have 15 minutes to remove it before the extra rates are applied"". "
"I wonder if this has the opposite effect for some.   If you are paying for the privilege maybe the social stigma goes away.  

If a half hour is only going to cost $12...  I'll just finish this meal or my shopping at a leisurely pace.  At least that's what I could see some people doing. 

Similar case that's often cited. 

http://freakonomics.com/2013/10/23/what-makes-people-do-what-they-do/"
I admired how he responded to the tweet
How can they enforce this?
Good. 
"5 minutes... I dunno. That's too short. This seems to be solving a problem that only exists in a small portion of the SC network. 

My experience while traveling, stalls are never full. I'll park to charge and go grab lunch. Now I have to run out of the restaurant (be right back, promise!), and over to my car as fast as I can to move it when the app says it's done? That sucks. 

Also, this does nothing to deal with ICE cars that take up spots. Penalize the legitimate users, and let the jerks slide by. "
How long does it take to charge these things from a low battery?
Well that was quick.
"I would bet money that not only did they do analysis on this, the 5 minute mark was chosen as to get the worst offenders out of the way. Probably a pretty clear line when they graphed it out"
@elonmusk just replied to the @TeslaMotors tweet saying they will modify it to only charge when the supercharger stalls are full or close to being full.
It would be better if the autopilot moved them to free up the spot.
"How about hybrids not even plugged in sitting at EV spots.  Bastards, move on that spot is truly needed by someone-especially non Tesla EV owners.  I'm looking at you Disneyland parking garage."
[deleted]
"Yes, haven't parked there for a while but saw
The spots.  Again it's just the hybrid owners that just use it as a closer spot without using the charge I'm not a fan of (on bottom level anyway)"
"Damn that was fast. Someone tweeted to Elon earlier this week, and they already have a solution in place? Maybe they were working on it before that?"
This is crappy
Because what could take you 10 minutes may take me 15-20 min
"Uhm serious question, since theres a locking mechanism. COuldn't they just unlock the charger and put them on longer cords after a car hits full charge. Yeah pulling cords around might be a pain but will at least resolve the issue. At $.40/minutes I know a few people in my area who would not care and just leave it from the morning till their lunch. "
So why won't they move when it's done charging? 
[deleted]
"Prepared for the hate since I don't have to deal with teslas blocking superchargers often, but to me, it's a poorly thought out reaction. Will they figure out a way to charge the semis that consistently block all the chargers at once at my nearest location? Or the non-tesla cars? Who's doing the time keeping? When I first plug in the car, the estimated time to charge is not accurate enough to set a timer for a 5 minute grace period. What about the one in the movie theatre parking lot with nothing else but a McDonald's nearby? Just sit there and stare into nothing like David Puddy? There's always one or two obviously watching a movie instead but still plenty of free ones. 

The meijer and hyvee stores will be glad to know our shopping trips will be rushed for fear of penalty. Maybe they have benefits in their lease with Tesla I'm not aware of though. 

I guess they gotta do something but they are going to be fining a lot of people who are inconveniencing literally no one. 

At least the charges won't build up too much for me since the X is at the SC every other week haaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Oh :-(
"
"Extremely quick response from Elon in a very short time span. I suspect he worked on this all week. It's a well needed update to the supercharger network.

"
"Seems like if you can afford a $100,000 car,  $. 40 a minute is not bad for prime parking. "
"Good idea but 0.40 is kinda low. At $24 ""parking fee"" per hour it just provides some legitimacy for rich assholes."
"Instead of charging $ for sitting in a spot after a full charge, give them a grace period - say 20 minutes - then start discharging the battery. People will move."
Also setting it 100% may work but I don't want to do long term damage to my car.
"it shouldn't start ticking as soon as the charger is finished imo, maybe 15 minutes or so after it's finished."
"How long does it take to charge a tesla car fully? I have no idea, we are talking about what, couple of hours? "
"This should only kick in if the SC exceeds something like 60% capacity, and the tesla app should warn you if that happens while you're away. "
too bad that autoplug didnt take off. if it did the car could drive itself away from the plug automatically and when you are ready to leave you could just summon the car to you. 
"There should be a phone app where you get a ding when you are at 90%, the whole thing is like laundromat drama, people have better things to do than stand around."
What if you're on a road trip and left your Tesla on the Supercharger overnight (while you sleep) and it fills to 100%? is the fee different for off-peak or if there is low demand? 
"This is one of those things that seems like an effective idea on paper but might have unintended consequences.

For instance, if people know they're eating dinner or doing something else that will require time, they'll simply charge to 100% despite not needing that much to get to the next charger or stop.

Or they'll leave, go to the car, unplug it, and return.

Dunno. Might be a useful stop-gap but more stalls is the solution, especially with the Model 3 on the horizon. 

Edit: that said, it's a very effective deterrent to taxi services, Ubers, whatever, that camp in a slot for long periods.

I occasionally top up at a local SC as I don't have 240 volt charging at home (long story) but I don't think this will affect me. I get to where I can get by on the 120 and leave. Time will tell, I guess. Action is better than inaction!"
"What if you are on a road trip, stop at a hotel, and want to change the car overnight?"
Not enough imo. Doubt wealthy people will really care. The fee per minute should increase every X amount of time.
"I would love to see the autonomous features unplug and drive to a nearby parking space when done.  No worries about fees if you get self-driving.

Also, how does this work if a group like Tesloop sends an employee to unplug the fleet but still occupy the stalls at the end of the day?  In other words, is there any way to keep assholes from blocking the space while not charging?"
I feel 40c is too small honestly. As much Tesla owners right now are pretty well off.
[deleted]
"Just a small question from my part:

Are there other charging options available or only those superchargers? Like for example, in a garage of a company, you have some spots for employees with electric cars to charge them whilst they're working over the day. Or in my own garage at home, I have my own charger to charge overnight."
Oh no $0.40/minute idle fee when charging their $100k vehicle.  This will really motivate them to move their car.
[deleted]
Hopefully they can just automate this and our cars can charge and drive themselves home. 
"Can't say I blame them, concept is good but implementation could be significantly improved. Imagine me taking the wife to dinner when the car has a 50% charge, ""great we pick that place we love 20 miles away, they also have a charging station"". I would be pretty pissed if I am mid dinner and charges start incurring while I am enjoying my steak and feeling rushed to finsih a nice dinner.

Why not approach it differently? As I am driving up to the charging station, detect that I am entering area of parking, based on time of day, current availability, average availability (ie saturday nights more usage than tuesday morning) calculate possible overage.

""Hey we have charging stations available, based on your current charge it will take X minutes to charge to full, any minute after that for non-moving will incurr $X.XX per minute"".

They have the technology, use it and make it a choice to users ahead of time.

"
Why not have the car repark itself once full. 
"I'd anybody else worried that $0.40 a minute seems too low? 

I'm just worried about the daycare situation from the book ""Predictably irrational"" happening here: http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=19231906"
"Or is it penalise owners who don't move. Isn't an incentive something you will get, not something you will save. Nice spin spin doctors."
"This introduces zero world problems. Most of America can't afford the cars yet cali has problems with parking them?
"
Gas stations please

"It should help them a lot in urban Supercharger locations. 

Urban superchargers have enough people nearby to be abused, but are also needed to expand the market to apartment dwellers and to accommodate the eventual driverless taxi fleets. 

Tesla is clearly going for this market; the number of superchargers in LA is clearly excessive relative to the number of people passing through, and reflective of the population that lives there. "
Any idea how many hours Tesloop sits idle in a day?
Or The car should move itself when fully charged...
At first I thought the fee was excessive until I heard people were abusing the charging stations.
"This is ridiculous, Tesla promised owners free superchrarging for a lifetime, this would take back that promise. Also here in Michigan superchargers are never even close to filled, so Tesla wants me to move my car for nobody?"
I'd bet they'll have an unofficial policy of waiving fees upon request for first time offenders. The goal is happy customers.
"These are on superchargers not trickle ones.  This would be like a station you have to go to if I'm not mistaken.  If you're just leaving it plugged in at the place and leaving then that's kind of messed up, no?"
"I wonder how strict they will be. There will certainly be situations where someone may have to abandon their car at the charger. Especially if it's one where there is always an open slot.

Say medical emergency, driver has a heart attack, car left charging and they can't get back to it for a day or few. Maybe it's at one of the less used ones and there was never someone waiting. Would they be understanding and wave the fee or would they be sorry you're SOL?"
Can't wait to check /r/legaladvice once this happens 
Time for some Tesla posts on r/tifu
"Brutal for a working class Tesla owner.

Insignificant for a billionaire."
"Still cheaper than the airport. AMIRITE?!

But seriously, I can't wait for some entitled jerk to post here about how Tesla is screwing them when there's a line of people waiting to charge."
"This is probably a temporary solution. When autonomous driving gets passed, they'll likely default to the car moving itself out of the spot"
That is some bd
"Yeah, if I am counting on a charge, and people have parked their cars there blocking all the stalls, and it costs me a day....that's essentially $500 of my time."
"I'm suspect the back-end coding for this sort of thing was already being worked on for the pay-to-supercharge system being implemented Jan 1. It was probably a fairly simple adjustment. It was just a matter of ""what"" and ""how much"" that needed to be figured out. "
I'm sure this has been in the works for a while as supercharger congestion has been a problem for a while. Good timing by Elon though :) 
"I presume the Twitter exchange wasn't the first time Tesla thought about implementing a charge. It's likely been planned for months - Twitter was just a way to reduce the surprise to customers and check to see that people were on board with the concept. 

Elon was just looking for the right tweet to respond to, at about the right time. "
Nah this has been a known problem since the supercharger network started expanding
"I read his biograohy by Ashlee Vance. Elon Musk doesn't wait for things, he says he wants something done by a certain date and it happens. He probably prioritized this as soon as he had decided it was an issue and it was ready in no time. "
Not really - Tesla owners have been complaining about this issue for months.
How are you always aware how much time is left?  I'm just a reservation holder.
I would have preferred 10 minutes I have a disability and have to run to the super charger now to unplug if I'm far way.
[removed]
"I think it's too strict. Say i'm charging and go to have a meal and I plan to be done in time but the food comes out slower and the waitress is just not coming back with my credit card, now I gotta pay $4 dollars extra just because I'm 10 minutes late? And what will make people even more pissed is when there are 3 empty spots next to them. It needs to be based on availability and the grace period should be at least 20 minutes. If they are that hard up for chargers then it's time to build more."
"­­>they'll claim they had no idea

Doesn't matter. Tesla has the proof so they have to pay.

"
Another possibility is to not let them supercharge again until their debt is paid. 
I'm going to guess they will wipe anything that occurred before the date of sale for the new owner.  Title has the date of transfer on it.
"I wonder if this will end up being similar to data and other charges associated with cellular billing (overage and the like). Having worked cell phone customer support in the past these types of disputes were often reversed for the sake of customer satisfaction, although certainly not always. The human element played a key role in those scenarios where if the customer was insulting me personally or just overall being a jackass I exercised my ability to be less lenient about disputes. "
"Well I guess it's the same for any used car, you must check that it's clear of any debt. You have responsibility as a buyer to verify everything."
They could easily send them an email giving them a reminder one week or month after the fact or something.
"That's not very smart, they should have a CC on file and charge that, charging at service is asking for trouble. I love tesla, but this is an overreaction and a poor plan."
There goes any hope for 3rd party service centers in the near future.
"Not just a year. Many owners don't bother with service for a couple of years, or use 3rd party service instead, because it's a lot cheaper. I can easily see someone owning a Tesla for a handful of years without going to the official service, and then selling it off to a first time Tesla buyer, who wouldn't know to check for accumulated late fees. 

Besides, immediate consequences is a better deterrent. Just send out a monthly invoice for idle fees. "
You show Tesla your newly signed and dated vehicle title. Not only that but the fee will be linked to the previous driver so they cant just get out of it.
"My question is how is this enforceable?  Shut off SC access?  Refuse to activate a new owner until the bill is paid?  
"
Agreed. People are just going to buy Tesla cars for single-use and sell them before the next service visit. This is so fucked.
"This thread is full of entitled people. Personally I don't feel bad that they may be victim of a $0.40 a minute surcharge because they charged their $60,000+ car too long. "
You know what is a better trade-off? Gas powered cars.
"> A customer would never leave a car parked by the pump at a gas and the same thinking applies with Superchargers.

Something tells me that this was hastily written. "
"Now that you mention it, back when I was in my 20s, getting my own washer/dryer was one of the motivators for me to blow my savings on a down payment for a condo.

Maybe having your own charger in your own parking space will be the Millenials' version of your own washer/dryer. (Not post-Millenials, as they won't own cars, but that's another topic entirely.)"
[deleted]
I would plug them back in to be a dick right back. 
Seems like yes. But at that point you are at the car anyways why not move?
"I suppose, but why?

 If you are there why wouldn't you move?"
"They haven't said anything about how they know that you're plugged in. You're driving a car with GPS and a pile of cameras - they can certainly figure out if you're breaking the rules, even if you unplug. "
"It will be easy to detect unplugging it and NOT moving the car (no ignition and GPS movement), perfectly valid to assume it's still parked there."
No. The car knows it still hasent moved after charging. After charging you have to drive the car to stop the fee timer.
"Not necessarily.  A Tesla has a GPS, and also keeps track of all sorts of telemetry about itself.  It would be trivial to know whether or not it's still in the charging spot (it's not a ""parking spot"")."
Parking in a supercharger slot without being plugged in is a towable offense. Your call.
"No, Tesla knows if the motors were running after unplugging. No motor movement = still parked."
"I kind of agree, but that would make things more complex.  A blanket rule is easier to enforce. 

Also when 2 million model 3's are driving around all bets are off. "
I think it's a good idea. It inculcates a new social norm where consideration of others' equivalent needs takes priority over not wanting to bother to move a few spaces away. 
"I think it's a matter of principle. Where do you draw the line? I honestly think this is great, and I hit my fair share of empty SCs on roadtrips. Usually when I hit a SC, I need 35-60 min of charge to fill up, which is plenty of time to eat etc "
It's much easier to have a tough rule and then forgive the edge cases. The rule is always there in case you need it.
"It's only for busy locations. Superchargers that aren't full will not impose the penalty.

See: https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/810135528783937537"
It looks like that's pretty much what they're going to do.
You're vastly overestimating the Tesla demographic. My wealthy father-in-law doesn't know how to operate a smartphone but still bought a Tesla as soon as they became available. 
"""well off, intelligent technology enthusiasts with a concern for conservation of the environment"" ? Some just buy it because its a cool car.

"
"Sounds like a good idea, although then it becomes confusing and arbitrary. I like this, I think it's very fair and will make owners more eager to move their cars. "
[deleted]
"Penalty only applies to busy supercharger stations. If the site is empty, you can park without any fees. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/810135528783937537"
There probably is a grace period of 2-3 minutes so you can get out of your car and unplug.
"For real? Fuck, In NY the would tow your ass and charge you up the ass to get your car back."
"People park overnight, blocking the pump, at *open* gas stations in LA?"
"What *you* seem not to understand, curiously enough, is that people are *stuck* on a Supercharger because of that one thing that EVs are inferior at: it takes a long time to fill up. So long that you have to do *something* to kill time. Long-distance travel is good in a Tesla only if you adopt a more relaxed attitude to your speed and stops. There’s now *pointless* added stress that goes against that.

To be clear, *if* a Supercharger is busy (not even full), I *of course* make sure to get the hell out as soon as I have enough charge to make it to my next stop. I’ve only ever been on one such SC, though, on a major cross-France highway. Reduced charge rate is pretty strong incentive to get out, too.

But what’s the harm in staying 20 minutes longer after a 20 min charge on a *deserted* 8-stall Supercharger in late evening and letting me have my meal in peace? 

This new scheme punishes overnight parking (good!), doesn’t help with congestion much (b/c you’re charging slowly on full SCs and have plenty of time)(bad), incentivizes 100% needless charging (bad) and punishes relaxed use of empty SCs where there’s no harm (bad).

Something like 10mins buffer (pretty hard to get a bill in 5mins) would feel less stressful, but well, that doesn’t matter much. But charging idle fees *regardless of actual congestion* is a completely unnecessary dick move. 

Apply it only to almost full SCs, maybe make the buffer slightly larger, and jack the price up 2x-3x easy and I’d be happy about the changes. 

EDIT: That was quick: https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/810135528783937537"
"I wonder how much could be solved by getting more destination chargers out there? Did they ask the people being shitty why they are being shitty, or just decide to try this? In my case, the demand of two at the local supercharger (myself and that other guy I see almost daily) could be relieved by helping to get our office park, or a few lunch places, big box stores, et cetera to install functioning chargers. Many hotels have them, and are usually nice about non-guests using them, but it feels shitty and aren't near where a resident needs to go anyway.

In the winter in the Midwest, daily supercharging/destination charging is mandatory for many of us or we would be stuck. I don't _want_ to visit a supercharger that is only 25 miles from my house every day but I have to, and it gets damn boring. On the same note supercharger time estimation is way off, so if I leave I have no idea when to go back. Is the app going to not suck all of a sudden so I know when to go move it?

If any of the ones I use were remotely busy I'd make sure the car was moved when it was complete, even though it's a hassle. Maybe I'm a considerate asshole instead of a complete asshole like the ones causing problems. However, the most I've ever seen at once is three total on the thanksgiving return-a-thon. 

Almost all of the superchargers I've been to are in box store or movie theatre parking lots which encourages this behavior anyway. Is that not the case in CA and elsewhere they are having problems?

I guess ultimately I just want to be charged or fined or whatever by supply and demand. I currently live and travel where demand is very low. Why inconvenience myself to avoid inconveniencing no one? 

"
"agreed 100%. Rural UK tesla owner here. I supercharge maybe once a month max, and only when I cant get home without doing so."
"I've heard several times over the past week that SC suspensions should be considered. I suspect that most of this sentiment comes from people who almost exclusively travel in places like the Bay area. Banning people from the SC network for *any* reason cannot ever happen, especially in colder and more rural locations. I can give one perfectly reasonable example.

A family of 5 is traveling east on I-90 after Christmas in a Model X 60D. It's [below freezing](http://imgur.com/a/YmE4x) with light snow, and there's a blizzard forecast for that night. They've planned to make it to the in-laws in Bozeman with time to spare. They hit Superior at lunch time and find a completely empty bank of chargers, so they plug in and head into Durango's for a bite to eat.

Because there are 3 kids and they're needing to wait for their food, go to the bathroom, pay their bill, etc., they get back 35 minutes after their car is fully charged -- again, at a completely empty bank of chargers in the middle of Montana. Nobody is anywhere near to being inconvenienced, and it's ridiculous to expect someone to dash over to the SC station in the freezing snow to unplug and move the car in the middle of trying to get everyone ready.

They hit the road into a headwind. An accident near Huson slows them down by half an hour, and they run the heater to keep everyone from freezing. Under normal circumstances, they have plenty of charge for that. They get to Missoula with 110 miles of range left. The next SC is in Butte, which is 118 miles away.

No problem, they just plug into the (again, completely unoccupied) SC, and... oops, looks like they overstayed their welcome back in Superior! Surprise, that family is now stranded in Missoula! Based on what I'm seeing in PlugShare, there don't appear to be any other EV chargers in Missoula. Regardless, there's a blizzard on its way in about 6 hours, so even if there were, it wouldn't help.

In that situation, I would record a video of the debacle for YouTube, abandon the Model X, rent a gas car to complete the trip, tell my story to the press, tow and sell the Model X, buy a Volvo XC90 T8 Hybrid, and never consider another Tesla again.

Fortunately, Elon has more sense on his shoulders than the many of the posters on threads like this, so he's not going to cut me off from the SC network capriciously and will keep me as a loyal customer."

"I don't like exceptions because they train people into bad habits.  When I drive by a Michigan station, there tends to be a single car, perhaps two, out of eight units.

It would be too easy for the Michigan driver to get into poor habits of leaving the car unattended for hours on end, which would be bad in a busier area.  Imagine that I, as a Michigan driver, am used to deserted superchargers.  I can leave my car there all day if I want to, and no one will ever care because there will never be more than two or three units in use in addition to the one I am currently wasting.  The trouble starts when I go to Chicago and find a nice convenient and almost empty supercharger station at 10:30am.  I plug in at 20%, and go walk around the city and do whatever, coming back at 6 pm to collect my car.  The problem is that 10:30 is a dead time for a lot of things.  It is an off peak travel time, so an off peak charging time.  At 1 PM, someone's ticked off at me for making them wait to use the charger, and more are ticked off at 5 or 6 PM.  Maybe one of those is the sort who will walk off to the convenience store around the block and buy some lunch meat.

Would you rather get a nice notification in the app, that your car is charged and you should move it, followed by a fee if you do not, or come back to find your car covered in salami?"
"Will probably be different once the Model 3 comes out
"
@ElonMusk just announced they will now only charge when the site is full or almost full...
"Definitely this. Elon agrees:
https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/810135528783937537"
That's going to be a pretty hefty bill for some people who didn't realise just how many hours they were spending parked at SCs :D
Tesloop...wonder how they'll be handling this. Leaving overnight would be... 8 hours?... so $192 a night for that alone.  Obviously could vary.
Lol atleast the commuters wont be using it anymore
[deleted]
A self-eject mechanism wouldn't be hard to design.
"The car still has to be unplugged manually (for now), and not all Teslas ever sold have Autopilot. Much less AP2, which is required for fully autonomous driving, such as moving out of a parking spot without human assistance."
That actually would work if they could somehow insure that the charge plug wouldn't damage the car finish as it was dropping out. But more likely they would have to put some kind of robotic arm on it to plug and unplug.
[deleted]
"That ""however"" sounds like perfectly legitimate usage that shouldn't be charged."
"They will charge you at your next service visit: https://www.tesla.com/support/supercharger-idle-fee

> How will I be billed?    
You will be billed for any idle fees incurred at your next Service Center visit.

No software update needed."
"Kind of depends. Most Tesla's can get 50% charge in about 20 minutes. But charging slows down for reasons I'm too lazy to explain, as the battery gets more full. Usually takes about 50-60 minutes. Maybe a touch longer for a full charge (but you hardly ever charge it fully, you usually charge it to around 80-90%)"
"No servicing, no vehicle warranty."
The car knows whether it's moved since being unplugged.
And couldn't a fellow owner just plug them back in?
Yup
Use a watch?
Yeah well shouldnt have bought a tesla then
"Just a guess, but (in theory) Tesla knows when you unplug your car, when you start your car, and when your car moves.

So if it's unplugged, but never started or moved, they could bill you."
well now if you keep it plugged in an extra 10 minutes youll be charged $2. not bad eh.
Isn't that what the coming snake charger is for?
"Honestly I don't agree. If someone is spending 45-60 min to use the restroom, maybe that choice of restroom location was not optimal? That's quite the journey for a restroom break... "
"Just set it for a higher target charge level to buy yourself some more time.  The top 4-5% is REALLY slow at a supercharger unless you have the software-derated (new) 60 car.

If you set an 85 car to charge to 97% instead of 85%, you are probably looking at an extra 30 minutes.  Go for a full charge and you're looking at another 15-45 on top of that (extra half hour if it goes into conditioning and balancing)."
You drive your Tesla abroad?
Exactly!! Should stop all the overnight SC parking BS
"So you stay a bit longer, an hour over the time: $24! now one could argue that's fairly good value parking depending on where you are!

When plugging in surely you have an ETC, so plan accordingly and if one is too inconsiderate to do that, or is held up and unable to move vehicle in time, surely 0.40c is a small price to pay in comparison to the original vehicle itself no? :-)"
[deleted]
"This is what I have been saying, the idea is good, but poorly though-out. People with disabilities and senior should have exemption from this. 
Better yet, make one supercharger stall ADA compliant and closer to store/restaurants and bathroom like the rest of disable parking. "
I hope some day they have an update where you can define your owner profile to indicate your handicap situation and have a longer grace period in your case 
"Most municipalities allow freeHP because it's so difficult for most HP get to where they're going, and it takes much longer to do things like shop (move around in stores, slowly cruise aisles) and they cannot run out to feed meter. They also can park in permitted neighborhoods without specific neighborhood permit. Other municipalities allow double the max time with special meters, so if there's a one hour limit with a meter, the HP spaces have 2-hr max limit. Legal HP placard suffices. Tesla can program HP separately, no? So that even if the charge is complete, it doesn't show for another hour, or even half-hour? Cut people some slack and be grateful you don't need special accomodations, no? This is something Congress might take up if there aren't ""reasonable accomodations made"" for handicap accessinility. It will likely soon be added to the ADA. Hopefully the company has a compliance officer working on this, and maybe help draw up a bill that they can use to to put an addition to the law. 
"
"i don't own a tesla yet, but don't you get a notification on your phone of when the car is almost done charging?"
"Are they Superchargers? If so, that's right. You shouldn't be hogging those, they're for people trying to get places.

If they're L2 chargers, this does not affect those.

When Supercharging, you get a notification on your phone when you get close to full, and another one when you're full. You can also check your estimated remaining charge time at any time."
"You do get notified in the app I think. But still you are right, say you time it exactly and the checkout line gets busy and it takes 10 min to check out, now you gotta pay $8 for parking for 20 min. It's stupid."
"At the gas station it's a five minute deal. If even that long. When charging it takes a bit longer and in a lot of cases the chargers are near restaurants and other things you might want to visit for a half hour. So you park, start charging, and grab lunch. That's a pretty ideal setup. But now you need to be aware of when your charge is complete or you'll be billed. "
Possibly but then what's your benefit? A parking spot?
"Yeah, but you risk that someone plugs your car back in again (you don't need a key to plug a Tesla in)"
"They're preparing the infrastructure for a quintupling of the size of the Tesla fleet. Within a year all spots will be frequently used.

Be happy you are one of the fewer than 100K owners who will ever have free unlimited Supercharging. Nobody ever promised us free parking."
Just a question. So is the parking there always full too or will it be hard to find a parking space normally after you've charged?
"How is 10?  You know the details and charge level, it's your responsibility to pay attention, or pay the price. Not difficult. "
https://www.tesla.com/blog/improving-supercharger-availability
"Legal issues, no way to remove charging cable"
Every two child did I will.
"You can't limit supercharging, because that bypasses the car's onboard charger completely - which is where you would normally set a limit."
"That's how the Tesla app for your smartphone works, you get a notification when your car is close to fully charged. Plus, you can see the charge status all the time, so you should be able to see when it is time to go move your car without the idle timer running. "
"According to the [FAQ](https://www.tesla.com/blog/improving-supercharger-availability), you'll be charged on your next SC visit. They know when your car is hooked up, charging, and whether you've moved it after charging. And they'll know who the car is linked to.

Sooooo I suppose you could just avoid going in for service ever again."
"Also, Since Tesla should have the telemetry to know whether all the stalls are full at a station, why don't they only apply this to stations that are very busy or full? Instead of network wide. "
"To be fair, Disneyland has increased the number of spots recently from 18 to over 60. They are in the middle of each level now, so it isn't considered a premium parking location anymore. Last couple of trips have been super easy to find a spot as the people who don't need it are no longer incentivized to grab those spots.

As an assed bonus, I found out that Apple Pay works on the ChargePoint units, so I don't have to bring that silly card with my anymore!"
"If a Tesla owner bothers stop whatever they're doing to unplug the car, I'm sure they'd move it, $.40/min or not. The issue is owners plugging up and then leaving for hours.  "

Did they charge the parents $24 per hour?
"I don't think the situation is analogous. Parents picking up their kids from daycare aren't going to be outrageously late. It might be 30-60 minutes, typically. Tesla is trying to stop people who leave their cars parked at Superchargers for many hours. $24/hour for several hours is probably a lot more expensive than whatever ""small fine"" these daycares charged."
That experiment with fines for being late is exactly what I thought of when I saw this. This is perhaps just an experiment as well.
Once again why are you charging for every day errands? 
"I dunno. I'm pretty motivated to not spend $24/hour on parking, regardless of the cost of my car. I didn't get $100k to spend on a car by wasting money."
"It's hideous, $24/hr.  I drive Audis, BMWs, and Cadillacs, and can't stand $3-4/hr city lot parking."
"Honestly that's $576/day ... if someone is willing to give that kind of money to Tesla to park at an SC, fine. I'm ok with that knowing that they're giving Tesla a solid amount of money to do so"
"$24/hour is an ultra-premium rate nearly everywhere. The number of people who would be willing to pay that much just so they don't have to move their car a small distance away will be small, and if they exist at all they'll help pay for the system the rest of us use."
What if Tesla started pulling energy back out of the pack after 10-15 min of idle time? That would get some people running back to their cars.

It starts five minutes after it is full. 
"From almost dead, a half charge will take at most half an hour, unless you are sharing the charger with another car.  If you have your own charger, you will have at least 60% charge in half an hour.  The official number is ""up to 170 miles in 30 minutes"", but it can be slightly higher with the larger battery packs and newer chargers.  An hour should have you not less than 80% charge in any of the higher capacity cars.  The rest of that will take up to an hour to complete.

Basically, charging is fastest in the bottom 60% of the battery capacity, then charges at a lower and lower rate the higher it goes.  My personal observation with a P85 was basically a rule of 65% until the charging rate falls to a certain amount.  Half an hour to 65%, then half an hour for 65% of the balance (87.75% net), then half an hour for 65% of the balance still (net about 96%) and then half an hour more for the balance.  If it goes into a lengthy balancing aka finishing/completing charge, it could be a while longer.  This was an unscientific observation.

Youtube user KmanAuto has a video of a full charge on an 85.  It is not time compressed, but you can scan through it or increase playback speed.  It will give you an idea.

I thought he had a time compressed supercharging video, must be someone else.

">How long does it take to charge a tesla car fully? I have no idea, we are talking about what, couple of hours? 

Usually about 20-30 minutes of charging to get you enough juice to make it to the next Supercharger (2-3 hours of driving)"
"This is not possible. How could you tell that all the chargers are occupied by the time your car is charged?

And if they are suddenly then you would have to rush to your car in the middle of your lunch. People would complain that it is not fair, the they were far away from the charger, that the notification came late, etc...

It needs to be a simple clear rule."
One day
"Elon has said recently that they will upgrade most or all of the supercharger locations with the autoplug hardware. He didn't give an exact time frame but it is coming.

The blog today also specifically mentions that cars will be able to drive away in the future (presumably AP2 or newer required)."
you get notified 
I guess that's exactly what they are trying to prevent. You are not supposed to leave the car there overnight. 
"Hotels have destination chargers. If you are at a supercharger go check in, get your room ready, jump in the shower, move your car or just wake up in the morning and charge before you leave. "
A supercharger is fast enough that you don't need to sleep while it's charging.
"I doubt folks would walk out, unplug their car and leave it in the stall, then walk back in. That's just asking for trouble from other owners. 

I honestly think this will work quite well. It's expensive enough where it will keep people from overnighting (huge issue in LA and California in general) and reduce the amount of idling. In general there's a ton of it right now "
Move the car after it charges.  
"Does not apply to destination chargers. You shouldn't be parking in a supercharger spot overnight. Why is this so hard to understand? Are we that self absorbed that we don't think of our fellow man/woman who are also Tesla
Owners?"
Wealthy people don't get wealthy by not caring about throwing their money away at stupid things :)
"I think it will be effective. Wealthy folks care about their money and don't become wealthy by wasting $576 / day on parking, which would be the case here. "
"> In other words, is there any way to keep assholes from blocking the space while not charging?

Yes, send out the tow truck. Or you could do what someone else suggested:  plug them back in.. 8 cars, 8 hour=$1,536 a night.
"
"This will primarily discourage companies that have *fleets* of Tesla vehicles that they leave plugged into superchargers overnight (such as Tesloop or other taxi services). $200 per vehicle per night, yeah that'll hurt."
Grace period is 5 minutes. 
That will have a significant financial hit to companies like Tesloop that leave a fleet of cars parked and plugged in *overnight* on a regular basis. And they've been one of the biggest offenders. That works out to $200 per car to park overnight.
Tesla will also know whether or not you've started or moved your car after unplugging. That could be a factor.
"I think they could do something like waive the fee if the charging station is less than half full. 75% of the times I've supercharged, I've been the only car there (southeast). The ""parking"" problem is definitely more of a problem in some areas than others, especially California.

*edit* Heeyyyyy looks like Elon [read my post.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/810135528783937537) Yes, I'll take credit for that, you all can thank me."
"It's 24 an hour, I don't think they charge that at the airport. It'd be cheaper to park overnight in a handicapped spot and pay the fine and towing fee, lol."
"Of course it is to penalize those who don't move.  At that ($.4/min) rate, there will be a lot of extra money to fund the expansion of the network from people who don't move their cars.

Some more progressive cities that have free EV charging use fines and fees for ticketing and/or towing conventionally fueled vehicles parked in charging spaces, to pay for the expansion of public charging.  According to one of the people I know who works for the city in Ann Arbor, MI, that's one of the reasons they still put EV spaces in somewhat more desirable locations.  According to him, it significantly increases ticket revenue, which directly pays for the maintenance and expansion of charging."
"Yeah that's a good point. I can't complain about that honestly. Although if there were only 1-2 Superchargers in LA, I think starting a roadtrip from LA would be stressful. There would be crazy lines. "
Yet all our superchargers are pretty packed and often you wait in line for a very long time. Honestly we could use one in the west valley too for those of us who do a lot of errands and find we're pretty spent by the time we come over the hill and have to gamble on if we can make it home on our charge or if we go way out of the way in the opposite direction to Burbank. 
When it takes 49 minutes to crawl two exits in the freeway you need a few extra locations 
I've read rumors here that they were leaving their cars at the Superchargers overnight. 
time for mag safe adapters!
"Where would it go though? And yeah, I know it's an old comment."
"Near big cities, it's a huge issue. Lots of cars parked overnight etc"
It's not ridiculous at all. It's desperately needed in higher populated areas. 
Living in Michigan I'm curious where r the super chargers located?
[deleted]
or maybe it will max out after X minutes...
"I think as long the customer can provide them documentation proving he had an emergency, it's okay to wave the fee. Otherwise people will need an insurance of its own to charge in superchargers"
"I'm glad there is a distinction between full superchargers. We often get back to the car ten to fifteen min after charging is done on long trips. And there isn't the same overcrowding problem here in the Midwest. So one less thing to stress about.

"
"If they care, yeah. 

But just look at how current parking and traffic tickets are doled out in America. It's a set fee. They don't care if a ticket comes out to be pocket change or if it means forcing a person to decide whether they pay their bills/rent that month or stay out of jail. 

They might just assume that if you can afford a Tesla you can afford the fines. "
Some people have two Teslas
"Takes 20 minutes for 50%, 40 minutes for 80%, and 75 for 100%."
"My heart says understanding, but my gut isn't too certain."
Just unplug it.  They wouldnt know
">Would they be understanding and wave the fee or would they be sorry you're SOL?

I don't see why they wouldn't waive the fee if you have documentation to prove why you couldn't move your car (like medical emergency). Even your local city government will (most likely) waive your parking fees if you appeal it and have proof of an ER visit. Of course not every excuse will work."
"Example story: 

A person has a heart attack after leaving her Tesla charging and is moved to a hospital for a few days. She racks up medical bills. Then she discovers that she got higher idle fees on her Model S than her medical bills. Has a new heart attack."
They have no reason to be strict.
"My guess is that they won't actually fine anyone, and the prevention associated with the threat of it is enough to convince people to move on when charged.

My apartment's parking area has 'visitor' parking and it was being abused by people who worked in the city. They put up permit signs, saying you needed someone from the apartments to give you one in order to be allowed to stay.

They didn't exist at all: it was just a preventative measure and it worked. People saw the signs and didn't risk getting clamped or towed."
"In a life changing situation like that I wouldn't give a shit about whatever fees my car racked up, I'd just be happy things turned out. That is such an off chance situation, I'm sure if that ever happened there could be special circumstances for reliving payment. "
lol if I had to leave my car in a paid parking lot because of an emergency the lot owner wouldn't give a fuck. You have to suck it up and pay in these situations.
"If the driver has a heart attack, who's to say the car won't just drive to the hospital?"
"You're working hard to come up with edge cases here. Consider the fact that the overwhelming majority of people leaving their car at the charger aren't kidnapped, murdered, or having a heart attack. So, this plan solves for the overwhelming majority abusing the system.

This means the edge cases can easily be handled on a case by case basis. I'm quite sure Tesla wouldn't take the bad press of charging a heart attack survivor (or their surviving family?) for parking. A simple phone call is all it takes."
"I'm still waiting for Tesla to send me whatever agreement I signed dictating the terms of supercharging, autopilot and OTA updates when I bought the car. They use vertical integration to it's max: ""take it or fuck off."""
"My guess. They will send you a bill, and if you don't pay it, you won't get supercharging anymore."
That's a great point. I just wonder why the company decided on $0.40/minute
"It was.  We saw the idle time fee listed in the MyTesla page code several months ago already when we first saw the fee for charging on the page (hidden, but in the code)"
Yet we can't get a media player that works.
"Yeah, I figured as much too, given there's been a number of Supercharger-related positions on Tesla's site over the past few months that likely played a role in this. "
"I lived with someone who worked at Tesla on their web development team. Once friday night he got a phone call and had to head in- someone had tweeted at Elon that their website was broken on an ancient version of the facebook browser on iphones (seriously, this phone was like four years without an update applied to it) and Elon promised they'd fix it that night."
The car and the smartphone app will both give you an estimated time until charging is complete.
[deleted]
you will also know in advance approximately how much time it will take to get to you planned charge.  therefore one can plan accordingly.  
You don't have to run. You can leave wherever you are earlier. 
"You have an app that gives you a great estimate of when your charge will be complete. If you wait until the charge is done before you start going to retrieve your car that's a problem in scheduling, not motility."
..... But you know how much time is left on the charger? Are you serious. . 
Having N min notification from the app will solve it. 
What's your disability?
"Seriously this is the exact type of stuff I feel like they can set up to be different for you.  I don't know that but it's possible.

They may also give you some credits.  I would pursue this."
"You don't have to go faster to get there. You just have to be more responsible and start heading back 5 minutes earlier. Why should the charger modify its timer to accommodate you, when you're the one who has the ability to make complex decisions and grasp context? "
Leave 10 min early and not 5?
Why are you playing the disability card?  Its not like the car reaching full charge is coming as a surprise to you.  Your disability is completely irrelevant.
"I agree 100%, this is completely ignoring people with disabilities. It is bad enough that parking is so far away from everything."
The app tells you when you are almost finished charging as well - roughly 10 min prior
"It wasn't designed to make your life convenient and let you charge your car while you eat dinner. The use case you presented is officially ""part of the problem"".

Think of it as a gas pump. Would you go eat dinner while your car sits in front of a gas pump? Granted the time scale is completely different but the intention is identical: use it and step aside so others can use it too."
"Also what if your restaurant actually cooperates with tesla to allow some of the businesses parking slots be used for charging? Think I even remember sth like ""electricity provided by.."". They can't be happy with customers having to rush out of the shop within 5min... wonder wether there will be different rules/arrangements for different charging locations."
"> now I gotta pay $4 dollars extra just because I'm 10 minutes late?

Why did you go out late?

Go out, move the car, come in finish your food.

My god, it's bloody magic."
[deleted]
"If the chargers were all full and the person preventing you from charging, forcing you to just sit and wait for who knows how long was only being charged 40¢ a minute it would feel like that wasn't enough.

If they only charged you when all the stalls were taken it should be $2 a minute, not 40¢."
">  Say i'm charging and go to have a meal and I plan to be done in time but the food comes out slower and the waitress is just not coming back with my credit card, now I gotta pay $4 dollars extra just because I'm 10 minutes late? 

And now you're one step closer to realizing what it's like to be a poor person living in a country that has set fees instead of percentage based fines. 

Except that you can probably afford the measly four buck charge and won't be sent to jail for failure to pay. 
"
">  now I gotta pay $4 dollars extra just because I'm 10 minutes late?

Oh no! And here you are, buying a $100,000 car, but you can't afford $4. Sorry dude. "
"Exactly. Plus, their phone and car will tell them. So claiming you had no idea would be BS"
"Also, they don't really care about the money. "
Well I mean if they genuinely didn't get notified then they shouldn't have to pay the first time. I guess the car will have a TOS update on the dash that you'll have to agree with? If not then the driver will have no idea.
"Additionally, they can have the vehicles force a message on the in vehicle screens stating a serious EULA change that MUST be read with regard to supercharging IDLE time."
It will be interesting to see how this works out. Tesla would be in breach of contact and as far as I can see Tesla does not have a contact about these fees with current owners. Will be fun with all the different jurisdictions ;)
"Either way if the debt is not wiped, it's potentially a good way to get a super discounted Tesla. 

Buyer: ""Looks like you have $25,000 in supercharger fees... You didn't tell me about that. I guess you'll be knocking that off of your asking price, eh?"" "
So Tesla will divulge the current bill to someone claiming to be a potential buyer of a car? Generally debts against a property are recorded somewhere a potential buyer can identify them (such as right on the title for a car loan). I can't think of another place that debts accrue against a specific car instead of the owner.
This is how I thought it would work. Having to pay in person seems very outdated in this day and age...
Charged for free
"Classic reddit. If someone is wealthy, fuck em!"
"If the lack of a $0.40/minute charge was the only thing making a Tesla EV more desirable than an ICE vehicle, how sad for you."
"yes.  Some people are total schmucks at busy gas stations, parking at pumps for 15 minutes or more to go in the store to shop, use the restroom, and buy coffee and a sandwich."
Yea it all seems rushed and impulsive. If gas took 2 hours you can be damn sure people would leave the gas pump lol.
"A pretty ridiculous statement considering many people sit at the pump and do their convenience shopping, coffee, snacks, light groceries, fast food, and waiting in the check-out line. Can take several minutes. Bad analogy, falls apart. You could argue in that case people are paying for the privilege of staying at pump by buying stuff (and the gas), but then the demand is clearly there to place convenience vendors at the charging stations. Loitering is connected to business. If they want to stop loitering, they have to make people engage in transactions to justify."
"Tow truck is a good place to start, but you're right; Can't get rid of all the dicks out there."
I think a more effective way is to start TAKING charge from the battery after 5 minutes. Then the dick will arrive to a car with an empty battery.
Jokes on you my car doesn't have a charging port
[deleted]
People are lazy and selfish :/
Because if you can people will do it.
Maybe because there isn't other parking available?
That's true. I wonder if they'll implement such a system
Source?
lol I don't even own a Tesla I was just wondering. Does towing ever actually happen?
"Then make it a blanket rule like it is now, but only enforce it when needed."
"The tesla app could notify you that the supercharger has reached a certain threshold, and that the fee will apply. "
"It seems like a pretty straightforward line, draw it at the point at which it inconveniences others. If there's a SC with 8 slots and only 7 are full, nobody should get charged for being idle. As soon as that 8th slot fills up, everyone that's full should start being charged at that moment (and get a notification to move.)"
[deleted]
"I saw your comment you labeled yourself as a rant earlier (before it was deleted). You mentioned going to the mall from a specific supercharger for a bathroom break and food takes longer than 30 minutes.

Maybe consider that the 40 cents a minute fee begins once you've reached 100%. Although most people only charge to a fraction of that to reach their next station, 20-40minutes, a 100% charge takes upwards of two hours. I think it'll be fine. Spending more than a couple hours at a supercharger does seem really excessive. "
I think the only way real laziness is from people who cannot be bothered to move their vehicles in a timely manner. 
"I don't think you get the point. The problem is, they aren't. Even if they are, move your dang car!"
This is great! Personally I would hate the idea that I'm parked somewhere wasting a spot and someone is trying to get home. But I would also be annoyed being in sight of the car in a restaurant and having to move it immediately when it's otherwise empty.
"With enough pumps, it stops being a problem:

Good guy Elon to the rescue. 
"Even without the ""adjustment"" it would help with congestion at chronically full superchargers.  It doesn't matter how long it takes to charge (and most supercharger stops aren't really that long anyway), if you leave your car there after it's done you're making matters worse."
"Well that's good. You see because on a world where you didn't buy the supercharger but feel entitled to use it for free for as long as you want isn't right.  You would actively choose to not participate in that world which is universally accepted. Now take your 60k electric car and charge it at home where you OWN your charging station. 
"
Well I doubt you would ever buy one so why are you here again?
do u not abide by your job's arbitrary rules? idiot 
">Would you rather get a nice notification in the app, that your car is charged and you should move it, followed by a fee if you do not, or come back to find your car covered in salami?

Overnight they need rent dedicated parking spot when destination chargers somewhere.
"$7500 you mean? Because 75k is 75,000. "

"But it will keep them from being charged.  The top 10% is slow, and the top 5% or so on the 85 and 90 cars is REALLY slow, especially if it goes into its balancing and conditioning thing."
">No software update needed

They'll need some way of notifying the users of this change though otherwise it's not really fair if i'm suddenly being given a $1k bill for something I've never been billed for before. The car software update could include a TOS agreement with an update that you have to accept before you drive or something. No other company can just change their TOS and have you agree to it without telling you and making sure you know."

"You need a keyfob to access the charger port, if I'm not mistaken"
Plus of course there is the GPS data which shows exactly where your car is. 
"5 min is absurd, what if the waitress is late with your bill, what if you had to find a bathroom or wait in line for one. You spent 80k on a that drives itself for convenience, then get charged up the ass cause you had to take a shit at at an inopportune time? That's BS."
"Or don't, and set a good example by vacating your spot promptly so that the Model 3 launch doesn't cause the Tesla charging network to collapse from overcrowding."

"For me personally, I don't mind much, but for the average Tesla owner, let's be honest -- they're rabid about having to pay for anything extra."
"Agreed, if they build in a warning system that alerts the user at a time that is ""x"" minutes before charge is complete and that can be pre programmed by the user, then that would make more sense for the disabled."
"The whole thing is that these are **not** parking spaces. They don't need a handicap version, it takes hours to fully charge the cars no one has to run anywhere "
"*It's not a parking spot*.

If getting back to the spot is going to be a problem, just stay with the car for the (sometimes much) less than an hour it takes to supercharge and then go park in a handicapped spot that's convenient to whatever you want to do."

That would be nice.

"Don't always shop while waiting, but if I need to run errands I might as well go to the stores with a supercharger since I need to do that too. Until the temp goes back up I have to supercharge every day to make it back home unless I'm lucky enough that the charger at my office isn't blocked by something else."
Yeah agreed. 
How much does it cost if you have your car towed from a gas station if you leave it for an hour at the pump? 
"24 hour parking is likely an extreme use case. I can
 imagine a majority will be a few hours, the thought will be, oh since we're paying anyway, we have really no incentive to move the car right away, just need a couple more hours to finish my venti mocchaccino in this warm coffee shop."
"A good way might be to double the fine for every 100 minutes of idling you paid per year. It would get ridiculously expensive very quickly for ""rich assholes""."
"Yes but I was just pointing out anything that could be an issue. For known offenders seems like tesla would penalize them. 

In small towns like mine, Burlington, nc where availability to charge is pretty much me and one other person I don't think they should see penalties.

Or have it but do something like this:

for high trafficked areas + weekends seems when this pricing thing could be more useful. 

I'm just a guy who cant walk great who might like to eat and 15-20 minutes of it is wasted walking to eat.

"At the Greenville South Carolina supercharger, the nearest place to eat is Whole Foods which is a quick 5-minute jog from the supercharger.

Maybe I'm overthinking this."
"Exactly, it's not an incentive. It's a penalisation.

An incentive does not cost the recipient if they don't meet requirements but rewards them if they do.

A penalisation costs the recipient if they don't meet the requirements, and does not reward them if they do.

So therefor they are making wrong use of the words to try and put a positive spin on it as incentive to me is a positive word, but in fact it's to penalise which to mean has a more negative sound."
"But if you're starting in LA, then you're supposed to fill up the car at your own house, right? Why would you use a supercharger for that?"
"Precisely my point - Angelenos are using LA superchargers, not just San Franciscans on their way to San Diego and the like. Which is totally fine - they are, as you point out, useful for getting around LA, and so their density and crowdedness reflect the population of LA, not just travel through LA. 

I'm just arguing that in the long run, Tesla needs urban superchargers to serve local trips as well as through-trips, because urban areas have  people who rely on street parking and because autonomous vehicles in the Tesla fleet could drive over 200 miles in a day without leaving the area. 

Making sure people don't use charging stalls as free parking is an essential step to having useful urban superchargers. "
I've seen them at culver City numerous times in the wee hours of the morning (2-3am) parked there with no one in the car. 
Not rumors. I talked to their driver at Culver City SC and she admitted that they park their cars at SC overnight.
Nearest empty parking space? Back to the owner (later if it can).
"That only encourages people to try to predict whether or not they'll prevent people from using the charger and whether or not they'll get away with it. The goal here isn't to create an appropriate punishment, it's to keep the chargers unblocked."
"I concur. I drive up and down the east coast several times, and I have yet to see a supercharger that's been even close to being full (the closest I've seen is JFK with only one open stall left). It would suck to screw over all these people who weren't inconveniencing anyone."

Couldn't they have a system that monitors how many of the station are being used?
Supercharger in the boondocks huh.
Well said 
"> But on second thought, you can't algorithmically calculate how many people are being held up

You can do it empirically. Raise the idle fee until either waiting times are sufficiently low or a slot opens up. It should be just above the market price of parking.

---

Tesla can also charge ICE cars this same fee to earn some additional revenue."
They could totally use surge pricing. If Uber and Lyft can do it so can Tesla. 
You can't count how many be just drove on by because they saw the spot was taken.
"> The price should float on if the Tesla is holding up a long line vs if it's sitting in the middle of the boondocks with empty slots available. Someone's going to get a 10 dollar fee for ""parking too long"" and they will be the only car there

I mean, that's not really any different than parking a regular car in a lot past your paid time and getting a ticket; it doesn't matter if the lot is empty, you're there longer than you have a right to be, so you get ticketed."
Good news. Tesla will be taking [availability](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/810135528783937537) into account.
[deleted]
He said that there won't be a charge if there are open spots. 
[Seems that's exactly how it's going to work. ](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/810135528783937537)
"You're missing the point.  Point here is these are NOT parking spaces. They are charging spaces, whether anyone is waiting or not. You don't park your gas car at a gas pump do you? 

The spaces are for ""fueling up"" only. Reach full charge and move Immediately.  

I'll also add that ""rich people"" are rich for a reason, most of them got that way by being frugal. The wealthiest people I know are the cheapest. ""Rich"" people will hate being charge .40 cents a minute more than a poor person (which don't drive Teslas anyways). "
People who own Tesla are already rich
"Per the FAQ:

> Is there an upper limit on the idle fee?
No, idle fees will continue to accrue if the car is not moved within five minutes after the charge session is complete."
"I doubt Tesla want to take the time to look through your medical documentation. It's easier for them, and happier for you, if they give you a couple of freebies a year, at their discretion. If you beg an emergency every week, they'll just bill you. "
Yeah so set a timer. 
"Exactly. 

All in all this is a rather large change so a fairly small problem (that will get bigger and bigger as the fleet grows) but also seemingly doesn't have any other rules set yet. But it does sound like Elon, there is a problem here is a solution. The rest comes later but hopefully the over sight and conditions are added and that they'll err on the lenient side of things.

Then again they may just be waiting out till they can have them auto disconnect and park themselves elsewhere. But that is still a bit far off tech-wise (ask them they say sooner rather than later) and even further off legality-wise."
"itd probably be on a ""per incident"" policy. but they probably would wave it for something like that but dont want to publicize it much. "
I thought the issue was people bringing them to charge and not coming back until long after it finishes.  If they were to come back to unplug the charger why wouldn't they just leave with it.
In a car that's a smartphone on wheels? I'm sure they know every statistic about the car at any time (if there's a phone signal). 
"If people can, they will."
That won't work. The car has to be driven after charging to stop the charging fee timer.
The car might.
They would not know the location of a car with a GPS receiver and always-on Internet connectivity? Of course they would be able to know that your car is still standing at the supercharger.
I'll plug you back in. 
Security cameras?
That's part of the point though right now. We're relying on their goodwill. As far as the public is aware there is nothing they have set in the rules about exceptions or understanding. We only know what is in that press release. They could be as strict as they want to. It's something to keep an eye on as instances like my example start to occur. It'll likely all be about precedence.
"In 20 years sure. Tomorrow, no."
There is likely some fine print for autopilot and updates. It explicitly tells you autopilot is in its testing phase. I'm pretty sure free supercharging was never a part of the sale even if its become a selling point for some people... there aren't nearly enough chargers available to qualify it as part of the product. +-150 mile gap between many chargers.
"In German law, it would be ""konkludent"", i.e. you knew and accepted it when buying the car. "
"That's $210,000 for a year a parking. Long-term, I think that's enough to disuade anyone who would offend repeatedly, while still acceptable in emergencies like someone goes to the hospital and leaves their car in the charger. Not enough to harm you, but too much inconvenience to accept.

Example: at 2 minutes a day left in the charger (while someone gets coffee and just ignores it) that's ~$300 per year. I wouldn't pay that extra if I could easily avoid it. "
"Start small but increase the fee if people continue to be assholes. 
This way it's clear that they are not trying to do this to make profit but simply as a monetary reminder that you're being rude. "
"Pretty incredible, as its just linux, theoretically anyone could port hundreds of media players to the Tesla"
Is there an Android app?
Sweet!  That's pretty nifty.
"Hehe, this is true."
great. good idea. totally always going to do this. even if I know I need to charge to 100%
"This is not a viable solution, people with disabilities should not have to jump thru hoops to avoid being charged."
[deleted]
"I wonder if it can give you alerts on your phone, i.e. ""30 minutes until charging complete... 15 minutes.... 5 minutes... Charging complete... Idle fee now applicable"" etc."
This was never the problem. The jerks who hog a spot are the problem. They're just going to unplug and sit there or change to 100%.
"Not all disabilities are so predictable, dude shouldn't have specify either.  "
"Eh, what I'm worried about is being stuck in a restaurant waiting for the bill. 

That being said, I've also only supercharged to full, like, twice."
"Okay so say it takes 15 mintues to walk to to a location. You get there. The car says it will take 50mins to an hour. The only things around is shopping and a restaurants  on the far side of the area. You go in to eat, wait to be seated take order now it it's been another 10 minutes you are about to eat then your car alerts you, you have 10 minutes you leave go pick up your car takes 15 minutes. You're charged for the 5 minutes you were away. Drive to location get out of car go back in to finish meal with my family who I'm sure finished.

The only thing I can think of is wait to charge, eat then wait another hour in my car while charging. "
"Long story short my bone are brittle and weak, plus I have arthritis of a 60+ year old man in a 30 year old body. The best way to describe it is feels like magneto is trying to pull all the metal out of my body all the time. It weaken my knee joints and ankle wrist elbows and more. Still kind of a long story lol."
Sure.
"Since when do people with Disabilities require more than two hours to get back to their cars?
I don't even understand your complaint about it being far away from everything? What exactly do you expect Tesla to do in this situation?
Super Chargers are not parking spots FOR the amenities they're near. If you need a handicapped spot for a gas station or mall, then use the Handicapped spots assigned to those locations."
"I mean, they've started putting super chargers in the parking lots of chain restaurants. Pretty clearly intended as a space to park while you go eat dinner. "
"> It wasn't designed to make your life convenient and let you charge your car while you eat dinner. 

That's actually exactly how long wait times for charging on longer trips were defended: You will stop somewhere to eat anyway. Look at Björns videos, getting food while charging all the time. And some owners of 100k cars might prefer a nice restaurant over fast food.

> Think of it as a gas pump. 

That doesn't make sense to compare. Gas pump takes a few minutes, Supercharger takes far longer so it makes sense to go away from the car and do something in that time."
"I didn't present that case, Tesla did. https://www.tesla.com/supercharger  <- step 2 'Charge'. If gas took two hours I sure would not wait in the car for 2 hours either. The problem is people leaving the cars overnight or all day. Not people being 20 minutes late. This is harsh and unnecessary, especially now that the number of cars is low. It's a drastic impulsive measure to solve a pretty rare problem."
That's the destination charging program. Not the supercharging program.
"Exactly, is the restaurant going to start comping Tesla fees if your food is late? People don't pay 80k for a car to put up with this nickel and dime BS."
"Really, i gotta put on my gloves and coat, and let my food get cold to go move my car when it's ready? You gotta be joking. People will not move and just argue the fees when they visit the center. This won't do shit other than aggravate people; and stop what it needs to which is overnight parkers. But that could have been done in a much better way."
That would have been an awesome solution :)
"Yes, if that was the case I would gladly pay $5 per minute because at that point I'm actually wasting someone else's time and need to pay for it."
"Not about can afford, it's about the principle."
"Does the car give the same notifications the phone does? Cause while most Tesla owners have smart phones not all of them will, or will have the app. So that would also go into how the delivery of that notification is. If it's something easy to miss versus something obvious and clear."
So they say:)
"> Tesla would be in breach of contact and as far as I can see Tesla does not have a contact about these fees with current owners. 

I'm sure by using these freely offered charging stations, you are agreeing to the terms just by using them. "
"Is a contract necessary? Tesla owns the superchargers and can run them as they see fit, can't they? An idle fee wouldn't violate the free charging promise. 

I'm asking because I really don't know. My idea was to just not let them use the charger if they have an outstanding fee. But then there'd need to be a mechanism for a person to pay at any place so they don't get stranded."
Also Teslas being towed because they run out of power would be bad press for Musk.
[deleted]
"The only people getting fucked are the ones that need to charge when the stall is blocked. The fee needs to be high enough to dissuade Tesla owners,  who are likely to have higher income. "
"If someone thinks their money makes them better people than those without, definitely ""fuck 'em"". "
stat class musk be hard for you
"If someone is wealthy they won't feel 0.40$/minute anyway. This is just a step to make chargers more available since People seem to basically claim them for and unnecessary amount of time. If you can't plan your day, event with the app notifications, then just take the bill... I don't see a problem with that."
"I'll leave my car while it's filling up if I need something inside and/or have to go to the bathroom. Usually the wait is the line to check out and if that's the case the gas station is doing it to themselves by not having more registers open. 

Now if people were to go to dinner and leave their car at the pump that's another thing. "
Yes but you still move the car when it's done. 
"You would think so, but Tesla has been reluctant to tow charger blockers so far."
But then he's stuck there. So you exacerbate the problem. 
[deleted]
Yes. 
"Yes, it will. It's kind of annoying as my wife's Tesla opens when I go to charge mine. "
Highly accurate GPS on board along with all the Autopilot hardware so I bet they can pinpoint when you're in a Tesla charger parking spot even if you're not plugged in. 
That's a bit of a stretch.
Like now? :)
"True, but doesn't work with notificyikns on mobile (I am android)."
"But then it's too late. People are already waiting. Not a fan of that, it's not clear enough. "
"Yeah, I realize that.  Pretty cool that Tesla picked up on it and made the adjustment."
I saw that comment too (before he deleted it). My suggestion: maybe walking a mile to use the restroom isn't an optimal choice? /u/sciencetyman 
"It runs a fine line. If it was like gas and filled in 5 minutes tops, of course you'd expect people to wait. At 2 hours people are going to do something else while it charges, and it's a major pain in the ass to do things with a time limit over your head. People aren't paying 80k for a car to be on the car's schedule. If you don't time things perfectly maybe you eat for an hour and then can't do anything else because it will take longer than an hour, or you do something that could take 2 hours and if you are even a bit late you gotta pay a lot of money. It's absurd."
[deleted]
[deleted]
Agreed. This guy is just finding things to complain about. 
"Well, that will never happen in NY metro area for one.

And for two, still doesn't remove the inconsiderate facet of using a filling/charging slip as a parking spot."
"You’re right. What I meant to say (but didn’t) was that it’s non-issue then for *responsible* drivers: you have plenty of time then to have a meal, come back and still wait for the car to finish charging. And that it therefore won’t help, because most owners are already there waiting to move the car a.s.a.p. Of course, that spectacularly misses that the whole reason for this change in the first place is that there *are* irresponsible morons out there :("
"Yes, because the arbitrary rules were clearly defined when I applied and accepted their offer. And if they implemented arbitrary rules I didn't like (say, making people wear uniforms or do the chicken dance every day at 9:02) I would quit and find somewhere that didn't have those rules. 

Tesla is pulling the rug out from under their owners and slapping them with fees for things that may not impact anyone else. The fee should only be implemented in cases where the SC station is nearly full."
"And destructive.

Many lunch meat sausages have the potential to eat car paint if left on the vehicle for a while, especially if the car surface is hot.  This is true of salami, bologna, pepperoni, and possibly other sausage style deli meats.  I learned about it back in high school, and have seen cases of its effects.  It does work better on non clearcoat, enamel style finishes, though it still does work on newer car paints if left for a couple of hours or more."
$160-200 a night is pretty steep. I'd hope that forces them to move their cars. I'm honestly so tired of seeing Tesloop cars hogging spots all night.. 
The solution is to price charging by electricity used and time as well.
[deleted]
Short answer: current vehicles are grandfathered into free charging for life; cars purchased after Dec 31 will have to pay per kWh
Will any keyfob work? Or is it set specifically to your car?
"So you're 5 min late, and you pay $1.50 to Tesla so they can build more Superchargers. I'm happy to do that. But honestly I've never had that issue, I'm always at my car before it hits 100%"
The app tells you already 10+ min prior that your charging is almost done. You essentially have 15+ mins from first notification 
"How have you managed to handle parking meters? No matter how much your car costs, you're still risking a ticket if you stay past expiration. "
"Then you pay $0.40... I don't think it's BS at all, it's great. If I run late to moving my car from the charger and it costs me a couple dollars, o well. I'm essentially donating to Tesla. And I'm always back in my Model S before it hits 100% anyway. "
"My point is that if you absolutely need the extra time, at least it is going to a good use.  Would you rather have a vehicle charging slowly or simply doing nothing?  Obviously you shouldn't use methods like this to enable longer stays at busy stations where the space may be needed.  During off hours or in little used locations, there isn't in any harm in being there an extra half hour.

To use some examples in my state:  if you wanted to park for an extra half hour by doing a more complete battery charge in Cadillac, MI, or even in Ann Arbor, MI, you would basically be doing the network a favor anyway by doing more of your charging when you are still off of the busy cross-country corridor.  The alternative would be more charging in Toledo, Gary, or any of the Chicago area locations, all of which are a lot busier than Michigan superchargers."
"Aha. You were correct, then, and I was being US-centric. Here in the States it's hard to drive a car to a place where you're out of US coverage. Most of our cell plans cover Canada and Mexico."
"> It takes hours to fully charge

Um... No. That's the whole point of a supercharger - it takes less than an hour to charge."
"I wouldn't, because I'm neither handicapped nor a douchebag."
"Yep, indeed. If you're local, you'd probably just want to park in a regular spot."
[deleted]
App already says you are almost done 10-15 mins prior. Argument moot
"Well I understand his point, if he's sitting in a restaurant eating or in a movie, that's very inconvenient and something else to worry about.  For me, it would mean that I wouldn't do the charging unless I really needed it, and/or wouldn't worry about it too much and pay a little extra if needed.  "
"Fortunately, Musk seems to have come to his senses and said this will only apply if the site is mostly occupied. "
Sounds like no magic bands at Disneyland. My Magic Plus will mostly be phone based on the west coast. Apparently it is all in flux but from what I hear Team Disney Anaheim wants nothing to do with the bands.
"The linked article describes theirs as ""a small fine."" So I don't think it was the same magnitude as yours. I bet $120/hour works a lot better at convincing people to show up on time."
"I have no idea.  I would assume this is fairly expensive.  Usual towing rates in my area for an unwelcome vehicle (or one that has overstayed its welcome) on private property tend to be in the $100-150 range.

I haven't seen an hour before, but I have seen someone sit down to eat at a McDonald's in the station building.  One of the gas station attendants actually walked into the McDonald's area and told the person that leaving his car at a pump while he ate lunch wasn't acceptable.  The man seemed surprised.  :-/"
"Ha, well, in that case I'm still ok with it because they're basically donating to Tesla every minute so we can have more Superchargers. "
"Yeah, but think of it this way: they will be paying for more superchargers to be installed."
Or start pulling energy back out of the pack after 15 minutes of idle time.
How far is the next supercharger?
"I'm sure there are people who just have that kind of money to not care, but I think the top comment was implying that most Tesla owners are at that level of wealth. A lot of people are barely able to afford a Tesla and 40 cents per minute isn't something they'd just throw away for convenience."
"Yea, i'm not sure about that. From the few wealthy people I know, they watch where their money is going much more than you'd expect. Saving is earning."
Sometimes don't have enough energy left to get to the next SC on a trip 
I think Elon has so many super chargers here because of SoCal driving culture. I've got a 60D and I've done a lot of driving down in south OC today visiting my family. I'll be heading back up to my house in the west valley this evening and will likely hit fountain valley or Culver City on the way back. I've got 68 miles left on my battery so I won't make it back home without super charging since home is 75 miles north. 
"Pretty difficult to know where every parkingplace in the world is though. And know which ones are clear. And pay the parking fee automatically. And what if the owner has no charge on their phone? How will they know where their car is, in a decently timely manner."
"But by having only a flat rate, they are prevented from penalizing people more when chargers are in high demand. Someone who leaves their car charged for an hour in an empty Supercharger will be dinged the same amount as someone who leaves it for the same time in a high traffic Supercharger, which doesn't make sense from a deterrent and usability standpoint.

Edit: [Apparently Elon updated the policy](https://www.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/810135528783937537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) overnight (a good move IMO) so my point is now moot"
"I mean, that's pretty reasonable?

If you don't inconvenience people, what's the harm?"
"The goal is to be efficient/fair as well. 


If you imposed the death penalty on petty theft there would likely be less petty theft, but is that the answer?"
If only there were some sort of method to see which way of doing things works out better. 
If no one is prevented from using a charger there's nothing that needs to be punished in the first place. 
Sounds fine to me if it is accurate 
Ok sure
Wait 'til the model 3's start rolling out.
"I've only been to a few, but the one in San Juan Capistrano, CA had 4 of us waiting for spots at about 12:30 on a Friday afternoon. It's the last supercharger before San Diego, so it gets a lot of use. There was even a valet there to plug people in and keep track of who was next. I've also seen a line at the SpaceX superchargers, so there are definitely some that get more traffic than they can accommodate."
Same. Here in the Midwest I basically never see another Tesla at the Superchargers. I could leave my car parked for a week and never inconvenience someone. 
"Wrong, when people use gas pumps, they don't leave it parked at a pump for hours. They fill up and move (unless they run in to buy something quickly)"
"I disagree, since this just encourages people to make a habit of parking in charging stalls."
Only 1 space remaining is almost as much of a problem as 0 spaces remaining though.
"A supercharge space is not meant for all day parking. You shouldn't be in an active supercharger spot for more than an hour, because that's as long as it takes. Once your car finishes its charge, move your shit or get owned by the $576/day fee."
"Yes, at SuperChargers.  SuperChargers are intended to be used for road trips, not for every day charging.  "
"Nothing, and I'd hope that that's Tesla's end game - you pay $0.40/minute for blocking the stall, but your car is allowed to drive into a parking space by itself when it's done, avoiding the $0.40/minute fee."
Try charging in VA and you'll see.....
"That'll be great in my city, where I see the charging station nearly daily, and at most there are two cars there at any one time. "
"> All in all this is a rather large change so a fairly small problem

It's a problem that affects a fairly small number of superchargers but at those superchargers it's a very large problem."
Lack of other nearby parking?
This is literally the behavior Tesla's policy is encouraging now. Need to nap in the trunk @ 2am at an empty supercharger? Just unplug and finish the last 5% in the morning.
Out of spite?
"That's true, but from what I've seen they aren't the type of company that unfairly screws their customers. They put a lot of effort into making customers feel appreciated, like letting existing Tesla owners get priority for Model 3 reservations, and as a Model 3 reservation holder they printed and mailed me a fancy Thank You card, when they could have spent $0 and just emailed me instead."
"Keep in mind Most people don't Fully charge at a SC, so you don't drop your car off, and take an extra 5 minutes to get coffee and miss your window, if you were able to FULLY charge then it means you left it for a good hour+"
It do the fees go into effect the second you're charged and not out of there?
My guess is that there will be a 5 or 10 min grace when your charge completes. 
If it were a sliding scale people would stay over their allotted time regularly.
"It's not small though, it's way more expensive than parking fees, which is of course the whole point."
[deleted]
Yep! Search Tesla Motors and itll be the one marked Beta.
The Tesla app notifies you when it is almost done charging and when it is done charging.
"SMS message, huh? What they really need is a Blackberry OS app, because as the owner of a $100,000 Tesla Model S, I like to stay on top of all the latest tech trends. "
[deleted]
"Hey its not like it's a complete surprise as to when you'll be done charging, you should have a good idea when its going to need unplugging. "
"There is literally no difference for people with disabilities vs without. You know *exactly* how much longer it's going to take to charge. Adjust your leaving time accordingly. You act like people aren't allowed to leave wherever they are until the car hits 100%, and then it's a race to be there within 5 minutes. It's not. "
Planning ahead is not jumping through hoops. 
"honest question though, how does it know how much time it has left? don't all batteries, even tesla's lose charging ability eventually?"
Parking meters have a penalty for being in the spot past the time. This has a penalty for being plugged in but not for sitting there. 
"Just ask the waiter for the bill before your done eating, and pay attention to how much time you have left on your charge. 

You would plan ahead for a parking meter, why can't you do the same for this?"
What does any of this have to do with your disability that you felt was an important enough factor to mention?
"Right, if you were supposed to wait by the car why would they build the app to tell you how much time you got left and when it's done."
You can walk outside of a restaurant to grab your car and a parking spot.  It's not that complicated.  Be considerate.
">That's actually exactly how long wait times for charging on longer trips were defended: You will stop somewhere to eat anyway. 

Yeah, it's a bit rich. On long trips you now not only need to plan for something to do while charging, but you need to make such it's exactly the right length of time to avoid being charged."
"Honestly, I would just walk outside to move my car and come back to pay. In fact, I would do this without the penalty.  It's extremely inconsiderate to let your car sit for 20 minutes especially since the app tells you when you're full.  Other people may need to charge.

Supercharging entitles you to charging and not parking."
"But is it really that harsh? I mean, it's not like they're going to murder your first born. Or fine you immediately for a few hundred bucks. It's 40 cents per minute, which I grant you could add up, but if you're legitimately stuck somewhere or it's important enough, you just pay the fee and move on with your life. If that 40 cents per minute makes whatever your doing not worth it, then perhaps it is entirely appropriate that you feel pressured to hurry back to your car and move it.

And I don't believe Tesla's description is an endorsement to use Superchargers as destination chargers. I'm reading it as opportunities to fill the time while you wait, which wound be secondary to the primary purpose => charging."
It's not nickel and diming.  It's forcing people to be considerate of others.  It's a shame that people act like fools.
People don't pay 80k for a car that can't be charged because their fellow Tesla owners feel entitled to leave their cars there taking up slots.
[deleted]
Life must be rough owning a $140k car eating hour and a half dinners every evening at fancy restaurants while always needing to supercharge being inconvenienced enough that going outside for a minute and a half is some serious #firstworldproblems.
[deleted]
I would be shocked if anyone that owns a Tesla doesn't have a smart phone. 
"On top of this, the app for Android seems to be broken and a lot of people don't get notifications. I've never seen one on my phone."
"Alternatively, the new ToS will come out with an update due out soon. "
"I think since unlimited supercharger use forever is used for the earlier vehicles, that would actually be the terms. They aren't freely offered charging stations. "
43 days! Just think of someone trying to avoid long term parking at the airport.
"Here in Michigan, that's totally illegal to do.  The pump is to be directly supervised at all times.  If you are pumping your own gas, you are to remain outside the vehicle and in view of the pump nozzle handle while the pump is operating.  I don't know how often anyone is actually ticketed for it, but it actually is a legal matter.  I don't know what the situation is in other states, but I know that this is true in at least a fair number of them."
"Yeah, I'm sure the person in line behind you will be happy to know that ""the gas station did it to themselves"". "
"Yes but not at the exact time it's done. I move it when I come back from whatever approximately 2 hour activity i'm doing, give or take 20 min :) I'm not about to plan my car refueling stops to the minute, that is a major inconvenience."
"Yeah, I was trying to think of a way around this, and was hoping that it would freak them out enough to be courteous and move their car. Maybe not."
well shit...
"I assumed that's why they were doing it. Finding places to park is a big problem here. And it is rarely cheap either. But I'm not from the US, guess it's better over there."
[deleted]
"In general, the plan isn't for people to fill up over two hours, it's to charge for 15-20 minutes at the max rate, drive the the next supercharger, repeat. That's why the Superchargers are 100 miles apart, not 250. 

That plan lets them get the most people through superchargers and gives you the shortest charging time. Everybody wins. If the car takes 2 hours to charge, you already have an extra hour and half to enjoy the parking space while you eat a meal compared to what your journey demands. "
"Or just incorporate a slight break from your meal-similar to a trip to the restroom-to move your car. After all, if you'd like to be able to charge your car when you arrived at a charge point, you'd do the same for others. A slight inconvenience for sure, but much much much less a one than having to sit in your car for an indeterminate amount of time, along with other waiting cars, for a space to open. "
"Oh please. It's hardly absurd. Take two fucking seconds and move your vehicle. Who gives a shit if you're eating, it's to be courteous to other people. "
">you shouldn't have to set it to 100% to get extra time

I agree with that statement."
"Yes, you should have to set it to 100% to get extra time. The whole point of this is spots are for charging, not parking. You admitted that eliminates the problem. Plenty of time for a bathroom break. If not, then you had plenty of charge. What's the issue? "
You must be fun at parties. 
Look at that! Only took a day.
so what would your solution have been? 
"They will bill by electricity used as far as I understand, once they start billing.  Time is only time not charging."
"Has the pricing model been confirmed? I wouldn't be surprised if it's per minute, like this, and maybe even the same price."
and it really is a SMALL credit by the looks of it.
"I probably will not encounter this issue personally either, but the concept is what bothers me. I would much prefer if it was based on current demand and if other drivers are truly waiting then charge even $5 per minute after 15 min so you have time to make it back to your car. If nobody is waiting for your spot then let people finish up whatever they were doing waiting for the charge."
You should be able to set when it warns you. That would help.
"The difference there I guess is that the 'risk' is minimal. 99% of the time I won't get a ticket for staying an extra 20-30 min. With tesla, it's guaranteed and automatic. If it was based on another car pulling up and 'reporting' a full tesla hogging, that would be a different concept."
"I'm willing to bet money tesla changes it or extends the grace period. I'm willing to give tesla money too, but for a company that is all about fair pricing and not nickel and dime-ing customers this is out of character. I don't care if the fee was $1000 an hour, it just needs to not start at the minute and charge per minute, it's petty."
"Charge what you need. Need what you charge. Then move your car.

(edit: /u/Zorb750 I read your other posts in this thread. I know you're not part of the problem. But the circumstances you describe won't be true much longer; soon nearly every SC will be fully utilized. Better to have a simple rule that works today and tomorrow. The old guard like you should dictate what the culture will be. Don't muse about ways to hack around the spirit of the current system. Instead, try to make it work, so the n00bs will follow your example.)"
"Wouldn't it be nice if everyone thought like that? Well, they don't. People will abuse at any opportunity they are given, as evidenced by the fact that this had to be made a policy in the first place."
interesting
ahhhh thank you for your insight. so it wont be as sudden as other people were making it sound got it.
"You can see on your mobile phone how long charging will take, and after some weeks of driving the car, you also will KNOW how long it usually takes to charge. How about not going to see a movie or eat at a luxurious restaurant when you know that it will only take 30-45 minutes to charge your Tesla?
"
"Aww that's a shame.  Disney World worked out all the kinks and did the hard part.  It would be nice to be able to have one band that would give you entrance and hotel key and charging on both coasts, or even worldwide.  "
But then it defeats the primary objective. Funding the network this way is not the stated goal 
"I don't know, what's the longest distance between two superchargers?

edit: Go to https://supercharge.info/ and search for ""Rivière du Loup, QC"" this is about 208 mi away from the next closest Super Charger, so if you have a 60kWh battery, then you MUST use the supercharger at the previous stop to 100% to be able to make it.

You arrive at night, you are tired, you got to be on your way first thing in the morning to make it.

It takes about 2 hours to full charge S 60 - http://i.imgur.com/J1GoBSn.gif

not really practical to sit around for 2 hours waiting.

Lets say that you pay the fee- 15 minutes getting checked in and going to bed, sleep 8 hours, 15 minutes get up and check out = total 8.5 hours parked, 2 hours it took to charge - that's 6.5 hours idle time = 6.5x60=390 minutes x $0.40 = $156

Maybe there are slower charging options on the route without needing a super charge???"
"It's a really old problem.

Charge a rich person a $200 traffic fee and they just shrug it off. Charge the same amount to someone in poverty and they'll have to decide whether they should pay their bills, spend days in jail or try to live as a wanted criminal.

It's probably not as big of a discrepancy when it comes to people who can afford Teslas, though. "
I know of a couple superchargers located at hotels. I would suck to pull in and plug the car in and then go to sleep for the night(phone in do not disturb mode) and wake up to a $200 bill.
Do we know this?
Good thing the driver can control the outcome either way.
Exactly. It encourages people to predict when they can avoid inconveniencing others. 
25 bucks an hour isn't the death penalty. And I'm sure they'll waive the first one if you call in about it.
I don't think they will offer free supercharging with the Model 3
The one in SD was crazy during Comic Con.
I think in general Californian would just have more Tesla's than the east coast  
[deleted]
Very very bad comparison.  People often stay parked at the gas pump for 2-3 times the amount of time it took to refuel. We don't want that with the teslas. 
"Actually I have seen people getting gas and then take forever (15-20 min) to pay / buy snacks / bathroom breaks, etc. Mostly at Highway rest stops. "
"Then people will play the ""will this lot fill up or can I park for free"" game. Sometimes they will lose, and of course it won't be their fault. Cue the complaining."
How does it encourage that? Are you talking about parking without plugging in or  leaving it plugged in after charging is complete? Literally nothing Tesla can do to stop the first problem (even with it's own cars currently) short of towing folks.
Are superchargers normally in locations where there is no other parking?
"At least if you are napping in the car someone can wake you up with an air horn if the supercharger becomes full, so it is not that bad. "
"I agree it would be unlike them not to mention a possible PR shit storm, but for now that reputation is the closest thing to a guarantee we have."
Self driving teslas could just drive out of the space when theyre done
"As others have said, probably not. I was just giving context."
5 minutes after
There's a 5min grace.
I like this guy 
Is it possible to configure a smart phone alert/watch the charging status on your phone?
I laughed. I can feel myself becoming a redditor :(
Is it any good? I hate when the Android version of an app gets no love compared to Apple version.
A guy I work with refuses to give up his blackberry. One of our top engineers too.
"Yeah, everyone has the phone app and can easily see when they have to be on their way. If you need longer then you just have to go to your car when it's at 95% instead of when it's at 99% or whatever makes sense depending how far away you are."
"I was about to suggest this. People are simply going to do this instead of charging to 90%. People are simply going to flip from 90 (or whatever)% to 100% in the five minute grace period and finish their dinner in peace.

I hate to say it, but I think this is going to backfire."
"> How hard is it to set the slider to 100% That will allow nearly two hours from a dead battery and nearly an hour from a 90% battery.

This... doesn't actually solve anything. It makes the problem worse"
"I don't know, it's less about the logistics and more about fairness."
"The real issue is places like Harris Ranch or Barstow where there's a restaurant. Folks are going to flip to 100% or simply walk out, unplug, and go back in."
"They probably can get data like milage on the battery and how old the battery is, and have a formula to work that out."
"It's not like it charges in minutes. It knows the initial charge, and what it should be after a couple of minutes of charging. Any difference can change the estimated time, along with the way the battery is charged. Power trackers have done this for years."
"I was thinking the same thing. Then it donned on me, people with handicap placards (at lease in some areas in  CA) don't have to pay parking meters.  
So they don't know what its like to have to move your car or feed the meter after a given amount of time ;)"
"Been scrolling this thread for a while and seen some of the laziest excuses from people why they wouldn't be able to get their in time lmfao. Barring a crazy medical emergency or something, there's no reason people shouldnt be able to work with this."
"Just to be clear, I view this as a minor annoyance at best. The restaurant example was basically the only time where I think I would personally be stuck paying the charge, and that would be only a few bucks max a year. 

Actually, in the very few instances where I have needed to pay for a parking meter, I would generally simply overpay ahead of time to make sure I didn't need to worry. "
"Assuming the restaurant is that close. 

[Here for example the restaurants are a 10min walk away](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/47.8104987,12.3704814/47.814441,12.367768/@47.8116985,12.3704902,667m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!4m1!3e2). So you would spend 20min just to move your car, if you prefer something better than Burger King."
"If superchargers are backing up to the point where people are literally waiting down to the minute someone leaves to get a spot, then there are just not enough stalls. This should be addressed by adding more. What if you get there and all 10 stalls came just before you? Now you have to wait 2 hours for them to charge + 2 hours for you to charge. Weather someone makes it back in 2 hours or 2.5 is not the problem at that point, the capacity is. The fee should have been structured to address people parking overnight, not people being 20 minutes late."
"I agree but in reality 2 hour is a long time and superchargers are purposely located in areas which have something for you to do in that time, food, shopping etc... It's not about the money it's about the piece of mind. If i get sidetracked or for whatever reason don't make it back by the minute, I have to pay. What if you take a nap in the car and wake up an hour later in an empty super charger lot. That was a $24 nap for absolutely no reason, you inconvenienced absolutely no one. The blanket policy is the problem. Should be more intelligent and demand based."
"Oh I agree with them doing it, no problem there. I just disagree with such a strict grace period and it not being demand based."
"Again, if it comes down to people having to wait to the minute a someone is done charging to leave to get a spot then that supercharger station has a capacity problem and needs to expand. Tesla does not need to cut capacity that close to where people need to leave the minute their cars are charged."
"I'm not joking and I'm closer to a peasant myself if you are implying i'm some kind of entitled upscale asshole. Would you say 'maybe you can have one of your peasants drive you' if i said i would like a self driving car? How is eating your dinner without having to move your car hard to understand? I don't have to move my car now, why would I spend 80k on a car I have to worry about moving at a very specific time?"
"It could be a 35k car at Chilis, the point is that my car should not be something I need to babysit so I don't get charged absurd fees because one company in LA decided to park theirs overnight."
"Mainly that the fine is guaranteed. I can have my parking meter run out and 99% of the time, nothing happens."
"I let my girlfriend drive my car sometimes. She doesn't have the app, nor would I give her access if she wanted the app. "
"Yeah, if you own an $80,000 technological marvel of a car, you could squeeze in a budget $100 android smartphone haha :)"
The more tech you get involved (especially 3rd party) the more technical issues can reek havoc
When the software on the car is updated do you have to accept new ToS? Can you decline said ToS and what happens if you do?
"I honestly don't know state by state where it's illegal to do, but as someone who grew up in Ohio I have never seen a friend or family member walk away from an active gas pump.  It also sure isn't the norm anywhere in the US I've traveled to see other people at a gas station walk away from their vehicle while fueling.  "
"In the UK, you even have to hold the pump. There's no auto pump system, if you release the trigger, the fuel stops. Which seems eminently sensible."
Maybe what you're supposed to do but many people don't. If the place was super busy maybe I would wait till it was charged and moved to go inside and buy something but normally would do it at the same time.
Even in states where it's not illegal it is really dumb. If the cutoff malfunctions and you're not watching you just created a dangerous gas spill.
"I guess you could always move it 10-20 minutes before it finished. That would certainly be a large enough margin, when the primary point for being in that spot was to charge. "
"If you've just driven for 3 hours then you probably have at least 90 minutes of Supercharging time before you hit 100%. If it takes you more than 95 minutes to walk to the restroom, use it, and walk back, then that probably isn't the best activity to pass the time."
"Maybe use the restroom by driving there, then supercharge?"
">   it's to charge for 15-20 minutes at the max rate, drive the the next supercharger, repeat. That's why the Superchargers are 100 miles apart, not 250. 

That's just not true everywhere and might also not work out like that depending on the weather conditions. Watching Björn Nyland's videos it's obvious that you often have to charge longer. "
"Wouldn't a better solution be to only charge the overage at peak times when people request a charger at busy chargers and not have a blanket fee so i gotta move a car with 10 empty spots next to it. I agree with the concept of not hogging the charger and punishing those who do, i disagree with the specific execution of it."
"Again, it's not being courteous to other people if the lot is not full. At that point it's only inconveniencing me. If someone is actually waiting, i would unplug my car at 80% to let them charge, this isn't an issue of respecting others, it's an issue of it not being precise enough to inconvenience 90% of drivers 'just in case' someone needs to charge who may or may not exist."
I disagree. Tesla seems to make arrangements with businesses to place their chargers. Those shops hope for more customers. But they aren't really drive-throughs. I cant see them happy about customers running out of their store to reposition their car... thus you can't say those spots are only for charging.

"Charging per minute would be a strange move. You pay for the amount of water you use, not for the amount of time you have the tap open."
"Well you can always check the app to see how full you are... I'm not sure if anything beyond 15 minutes is really necessary, considering average charge time isn't much longer than that (20-30 mins)"
"It's hard to see how you're taking into account the needs of others or accepting your own role in your situation. Instead you seem to be focused mostly on how the actions of others hurt you. Waitress's fault, colon's fault, etc. Overstaying in a normal parking space is a problem only if you get caught, etc.

The only time you mention lines is when _you're_ stuck in one waiting for the bathroom. No discussion of the people who are queued up at the Supercharger waiting for _you_ to finish wiping. Aren't they at least as victimized as you are in your examples? And perhaps they had a little less agency in the situation than you did."
"There's a difference between abuse and lying. Maybe less than there used to be, but there still is.

Damnit, I'm getting old."
"Of course, that's not at all what I said either. "
"Totally agree. I'm actually pretty excited for the Magic Band 2.0 that can be more of a keyfob than an item you wear on your wrist. Would be great if that was my Universal Disney key. On the same token, I bring my phone with me everywhere and if they could just tie to the NFC that would be pretty awesome too. But we are a bit off topic now ;)"
"Tesla never defined a goal. They simply said they hope to not make money on it. But if they do make money on it, that's good for the rest of us. "
"Don't know.  There are a few stretches of expressway where the trip isn't possible with superchargers alone, but they are disappearing.  Most of the stupid are within 150 miles or so of the next.  This means 20-30 minutes unless the machine is charging uncharacteristically slowly."

"I've stayed at such a hotel many times. I just plug in upon arrival, unload, go to my room, and a little while later I go downstairs and move my car."
On-screen notification whenever you park in a Supercharger slot?
"That's funny, I would suck to *not* get billed. "
"I actually had this happen the night of the 15th. I was the only car on the charger and it was like 3:00 AM when I checked into the hotel. I plugged in and collapsed at the hotel. I tried to initiate a 100% charge via the app at about 7:30 (Long trip to my next SC) but had to go out uplug and replug to get the charge started. I really hope they don't charge me for the 16th as it was announced in the PM. I will definitely not do this in the future, but I figured this one time... Hope it doesn't bite me in the backside."
"Yeah, some kind of exception should be made for chargers that are meant for overnight use."
"We knew this from the blog post, which said that it would be a flat rate, but after it was published [Elon updated the policy](https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/810135528783937537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) so that people who park in empty Superchargers won't get dinged."
"the point is that it'd be stupid. not that 25=death penalty. The end goal is for customers to be happy, not to have empty charging stations. If there's no one waiting why would Tesla give a single shit that they're in the charging spot?"
There is no free supercharging beginning of 2017 buyers
"Oh god, I can't even imagine that. Was there anything done to try to manage all of the demand?"
"You aren't paying attention to the gas pump *because* it's five minutes. You're paying attention because you need to move out of the way. The same applies regardless of how long it takes, even if it's 60. Just because something takes an hour doesn't absolve you of responsibility to properly manage your time in-between. 

Set a timer. Check your watch. Hell look at the sun. 

Most people go to 30-60 minute lunch breaks and come back on time no problem. The same applies here."
"if you own a Tesla you likely own a Smartphone, set a timer."
why can't the car just drive itself away when it's done charging?
"I have a 40 gallon tank, full fill ups take about 10 minutes. "
Highway stops that have about 20-25 gas pumps and attendants to keep things moving.
If it's blocking a spot without even charging why would they not tow it?
"I don't mean lack of spots, I mean lack of *empty* spots. "
It mentions it in the press release as well. This is just a stop-gap until that future arrives. 
"True story, this won't even be a problem for new ones."
"I don't know anything about self-driving Tesla vehicles but, if someone were to leave their vehicle charging and the car moved on its own after being fully charged, does the car let the owner know where it might have parked at?"

Tesla APP
[deleted]
"The Android version is good.  Ironically, the unofficial fan-made Windows phone app gave more car information than the official phone app I use with Android.  "
I don't own a Tesla yet so I can't say :/ hopefully someone else here can chime in though!
"It literally can't backfire. There is no possible scenario in which people are now sitting on the chargers *more* than before. Flipping from 90 to 100 ""so you can finish your dinner in peace"" is no different than them just letting it idle there in the old scenario until they were done. And in cases where it hits 100 and they are *not* done, well now they'll need to go fetch, whereas before they wouldn't. "
"Even in that scenario, the people at dinner won't take any longer to get back to their car than without a fee. So worse case scenario is no change, just more teslas topping off."
what is the issue?
"> So you would spend 20min just to move your car, if you prefer something better than Burger King.

You know what? Too bad for you. I don't see that as license to just leave your car and go there anyway. That means those restaurants are too far away and shouldn't be considered an option (unless of course you decide you're willing to come back to move your car when it's done). Unfortunate? Sure. But it's inconsiderate to do it anyway, at someone else's expense."
#**Maybe you shouldn't eat at restaurants that are that far away if you know you won't be able to return to your car in time and are not willing to pay a frankly paltry fine if you are late.**
"Life isn't always perfect. In that case, I would not get a sit down meal.  Just one mans opinion though."
"This doesn't make sense. If you're going to spend 10 minutes to walk to a restaurant and 10 minutes back to your car then just walk those 10 minutes back to your car when it finishes charging and spend 1 minute driving that car back to the restaurant and park and finish your meal at your leisure.

10 minutes is a long bathroom break but isn't crazy, and I'm sure your companion(s) would welcome not having to walk back to the car or, if you're dining alone, the restaurant would understand your brief absence."
[deleted]
"I respect your view on this but I disagree. The number of Teslas on the road will triple in the next two years and if the social norm is 'charge and come back some time later to fetch your car' then we're going to have a real problem in a lot more places than we do now.

That said, there is a very real problem right now in many places. Don't dismiss that just because you don't live near one of them."
[deleted]
Looks like an ev early adoption is not for you then.
"$4 for 10 minutes is hardly absurd.

If you have a better solution for ensuring availability of supercharging slots, please, elaborate. "

"Well i mean, with the model 3 starting at 35k next year there could very well be people without smartphones driving it around in a couple years from now"
"I haven't had to agree to a new TOS yet. 

The only lawyer language was for the autopilot beta where they tell you that the software is not perfect and you should be ready to take control at all times."
"Same in Canada as far as I know, I had no idea just leaving it pumping was a thing in some places."
"No, at a gas station you are required to.  At an electric vehicle charger, you are not.

The logic is that the auto shutoff in a gas pump depends on a pressure switch, which is not infallible.  I myself have had this happen to me when I was washing the windows on my car.  I was on the other side of the car, the pump didn't stop at full, and I ended up with a couple of gallons of gas spilled down the side of the car.

The requirement to observe the pump is most often attributed to fire protection, though spilled fuel has a very high water contamination potential.  Just small amounts of motor vehicle fuels can contaminate large amounts of lake or river water if washed into storm drains or ground water if soil is sandy."
"Sure, if you move your charge target to 90% or something all my points become invalid :)"
[deleted]
"For sure, when it's cold and hilly and there's a headwind, you're going to need quite a bit longer to charge. But charges to the maximum should still be rare, and since charging slows down so much near the maximum, you should have plenty of time to get to your car. 

Looking at the 2017 map that just came out, a large portion of chargers are in places that are supercharger dense (eg California, the DC-NYC-Boston corridor, Florida, Dallas and Houston, the Front Range corridor. etc). The next supercharger in these locations is typically nowhere near 100 miles away. 

Where wind and cold and mountains might require a full charge to make it 100 miles, like Western Montana, they tend to shoot for more like 70-80 mile spacing, plus you're probably the only one there and don't have to worry about fees at all. 

I guess what I'm saying is that it's in both Tesla's interest and their customers' interest to have the vast majority of charging be from ~10% to <70%. You save time, they save on the number of stalls needed to serve their customers. If they set up the rules to be friendly to 100% charging, that would encourage them to set up the network for 100% charging, too. It's much better for everybody if they set up the network for 50% charging and we use it that way. 

"
"I think it develops the social norm that the spot is seen only as a charging spot, not a parking one, so there's no need for a difference in opinion on which Tesla customer had the greater need. After all, if you were the only one in an 8-bay, how would you know to move it an hour later, in the middle of (the movie, shopping, conversation, etc)? It's on the completed charger to move (or pay for the convenience of not moving), and never on the uncharged because, ""hey, it was only 10 minutes"" or ""how was I to know it got crowded?"" Everyone who has completed charging has the same expectation to move, rather than a 'greater need to park' being the rationale between the 8 currently parked. 

The 'greater need is always the uncharged' is a norm that will always serve everyone, while the squatter's rights can only be partial. Inculcating this now will equalize the adoption of the norm *before* the swarm of new owners arrive. It resolves a major factor in range anxiety that will otherwise develop. "
"Well maybe with enough feedback, they will input a system like that. However, as other users mentioned, when you start going into semantics like that, it can get complicated real quick."
You can change the charge limit with the app.
What the hell? Just fix the problems???
"Not strange at all when you're sharing a limited number of faucets with other people. Every minute you spend charging is a minute no one else can charge, and if Tesla can reduce the average amount of time people spend charging that means that they don't need to build as many Superchargers.

It's not like this is an academic distinction either - once you cross 80% full Supercharging significantly slows down as it approaches 100%. You're using less kWh as your battery gets slowly topped off, but you're still taking up valuable space, so why not pay accordingly?"
"I see how what i'm saying appears to be a one-sided issue. I'm not putting myself in the shoes of a Tesla that pulls up and all stalls are full with charged cars. My argument is that scenario is highly unlikely in most locations, and the other scenarios are more likely. And in those areas where the superchargers are full most of the time, the issue isn't people coming back to the car 20 minutes later, it's that there just are not enough chargers."
"From the Tesla  blog post ""... idle fee  aims to increase Supercharger availability."" How is that not the goal? Also, as you're already warming up to the idea that it's OK just reinforces my point."

"Curently, as we are moving more and more towards electric cars there will be  more middle class or lower middle class people, to them 200 is not life breaking but still hurts."
"> Non existent in this situation because there are no ""people in poverty"" that own a Tesla

could be ... I would LOVE a Tesla, but when a P90D is right around the same price as a 3BR townhouse in Houston, yea, I have to think about priorities of purchases. 

The model 3 will be where I enter the electric car market (FINALLLYYYY! I was looking to convert to electric DIY back in 2007, but was well, poor, now I'm ok, in three years I should be doing ok) right as I can afford one, it will be either a used S or a new Model 3"
"Yep, me too. Unload, take a shower, and unplug. Easy."
"It doesn't say when the fee goes into effect. Since you didn't get any notifications I think you are in the clear. I think that Tesla needs to do some app/software updates to roll this out so it probably won't be in effect until the new year, but Tesla is being intentionally vague about the timing so that people stop hogging chargers right away.

This is mostly to punish Tesloop for treating LA superchargers as their own private parking spots."
"Superchargers aren't meant for overnight use, period."
None of them are meant for overnight use...
There aren't any of those.
"shit, better put in a buy order next week.  thanks homie"
"The cars were queuing up pretty orderly. Other than that, what else can you do, right? I am reasonably certain that several of the cars had been finished charging for a while. I am in full support of what Tesla wants to do here. There are just too many people out there that will be inconsiderate unless they are compelled to behave otherwise."
The tesla app notifies you when the ca is done charging.
I would think the Tesla app would notify you at a user defined charge percentage or charge time remaining.
"And walk out on your bill at a restaurant or whatever? If there's functional spaces open, 0 fee. If not, charge. "
"This. All these fancy ideas on how to charge people when the real solution is right there in front of everybody's eyes:

Have the car disconnect, move away from the charger and park in the vicinity.

This solution requires of course that the supercharger does not need a human to disconnect without breaking, and that there are parking options nearby."
That's the goal eventually. They even mention it in the official announcement. But this is meant to be a partial solution while the autonomous driving is not available yet 
Genius
"Because the answer to ""where would it go"" is far from trivial.  

What happens if there's no nearby parking?"
"Whoa, you must have super slow gas station pumps in US. Haven't seen anything slower than 0.5l/s in Europe, which would fill 40 gallons in 5 minutes."
Aren't they unmanned?

I think elon said you can.track it on your phone
"The new feature allows the car to come to you, you may not even notified if it parked itself somewhere. The only issue with parking itself is disconnecting from the power supply."

"I would pretty much guarantee that this will back fire, for the same reason that businesses that provide open ended paid sick leave tend to see lower usage than those that provide a defined amount.

Before, there was social pressure to move your car as soon as you had sufficient charge for your purposes.

Now this policy basically destroys that social pressure. There are now formal rules that let you charge for free for basically 2 hours. 

People that would have run out of the restaurant to move their car after 30 minutes because that was the expectation of the ""unwritten"" code will now stay for the full two hours because it's what the rules allow."
"And unplugging it when it's sitting there overnight is no different than camping in the spot. :)

Having read Freakonomics, I think there may be creative people out there. Dunno. Time will tell. "
"I think they might be getting at how people can now set their charge level to 100% to gain an extra hour-ish. 

Someone who might have left 15-30 minutes after full charge before won't move for two hours total instead, and it might mean that more stalls stay occupied for longer at the same time.

(These are not my thoughts, just what I think the comment or may be saying.)"
"Have you seen German Superchargers? It's incredible rare that all spots are taken. Of course Tesla can do this and people can say it's inconsiderate, but customers will consider stuff  like this when they buy their next car."
"Yeah, but then Tesla also doesn't have to expect people to continue to buy this car who want something better than Burger King when they are advertising eating while the car charges."
"I guess you could do that if there is easy parking at the restaurant and you won't be looking for a spot, but you still have to leave at most likely a pretty inconvenient time. "
"They do but that's different. Your max wait is 5 min and there is probably another one right across the street, if not there is one 1/4 mile down the road."
"I respect what you are saying as well, and two years from now my points may be invalidated by every supercharger being full all the time. However, for now it's kind of a TSA thing. One idiot put a bomb in his shoe and now we all have to take our shoes off at the airport."
"Haha lol, i see that, but no. My whole reason for buying a tesla is convenience, i no longer have to drive, that's very convenient. I don't have to go to a gas station once a week, convenient. Less maintenance, convenient. Big screen tablet in car, convenient. So having to rush to move car when done charging, not convenient. It's not like I have to go move my car at dinner now and am saying because i paid 80k i should no longer need to do that. I'm saying there are better solutions so that I won't need to move my Tesla either."
"You think this will go away when there are 10x more teslas on the road? It'll be an even bigger problem then. This has nothing to do with early EV adoption, in fact I do 99.99% of my driving in town so even when I get a 3 i'm not sure it'll ever see a supercharger, so personally I won't have a problem at all. I'm arguing the concept because it's poorly executed."
"A guy somewhere in this thread just posted 'have someone request the spot and if there is a request get charged if you don't come in 10 minutes.' Perfect solution, demand based, not by the minute and I would rush to move it no matter what because I know someone is waiting rather than rush to move my car when there are 10 empty spots next to it."
"I do, they roll by once a week. lol"
Its a thing in Winnipeg fo sho
Agree. But there is no debate right now in who charging has the greater need. It's simply a debate in who needs a spot 'right now': the charged or the uncharged. And this boils the decision to one regarding it being a charging-not a parking-spot. 
So drive over to another bathroom before/after charging...
"I agree with you that this measure is about relieving range anxiety, it does that well. How well it keeps bays open remains to be seen. Also, for others it creates some anxiety because you must be back at a specific time. While Tesla would love for you to think that superchargers are a 'gas station' in reality it's a parking spot with a cable, at a mall or a restaurant. If they marketed it as a 'wait by your car for an hour' concept, people wouldn't like it. Instead they say, 'grab a coffee or a bite to eat, we'll let you know when it's done.' To me, that implies causality, and for most superchargers, it's entirely ok because they are empty 99% of the time. Only a few superchargers in the country have a congestion issue. There are better ways to deal with this problem."
"Not sure if you saw, but Elon already changed it. They will no longer charge on empty chargers."
[deleted]
"That's reasonable. If Tesla is successful, then most Superchargers will graduate from the first group to the second group.

You're absolutely right that more stalls will help in the long term. In the short term, a tesla.com blog post and a few lines of code in the 8.1 update might be the stopgap that gets Tesla from here to there.

If it means an unexpected crap costs you $1.20, you can take comfort that you have a charged car to come back to."
I wasn't articulate -- my point is that funding the network by people who overstay their welcome isn't a bad thing
"There are a large number of stations along that route, birth free and paid.  There are a few CHAdeMOn stations in particular.  In order to maximize time, and the value of the $10/hr, I would recommend to charge for one hour at the SC, then 45 minutes or so at CHAdeMO.  If you wanted, there are a couple of Tesla chargers as well, but they are obviously slower."
"Also, currently, the cheapest Tesla you can own is 80k"
I'm thinking the same thing but I'm sure in another 3 years Tesla will have at least 2 more models within the price range to choose from
I dont understand how people with enough money to own luxury vehicles can't find something better to do than come on reddit.
"Oh. Sry, non-owner here."
"Ya, unless Tesla is going to hire hotel-style valets for the superchargers (which is an expense, not a profit), they have to do something, and this is the most reasonable solution."
"Well it gives you the exact time it will done too, so you can't even be surprised. That's why anyone who acts like ""but what if I'm eating, shopping, etc, I can't get there in 5 minutes waaa!"" Are wrong. Nothing being responsible and planning won't solve."
even better!
"set timer for 20 minutes before done, time your eating, be smart. how hard is it to be smart and not make someone else have to wait? yes, takes some effort, but makes it better for everyone."
"I don't see why it can't have an auto disconnect. Ambulances and fire trucks around here all have quick disconnects that the cable just pops out and retracts when you start the engine. 

https://www.heimanfireequipment.com/popup_image.php?pID=642&osCsid=a1c438e903aaeea0a8254b6739b2139d"
"I don't know much about them really, but in my area cars can't just go around parking on properties for as long as they want, there's bylaws and shit. I probably should have commented because I'm ignorant about it in any aspect, but it doesn't seem like a place I would be safe parking like that"
That'll be $0.40 a minute for sitting there while you wait.
Look! It's here!
"5 years from now ""My car drove away and my phone is dead FML"""
"Disconnecting wires is not that difficult,  compared to self driving cars anyway. 

Could be as simple as electromagnets that disengage when car is at desired charge level and pull of the cable does the rest. "
"Companies with open ended sick leave tend to market for better employees than those with fixed amounts. The policy stratifies those who would abuse sick time vs those who wouldn't. Your analogy is shit.

Tesla does not somehow change user behavior because there is now a limit on idle time."
The point is most people aren't creative (or don't care) and just take the easiest path which is changing from leaving your car to moving your car.
"But is there some competing EV manufacturer in Germany that has a comparable network of 100kWh fast chargers that doesn't do this? If not, I'd suspect not many people are going to care all that much. And if so, I'd still be surprised if it actually had a measurable effect on demand.

Either way, you're right that it's less necessary when there aren't people waiting. So perhaps the first pass is a bit crude, and could be refined a bit to account for demand. But it's a start, and the problem needed to be solved."
Just set your charge limit to 100%. Who goes to a supercharger for a charge and a meal when they're still 50% full? Because if you're less than 50% full a 100% charge will give you an hour. If you need an hour and 20 minutes for your meal then $8 for parking shouldn't be a problem. If you need more time than that then you should be able to find some time between dinner and coffee to move your car.

"It works fine when mass adoption occurs, because cities like kansas city have more chargers than ev's to fill them. "
"So your issue isn't the fee as much as its current implementation. 

These things could come as revisions, but you increase the complexity of it, and that increases confusion. 
Under conditional fee schemes, You will have people complaining that their phone went flat, and they didn't get the notification that there would be a few levied. "
Huh. Admittedly haven't made it that far west but interesting to know. Is there no trigger at all?
"The whole point of SCs was to do things while you wait for your car to charge, if you have to do things before even starting to charge then just sit there and babysit the car, supercharging just became a lot more tedious and time consuming."
"Interestingly enough, regarding the Tesloop LA-LV taxi service that hogs spots overnight, I figured at 6 hours of parking (ie, after charging), they'd have to pay $144 every night to maintain their current procedures. That's rather impressive. "
I've never had a problem with it.
"Of course it is if it doesn't result in increased availability.

People where SCs are always full see no change and are still angry.

People where SCs are almost always available now have to micromanage the time else be charged when there is no real demand.

It creates ill will to a large portion of the customer base."
It's $68k for a base 60 though?
[deleted]
"Used Tesla Model S are starting in the $40k range. Not that someone poor should buy it due to future repair problems and insurance rates, but it is not 80k."
I bought mine CPO for less than that.  Not all Tesla owners are upper middle class or upper class.  
That's not true. Not even in Canada. Unless you mean new. 
I just priced one out last week at the dealership and it was 68k? Not that I can afford it anyway. But I was curious
"even better ... I was a little pissed, I had my decent in shape diesel car blow it's trans, it was 6k to fix, but the car is in good shape (less the trans) so I see it as ""buying"" a decent used car for 6k, which gives me about 3 years of use for a reasonable return and save up for the Tesla."
"Honestly, I bet some of the world's strongest and scariest people kick back and browse dank memes like the rest of us."

"Owning a luxury vehicle has nothing to do with enjoying Reddit, and please don't assume that everyone that owns luxury items have plenty of money. Some people buy things they probably shouldn't. When I was younger, I worked at a grocery store and loaded groceries into new Cadillacs after they used food stamps to buy the groceries."
"Me too :P

'Superchargers' are like gas stations, you wouldn't park at a pump overnight!"
"Fees also make it profitable to run independent valet operations for the busiest SCs (just where it's needed) - someone can offer the service of moving your car the short distance from SC to parking space when it's charged for (say) $5 per car, allowing you to disappear off to somewhere for more than 75 minutes (60 minutes to charge, 15 to incur $5 worth of late fees) without worrying."
"AGAIN IF OTHER CHARGES ARE OPEN. 

Does saying it in all caps make it easier for you?"
Tesla actually makes a charger with a mechanized arm that reaches out and finds the charging port on the car. They could totally just use those and have it auto retract. 
I missed it :(

"Your understanding of human behavior is shit. 

As is your understanding of HR policies.

But don't take my word for it; watch and see. 

What just happened is that it is now no longer against the rules (written or understood), or contrary to simple human decency, to leave one's Tesla plugged in all day long as it was a few days ago.

Now it's a simple dollars and cents calculation. It's explicitly permissible to leave your car at a supercharger all day - for a low, low cost of $24 an hour after the first two hours. And I daresay that generally a person who can afford a $100k car won't blink at paying $24 an hour if it means he can finish his fancy dinner, or wrap up her shopping, or get a full night's sleep, or whatever.

TL, DR: Take Psych 101.

"People are actually pretty creative. 

There's a story about a daycare that started fining parents $6 for every half hour they were late picking up their child. Late parents shot up exponentially because it was the cheapest baby sitter in town.

I'm not saying it won't work, I'm just saying sometimes you don't quite get the result you intended. 

It's definitely better than nothing. "
"Sorry your app crashed, would love to have read it :)"
"Yesssss, absolutely. I'm not saying people should be able to hog the chargers or not be punished for doing so. I'm only saying the specific way they want to do it is not the best way to do that IMHO.

Regarding the phone, they could do that now too 'my phone died so i wasn't sure when it was done.'"
"Its pretty much just a metal tab underneath the trigger that you fold over and locks it in the compressed position. Its a godsend in the winter when you forget your gloves and a minor convience anytime else. I havent seen anyone leave their pumps unattended (not only a saftey thing, but because gas thefts) im sure it happens though."
"What do you mean? It's very easy... you still have 30-60 minutes to go do whatever. And if it takes you longer, just pay. This is a great thing for all of us. I'm almost always back in my car before it hits 100%"
I think that was the main target and i think it will definitely work for that scenario. There is no way they can afford $144 a day in parking fees.
I don't think that's true. It will definitely have an impact on SCs that are crowded.

Having 700,000 in ""savings""? Having 20x (BTW, that's /2/10...just use 20 smart guy) the original value of the vehicle? At the point you have that much, you could buy a fleet of 10 model 3 and start a courier business.

Lots of people looking at the Model 3 are probably making foolish financial decisions. I've seen people in here talking about putting almost no money down on a loan, or asking how to get the cheapest payment possible by having the longest terms possible, and even asking what the break-even point is for a lease with extra miles versus a loan because a lease is cheaper. But the advice you've given here is the other extreme of foolish.

If someone is dumb enough to over spend on a car they don't need, I'd at least rather it be a full EV than a BMW 3 series or a Mercedes C300. "

"nah, it's super simple. Tesla owners can't be bothered to set a timer to pop out and move their car while at a meal, just like everyone else does when they need to feed the meter or something. so then other Tesla owners can't charge which is annoying so then some need a fee but some are so rich a fee of pennies an hour is no big deal and all of instead of just play nice so then daddy Elon steps in with the fee and now the Tesla owners are super upset, like is that fair? what if I'm at location with nobody else there? wah, exceptions, edge cases, rush out and not pay my meal, inconvenient!"
Then why did you say 80k?
[deleted]
"I'm not trying to contribute anything.

Also, since Elon owns more than 20% of Tesla outstanding shares, if there are 5 or more M3s made so far, I consider him owning 100% share to 1 of them."
"So in your assessment, a $416 average car payment is the dumbest thing you can do with money unless you're sitting on three-quarters of a million?

In my personal case, after retirement savings, bills, personal expenses, and vehicle loan payments (which I pay 50% extra on toward the principal), I save more than 4x that average car payment. For personal savings. That means for every, say, two months I save I can pay more than a month's worth of all bills (not just essentials). I consider myself firmly in the ""middle class"" bracket, maybe even ""upper middle"".

Certainly I'm not arguing that lots of people do dumbshit with their money. I am arguing that sitting on $700k just to buy a $35k car is also dumbshit reasoning. Also, consider the fact that some people take deep personal pleasure from vehicles. I'd say $35k is probably more than you should spend on just having fun, but whatever."
Because don't you have to pay taxes on it? 
"There was no option to pay more than $1000.  Also even at 35k (averaging higher than that as that's with zero options) you're still talking middle-upper middle class income, definitely not poverty line."

So include tax rebates then
You asked if he knew anyone who owned a Tesla. It's a stupid question if you already knew your answer. You got a stupid response. Let's leave it at that. 
"Well, since you said _savings_ and not _investments_, which you could lose unlike savings, you're sitting on it."
[deleted]
"...except traditional savings and some money market accounts are FDIC insured. Like, the more you say the less I think you understand.

But let's play your silly little game. If you spread your $700k into seven $100k accounts so each could be federally insured against loss if the bank goes bust, and those accounts all accrue 1% interest (which is a somewhat decent rate on average for a traditional savings account), you're only making $7000 in interest each year. This is so little money that it's pointless.

On the other hand, you could put this money to actual work for you and increase your return considerably. Like adults do when they have $700,000 in liquid cash.

The fact that you gave the 'ol reliable ""stuffed in a mattress"" bullshit answer pretty much ends this conversation here. You clearly think you've got some sage advice, which frankly _very_ few people on Reddit could ever follow to begin with. I highly suspect you yourself couldn't follow it, or you'd have actually said something more intelligent than ""savings"" to do with the money. All of the actually wealthy people I've ever known have had the majority of their money tied up in businesses and investments, which they could convert to liquid cash in a matter of weeks if needed. Then they have a _much_ smaller amount of cash in higher yield accounts (money markets, etc) in the event they needed cash very quickly (3 days or less). And it's certainly not $700k sitting in those accounts, because they are actually in the business of turning their money into more money."

"The car ahead hadn't even braked yet! Definitely looks like a case of the radar bouncing underneath the first car. That's incredible!!!! 

Edit: Someone below suggested that it may have detected the stopped car once the leading vehicle starts to move right, and the timing does match that (even though the lead vehicle still hadn't braked). In the interest of safety, I think we should wait for Tesla's analysis before assuming the 'bounce' effect would work in a similar situation. "

"So if you were driving along not in AP and had your foot on the go pedal, would the car still AEB, or would you being on the gas override the emergency braking? "
"Now that was impressive. 
"
Tesla reacted to the car rapidly decelerating 2 cars ahead not the one directly in front of it. Impressive. 
"Such amazing technology. Such a contrast with the person filming a screen. :O

Seems the people in the car wanted to jump out immediately to help. But the driver told them not to. 

If you want to die on the highway, getting out at the wrong time would surely do it. 

I always wonder if more accidents happen on perfectly straight highways, as that makes it impossible to see what happens ahead. 


Edit: I must say I genuinely **hate** people who think they are smart and change lanes if people brake in front of them. The driver in the opel corsa was completely occupied with changing lanes. Didn't hit the brakes at all :O

Edit2: I count a whopping 3 full seconds from the time the car (in front of the corsa) slammed on the break, and until impact. That's an eternity of not paying attention to whats happening in front of you. "
"I love that this is in the Netherlands (I think) and the woman's immediate response to the accident is ""Holy Cow!"""
I just hate how people can still hate on this and on Autopilot/cruise control/computer controlled driving. It's mind blowing.

"Why is nobody pointing out that the title makes no sense?

"Damn, that's smooth as fuck."
I wouldn't have been able to call this one in my own car... amazing.
That was a bad one! 
That's why you leave a good 2-3 second gap between you and the car ahead. I'll never understand why people don't do this...
"I'm so glad a different post of this made it to the front page. I love that so many people are getting more knowledge of this. Lots of people in that post that had no idea about the radars in Tesla too, lots of people learning about Tesla :)"
"It can see two seconds into the future, lets accept that. All those excuses about radars are just to cover the real thing."
That was brutal
"something about grammar, and im no teacher, made me think the tesla got into the accident itself.

red car was all too human."
"Unrelated to the car itself, but good on the Model S driver for remaining in the same spot after coming to a halt, rather than moving out of the lane. You want as much mass as possible between the vehicles that may still be moving and the vehicles which have weakened structures and (potentially) injured occupants."
How did Tesla seemingly make the sound before the accident even happened? I want to believe but I'm not sure what's going on here.
This is part of the reason why car-to-car communication is so important. Imagine every driver within a mile being notified and prepared.
Is that deceleration sound that comes the instant the alert ends the (regen?) breaks kicking in?

There was no traffic in front of the idiot that just stopped in the fast lane.
Can someone explain how it was able to measure the speed/breaking of a car two cars ahead?
GD ass hole not paying attention going down a bloody highway.. people piss me off lol. thank god the Tesla stopped this guy and thankful even more the person behind the Tesla was paying attention.. 
Bit of a sidetrack up there on thread 1....
"Serious question... is the autopilot brakes for you to prevent a front end collision, what's to stop the car behind the tells from re-ending it? My Mazda 6 has MMRC that brakes for cars closing down in front but that doesn't prevent me from getting re-ended. "
"I don't own a Tesla. Is there a big, obvious, instantaneously available button or something to disable automatic braking if it should occur in the wrong situation? Or is it hardwired in? Or do I need to open up a menu on a computer or something?"
*but how did it know...*
You know it's impressive when I have nothing to say but - *that's impressive*
Did Musk see this? Curious. Great real-life test done here. 
Here's a concise one: https://youtu.be/IOZveZfTkAI
Title is incorrect. 
"How is this reported in different countries?

Here in Finland it has been reported roughly as ""Tesla AP has predicted (as in, saw in to the future) a crash and then manages to avoid it"" which really rubs me the wrong way.

The AP didn't see the future, it saw the present situation infront of the car infront of the Tesla, one is spatial and other is temporal. But  at least it is reported in a positive manner, so not all bad."
"Imagine how effective cars will be at preventing collisions when other cars are actively alerting them. It's fantastic that Tesla can detect distant brake lights and determine that a collision is eminent, but in the future both cars (and maybe even some sensors on the road/guard rail) will be sending messages directly to the surrounding cars to alert them of the brake (in addition to the Tesla watching out for the lights). And ideally a human wouldn't have been driving, so there would be almost no delay in reacting to said message.

I think a lot about what is most likely to kill me (and when), and currently I have trauma due to a traffic collision high on the list (and potentially very soon). It really excites me to know that that probability is almost surely about to plummet in the very near future."
"If a Tesla were to slam the brakes in a situation like this and could ""sense"" that a vehicle behind it was not going to stop in time, would it be able to gun the gas and turn right to get out of the way? Or is braking tech the focus right now? I wonder how much work has gone into situational awareness...."
That doesn't sound like a Tesla warning beep
"A lot of new cars do this, and not just high end luxury cars, I think the Nissan Rogue had this feature. "
damn that was crazy
Holy Cow!
[deleted]
"It's not using radar off the ground to view cars further ahead. The brake lights of the truck can clearly be seen though the car's window. If the Tesla were monitoring the truck and car ahead, it would have started beeping much sooner.

Watch it slowly and you'll notice that the Tesla only starts beeping once the car swerves to the right. The beeping happens pretty much right at the same time the driver's side rear of the car ahead begins to be revealed.

The Tesla is just reacting to the newly revealed stationary/slow car. If it were able to ""see"" the cars ahead, it would have been beeping when we can see the brake lights in the window."
I wonder why this post does not have more upvotes. I tried to upvotes but it did not register. Maybe some Tesla haters have downvoted?
Elon's twitt implied that the system predicted the accident itself but I think it rather detect the car ahead rapidly slowing down. You see the red car getting caught off guard trying to escape at the last moment but fails.
The fuck is this stupid tweet when the actual raw footage is available. 
[deleted]
This should be higher up. Much better quality than the recording of playback on a monitor.
Good on this guy for ensuring everybody in his car's safety and then jumping out to help the people in front of him. Too many people would just drive past. 
"Gotta love /r/cars (saw this video was posted there with Alientube). Downvoted below zero because 'other cars have collision avoidance too'. I'd like to see a video of a different car doing the same.

Edit: the tides have turned, it's upvoted now. Don't mind me."
"the perfect amount of ""please pay attention *right now*"""
It's louder than it appears in this video. I've jumped in my seat from this warning.
"As a sound designer, that's the kind of stuff I would love to do at Tesla! Someone has to do it, right?

(I made a post in here recently asking for advice on l related to that)"
Totally.  Obnoxious enough for just the right amount of time.

"The only things I personally believe should remain:

* Non-electronic brakes

* Mechanical steering

Why?

Transistors give approximately a nanosecond of warning before they fail. Mechanical things tend to give far more warning. The number of vehicles which suddenly had a steering arm snap are... Well, I'm making it up, but I imagine it's a number you could count with your fingers."
"Not simply  computer controlled,  but forward radar.   Not simply AI. It bounces on the ground to look ahead of the car in front.  LIDAR CANNOT DO THIS. "
"I think it is going to take a while before we collectively support robot cars because we like to be in control and when that is taken away, even if its beneficial to us, we will scrutinize every little flaw Tesla's cars have or will have. 

When computer controlled cars become more and more common, the news media will focus on every accident the cars get into and the public might say ""see! a human will never have caused that/a human would've been more aware"". Probably not knowing that the accident was caused by human error. 

There's a lot of car accidents that happen everyday, but we don't care/notice because it is so common. If 10 robot cars, out of hundreds of thousands, get into crashes, it'll be enough for the public and the media to raise pitchforks. 

*This is just my opinion and I felt out of my element writing the comment. "
I'm fine with it I just always want to have the option to disable it and have a steering wheel.
That's awesome
"People only are against it when something wrong happens, but they don't realize how much computer controlled things in their lives every day, go to the hospital and every medication is put into a a pump machine that will pump medication in your veins every few seconds.

You don't see people arguing about automated intravenous pump machines.

"
"You know, I really only have one argument against it---- upkeep. Many people do not or cannot maintain their cars properly. I work in airplane maintenance and for autopilot to work planes have to be within certain tolerances. Pretty tight tolerances. I think it's a great idea for a few cars but I feel like EVERY car at every price point having the function may prove troublesome."
A good driver would have (should have) reacted exactly the same way.
head over to /r/videos post of this video. read some of those comments.
Lol any car that costs as much as a Tesla should easily be able to brake in this time period.
Or [this](https://youtu.be/bzD4tIvPHwE?t=7s) one.
"Rolling over dissipates the energy of a crash very cleanly and evenly, also it can be a fun ride for the occupants!"
Every video with a suv getting love tapped by a car ends up with the suv flipping. Its ridiculous
they're certainly not designed to not roll over. 
"Seriously though, how? "
Perfect example of why radar is better than lidar.
"Doesn't look like that to me. It didn't start beeping until the car ahead began to move right. The beeping happens exactly when the stopped car is revealed due to the movement. If it was bouncing off the car in front, it would have started beeping a hell of a lot sooner since you could even see the brake lights of the other cars through the window of the one that caused the collision."
"The car in front of the Tesla (it looks red... red-like) NEVER brakes.  It was signaling, changing lanes to the right and may have been looking to the lane he was about to enter when he hit the suddenly stopped car directly in front.

"It would beep and start to brake, but if you pressed harder on the accelerator it will cancel the brake."
"I read your comment as ""not that impressive"" and was like, damn, what does it take to impress /u/vita10gy......"
"The Corsa driver was paying attention and saw the brake lights, but made the choice, in this situation the wrong one, to switch the lane. He wasnt expecting that the car infront of him would push the brakes that hard to make a full stop. Add to this maybe too little distance to the car infront (cant tell exactly because of the angle). Not defending, just saying what i think happened there."
"This is how I got in a major accident like this. My view of a car stopped in the middle of the freeway trying to get into an exit lane was blocked by the SUV in front of me. They swerved last second leaving me about 50 feet away going 60 MPH. No major injuries, thank goodness.

I still haven't processed your much I was at fault for that, but I am much more conservative around major freeway intersections as a result. You don't control the other drivers and all that."
"> Humans are such bad drivers.

I personally don't think this is entirely the case. Thing is AP can see things better than you. If you could  hook up directly to the sensors being used and see what they see you could potentially be a better driver. As it stands our sensor organs are inside the car. AP has sensors outside of the car + is able to bounce of radar. If you had eyes outside the car to park, and could bounce off your sight off objects... wouldn't you be a little better at such things?  if you could process it all properly :P. Wait till the Technology augmented humans come around."
"It sounds like it. You can hear the ""bum-bum"" (high-low) sound as it disengages."
It not news if nobody died.
Why wouldn't it?
Done... hmm seems to be removed
"Based on other comments it doesn't seem to be the case. It is not predicting anything, the radar is able to pick 2 cars ahead and detect ~~breaking~~ braking in the front most car

Edit: corrected brain fart"
I don't think AP 1.0 actually tracks and calculates collision events between other vehicles. I think it just tracks 2 cars ahead for an imminent collision event with the Tesla (as if the car immediately ahead of it wasn't there) and reacts accordingly. 
"To me it seemed like the red car was trying to change lanes to avoid slowing down, and misjudged the space he had between the car in front and the car to their right. Living in southern California I see this happen all the time. "
"Also ""traffic jam""?"
"""It"" as in the traffic jam"
"No, it is crashing into the traffic jam."
"It's got nothing to do with Tesla.

I've got two Mercs, both not that new and they both do this. 

If it seems unlikely that the driver will respond they pre-tension the seat belts and start to apply the brakes."
"It's strange to me. The red car's brake lights don't turn on, but it seems to swerve a bit. More like drifting actually. Perhaps distracted driving. "
"If the Model S had moved, it would give an approaching car an additional 20-30 feet of room to decelerate before a collision...."
Model S driver is risking being crashed into himself.
The front facing radar is able to bounce under the car in front of you and gather data on what's going on. It was able to detect what was happening 
"It didn't detect the accident, it detected the rapid slowdown ahead."
The radar saw the car two cars forward start to slow down.
"> How did Tesla seemingly make the sound before the accident even happened?

It made the warning sound 3 seconds AFTER the brake lights of the SUV two vehicles in front of the Tesla came on."
"No, you can see the car that the SUV got shoved into go off to the right shoulder."

So the accident wouldn't have happened if the Tesla hadn't started braking?
"In one release, Tesla said it was bouncing radar off the road beneath the car in front of you, to see cars in front of it. But I don't know if that's what's being used in this instance. Another commenter mentioned being able to see the front car's break lights through the other car's windows. If so, then an alert driver could have made this ""prediction"" too, no superhuman vision required. "
"Folks, we may well be the last generation of humans that are allowed to drive...."
"The Tesla performed a controlled slowdown because it detected the SUV rapidly decelerating.  The early detection gave the Tesla plenty of time to slow itself down.  If the Tesla slammed on its brakes, yes, there would have been a high likelihood of being rear-ended."
Yes he did.

"Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I have never seen anything that stated Tesla's Autopilot v1.0 is watching for brake lights - proximity to vehicles is radar-based."
Tesla will not accelerate on its own in the situation you just described.
Sounds like the one in mine...
"It is, it's the forward collision alert. "
Worst I have a 90D post ever :p
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnRp56XjV_M

You should try on your car."
"Those cars don't use radar to bounce underneath of the car in front of you and assess the situation ahead, like Tesla. They usually rely on one forward facing camera, only stopping when the situation is visible, instead of seeing it when it isn't "
New radar system can see 2 cars ahead. So the Tesla starts breaking as soon as the black car brakes which resulted in more time to stop safely.
"Simple brake lights do not trigger audible warnings.  Some people drive with both feet, leaving their brake lights on all the time.  

The warning was triggered because radar information showed that the vehicle was stopped and a collision was imminent."
The reddit algorithm doesn't show the exact number of up and down votes. It fuzzes them a little in either direction so bots can't tell if their constant voting is working. 
The front-facing radar apparently is able to see under the car immediately in front of it and detect slowdown in the car two cars ahead.
"No, the radar can actually see the car in front of the car in front of you. It bounces the radar under the car in front to see ahead. "
"In v8.0 they updated the radar to track 2 cars ahead to avoid this exact type of situation. https://www.tesla.com/blog/upgrading-autopilot-seeing-world-radar
"
"I'm not aware of any feature that judges appropriateness of merges and there are no audio sensors.

a radar processing update this year added the capacity to detect deceleration of vehicles 2 cars ahead by analysing radar reflections under and around the 1st car. 
too f-ing cool!"
"I've experienced a few crashes in Germany and two in the Netherlands. Every single time there were more people helping than necessary.

A big difference here in Germany is that the law encourages or even mandates helping, when there's a crash. You can not be sued for giving first aid, even if something goes wrong. And not helping after a crash can be a criminal offence, when the situation was reasonably safe for you and you still didn't stop. Helping can also just be warning other cars about the wreck ahead, so you're not required to do things you're mentally not able to do.

I've also lived in South East Asia and there it's a bit of a different story, because of the law. People tend to say that Asians or Chinese just drive past accidents and are cruel when it comes to other peoples lives. The truth is that frequently, the helper gets sued for what he did wrong or even for the crash itself. Especially if there are no other witnesses. As soon as you have a lot of people around a crash, like in central Bangkok, you have hordes of people helping. It's much more a problem with the law than with culture."
"Seems like a good place to put this reminder:

Everyone should take the time to go on a basic first aid course at least once in their life and then a refresher course every few years."
"That's completely false, video is (at time of posting) sitting at over +300 upvotes in /r/cars and people are certainly commenting on how impressive it is to see the vehicle ahead. https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/5kod3b/tesla_autopilot_predicts_crash_seconds_before_it/"
How on earth was this downvoted?!  It's literally exactly what we want cars to do these days! 
"Are ""other cars with collision avoidance"" bouncing radar **underneath** the car in front of them to detect a quickly decelerating vehicle two cars ahead?"
I test drove an s and it made (I think) that error sound when I pressed the brake and gas at the same time. Freaked me out.

"We don't need computer-driven cars to be perfect, they should just be better than humans."
"Eh, I think most people who argue about it just want to feel validated in their ICE that they recently purchased."
But not networked.
Anybody can download the computer programmes to edit the ECU right now. You can edit how basically anything in the car works (or doesnt work?) . It's scary shit and will definitely be a bigger problem in the future. Hopefully one we get around. 
"Redundancy can help deal with electronics that fail, and also let you constantly evaluate the circuit path for health.  A good system will also try to fail-safe, so that even a critical failure won't kill everyone.  Since you're physically moving the tires you will always have a mechanical system, it's just to what degree.

Having everything electronic is OK if the system is designed well."
"Hate to break it to you, but steer-by-wire has been a thing for a while now.  My 2010 VW GTI has an electric steering rack.

http://www.caranddriver.com/features/electric-vs-hydraulic-steering-a-comprehensive-comparison-test-feature"
"A well designed system in a critical application uses at dual modular redundancy. Or sometimes triple. 

This means you have two or three systems that both do all calculations and controls at the same time and check each other. If one fails, the other seamlessly takes over and an alarm goes off that service is needed. If those fail there typically is an emergency control system that has the bare minimum control software which takes over, just enough to maintain control functions. 

Airplanes use this. As do nuclear power plants (my reactor water level control system works this way). "
"Plus you usually get some warning before mechanical systems fail, like grinding/screeching.  An electronic systems just... stops working."
"At some point you've just gotta accept probability for what it is and let go. Yeah, I'd *feel* safer if my apartment building installed emergency parachute stations on every floor, but the resource and maintenance costs would be completely disproportionate to the chances that it would actually save my life some day."
"I agree with you, as well as a mechanical method of throwing the car into neutral (which is gone on a lot of current cars)."
"I've experienced a catastrophic failure of my mechanical brake system.

Seal in the master cylinder failed, causing it not to seal and thus actuate the brakes.  Came out of no where, braked fine every day for 2+ years and one day on the highway I hit the brakes and got nothing.

Fortunately was in a situation where I could slow down with the gears and handbrakes and pull over safely and not an emergency braking situation."
"I think your suggestions are ignoring that military aircraft since the 1970's don't even bother using this stuff. AFAIK, the last aircraft designed with mechanical redundancies was the A10. 

The reality is that we don't need mechanical redundancies as they just add extra weight and maintenance considerations. If you did a survey of 100,000 car crashes over years and across the world where the brakes failed, probably 99% would be improper maintenance of the brake pads, not controls failure. Keeping a mechanical emergency brake makes sense, but not for the driver's usual brake - fly by wire is fine."
Radar alerted a computer which started braking before the driver did
"Not sure that's what happened. The beeping goes off only after the car in front started to move to the right, revealing the car that had stopped hard. If it was actually viewing the cars ahead, it would have sounded off much sooner."
"It'll take a generation.  Maybe a generation and a half, due to ""generations"" being a fuzzy continuum thing.

Kids born today will see ""mature"" versions of Tesla cars in 16 years when they're ready to start driving, and will wonder WTF is wrong with everyone who doesn't see the logic in self-driving cars with better reaction times than any person can have.  Sure, sometimes a computer will fritz--but humans fritz all the time for *worse* and *stupider* reasons.  Software can be improved, but there'll always be a dumb human around.

It's like how landlines got replaced in a generation, and even desktop computers are replaced in many ways by smartphones and tablets.

If something's convenient--and spending a day drinking with your buddies and not having to worry about actually DRIVING home is convenient, not to mention having road-trips where everyone can play games the entire trip, or work travel where you can actually get work done in the vehicle--adoption will go very quickly regardless of old-timers dragging their heels and pining nostalgically for the good-ol-days.

Being driven places is also something children are used to, so being driven by your car when you're adult is a continuation of that, and ""comfortable"".  And once everyone is used to being driven, instead of driving, the old skills will die off, just like America doesn't have an easy way of imparting skills to drive a manual transmission if a person in particular has no immediate friends or family to teach them and can't (or won't) spend the money for a class."
"I'm sure that option will never go away. I just assume that way down the road... It's not going to be laws that you will have an issue with, it's going to be insurance companies jacking  up your rates the more you use manual mode. "
"By magically being able to tell that the car two cars ahead of you, which you can't see,  has slammed on it's brakes?"
"The car that caused the accident didn't even brake before hitting the SUV. It is reasonable to assume that any average driver would not have been prepared for this situation, as many drivers would have been looking for brake lights instead of looking further ahead at the traffic jam. Any good driver would have been able to react, but the average driver is not a good one."
"It even seems like the Tesla driver slows down a bit at the beginning. Driver to the left might have seen a bit past the car infront. Although the other driver sucks pretty hard, just ignoring the brake lights of the car ahead of them."
What does that mean?

"It's largely due to a much higher center of gravity that comes with increased ground clearance for SUVs.

But due to the battery packs in Teslas being built into the floor, their center of gravity is extremely low. In fact, the Model X has the lowest center of gravity in it's class. Apparently it's low enough that it reduces the risk of rollover by 50% simply due to the lower center of gravity. In fact, Tesla [wasn't able to flip](https://electrek.co/2016/03/07/tesla-flip-model-x-crash-tests-safety/) the Model X at all in their internal crash testing. The generally accepted industry crash testing groups like IIHS and NHTSA still haven't tested the Model X yet however."

"Damn LIDAR, I haven't heard that since my geology class"
"I watched it several more times, and you could be right. I have edited my comment. "
"That's what I see as well. You can see the SUVs brake lights through the red car least 2-3 seconds before the beeping, and I don't think the beep happened until the red car moved right and revealed the driver's side rear of the SUV.

I think it's more likely that the red car moved right and revealed a stopped object and that's what triggered the system, not radar reflections off the pavement looking 2 cars ahead like others are claiming."
"We don't need your validation, human. "
[May as well use the original reference.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7HmltUWXgs)
"Awesome! what if another car *behind* the Tesla was not braking, would the car accelerate to avoid being rear ended?"
"I'll only be impressed when it shoots a grappling hook into the car ahead and stops IT from getting in a accident too.

Telsa: cars so safe they prevent other car's accidents."
"The Corsa driver was changing lanes before the crash, and was most likely checking their blind spot. Probably didn't even see the other cars brake."
"If the car in front of you brakes sharply and you hit them, you were too close and are in the wrong "
"That's possible, still very stupid though. 

I know that if I need to stop that I always take great care not to break harder than necessary (and use up as much space as is safe between me and the care in front). 

And I've been in the situation where I hit the brakes before the people in front of me and seeing them crash. Looking a far ahead definitely helps prevent accidents. 

But I'd like to drive a tesla anyway. Although I wonder if it can do better than me if there is a van in front. Fast driving, left lane hogging van's are the worst to drive behind.  
"
"Seems like hazards would have been a good call for that SUV in front of you. That sounds scary, glad you're OK"
""
"So wait, did the Tesla brake itself, or did it disengage autopilot right before expecting the person to undertake a sudden and severe braking maneuver while potentially unaware of the situation?"
Tell them it killed a democrat.
"Ah yes, I remember when I was young and not jaded by years of watching the media's doom & gloom propaganda machine."
It's up now
or braking
"Yeah, it's just able to see and react to sudden speed changes 2 cars ahead.  /u/bjornnyland tested it and said it was able to react between 0.2 and 0.4 seconds faster than before.  Really cool stuff.

"Yeah I get that, and I know other cars are capable of this, I'm just more excited Tesla in general is making the front page for good news. The more people learn about Tesla, the better"
"I think what happened was they were changing lanes and didn't realize the rapid deceleration of the car ahead of it, and then got caught mid lane change. 

Nasty. "
"The black SUV started foot-off-accelerator slowing down, so the red car's driver was trying to change lanes, but was focussed on changing lanes and got caught by surprise when the black car's driver dropped the anchors."
"Yes, which is a *good* thing. This is particularly true for heavy vehicles like the Model S, since it can absorb more energy."
Maybe! There is no spoon!

"[nope, you are are wrong](http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/TECHNOLOGY/OVERVIEW/predictive.html)

My 2011 Acura has the system you are talking about, and Im sure it, and the Tesla like system were available in the MB S Class way before every other car, like all new tech in cars has been for the last 20 years."
Hopefully the Tesla doesn't start to break.
"True, but it's obvious the cars were already braking heavy and nearly at a standstill. The Tesla should be monitoring the hard deceleration and should have seen very heavy braking much sooner. These cars were going over 100kph. The stopping distance from 100 - 0 for SUVs and normal cars can be well over 30m.

The radar should have triggered the warning way sooner that it did if it had in fact been monitoring the situation ahead of the car. IMO it's not a coincidence that the warning started at nearly the instant the stationary cars were revealed. The cars were going very slow if not stationary before the car swerved. The Tesla merely suddenly saw a stationary object.

The collision was imminent much sooner than the Tesla reacted. I don't think the Tesla performed any better than any other collision warning systems found on other cars."

But why would they do that when they could mass poison people via our food/water systems?
Because terrorists aren't currently using cars to kill people?
Tell them that an autopilot truck couldnt have been used to kill in Berlin and Nice and watch their minds explode.
Just tell them their bank accounts can be hacked just as easy but the likelihood is so minimal that we're ok with putting our money in there. Driverless car hacking will be viewed the same. The convenience will outweigh the thought of hacking. 
"If every car on the road had collision avoidance I would be willing to bet that would not be the way a terrorist would do things. 1. It's not guaranteed death.  2. All manufacturers would use different systems.  3. You'd have to be in range of the vehicle.  4. You'd have to be in a high speed yet congested area to make it worth it (doesn't happen).    5. Most vehicles still require a human presence on the wheel.  
The people that have these fears are absolutely ignorant of what's involved.  If you feel you're being overtaken by vehicle terrorists, press the Damn brake and move over. You still have physical control of the machine. "
They do that already... Without hacking...
"There's one good rule in cybersecurity: if it exists, it can be hacked. It's only a matter of time. Perfect software does not exist.

Although I tend to have faith in Tesla with designing its systems, I definitely do **not** trust legacy manufacturers in this industry. Some have repeatedly shown not to give a shit about security and go out of their way to sue white hats. I just can't trust them with my life without proof that they actually made something good."

"Besides the ""and kill everyone"" part, is that such a ridiculous concern?"
Terrorists are already using cars to commit acts - no hacking needed.
"Self driving is pretty good and secure.   Sure, terrorists might utilize it.  But then they'd probably be pretty easy to track because that vehicles GPS data will likely be available and might reveal information about their organization.    

V2V might be hackable.   I hate that regulators passed a recommendation for this.  Hopefully that will get cancelled before it becomes rule.   It's an unnecessary attack vector that we don't need in order to get to L5 autonomy."
Cars now can be hacked.
"I love driving, I love my 1 year old WRX, I love having a manual transmission. Having said that, I got to drive my brothers model S over Christmas. Holy shit snacks what an amazing car.

I updated my response.  It is specifically the radar.   A laser system like Google and uber use would not see this. 
AP2 or next version was mentioned having radar bouncing for look ahead.... 
"That's what happened.  If you could see the dash, you'd see the rendering of the two cars. The one in front (the SUV) would be blinking red because it was going too slow.

"The option to drive manually on public roadways might well go away.  Nobody will stop you from driving manual at a purpose-specific track, or your own farm."
I could see the brakes through the window on the video before the collision occurred.

"No, by seeing that a car accident is happening in front of you and then hitting the brakes, not even really slamming them since there was plenty of space.

Do people on this subreddit not actually drive? Just order a Tesla to look at in their garage?"
"> It is reasonable to assume that any average driver would not have been prepared for this situation, as many drivers would have been looking for brake lights instead of looking further ahead at the traffic jam.

"Both drivers were in the wrong.  The black SUV was tailgating the car in front of him which forced him to brake hard when traffic stopped.

The corsa driver was tailgating while completely unable to see what traffic ahead of the black SUV looked like.  To make it worse, he sped up to try pass the car in the right lane.

The corsa driver is a huge idiot for taking the risk he did knowing he had no idea what traffic looked like ahead of the SUV.  I would hope the corsa driver is facing a criminal charge for what he did.

The black SUV isn't legally responsible, but certainly could have prevented the accident by not tailgating.  Defensive driving is a thing and people need to practice it.  Part of good driving is to drive in a way that helps prevent other people around you from harming you with their stupidity."

"Just speculating here, but based on the sound:

1. Emergency braking engages (autopilot still engaged)
2. Driver ALSO slams on brakes after hearing the alarm
3. Autopilot disengages since driver took over

It's worth noting that emergency braking will only slow the car down by up to 25 mph."
Watch the hood line vs the road in the youtube video. The Tesla started braking simultaneously with the sound of the first beep of the warning tone.
In this case both. /s

Changing lanes and looking in their right rear view mirror so they didn't see the car in the left lane braking. Two bad drivers there.

Tesla's self-driving abilities will be carried out by a completely sandboxed computer - completely separate from the infotainment system. Obviously you're gonna get cybersecurity issues when you tie the driving system to the internet-connected media console...

It's not likely that your car is networked like you said in your comment.
"Maybe not.  If it's hacked, you might not be able to kill the engine.  In fact, it might accelerate.  And since we have self-driving, it could actively fight you on steering.  Mechanical brakes would eventually win, but if the motors are trying hard, it's going to take a while.

Allowing electrical control instead of mechanical has trade offs, to be sure.  "

"So why isn't it beeping when you can clearly see the heavy braking going on through the window?

The beeping should have been happening a lot sooner. Watch the video and skim it slowly. You'll see it only starts beeping once the car begins to move right, revealing the stopped car in front which the Tesla is detecting."
"So why isn't the Tesla beeping when the cars are obviously already stopped? The cars were at more or less of a standstill before the car swerved, hence why it swerved. The Tesla didn't start beeping right until the car move aside and revealed the stationary object? Doesn't seem like a coincidence."

"first off, it would have to be cheaper for retrofit driverless features to become more affordable than it would be to pay a higher premium on insurance before we could get enough of the billions of cars on the road to change to make that law happen. so you are talking about a law that's at least 20 years away from even being remotely considered. so let's say that does happen and we get a cash for clunkers concepts... still can't get all those shit cars off the road even 10 years later... so let's assume 20 years from now that we can even start to retrofit all those cars to create a law like that would take at least another 20 years before it becomes viable.

"Not sure if you watched the video with the sound on.  The Tesla alerted the driver well before the collision occurred.  Not reacting until the car in front of you is flipping would send the average driver into a panic, where it's very likely they would have slammed on the brakes, causing ABS to kick in and increasing the likelihood that they themselves would have gotten rear ended by the vehicle behind them, causing what occurred to the SUV to happen to them as well.  It's real easy to play armchair quarterback from behind a keyboard, but it's a whole other thing to be there in the driver's seat.

I disagree. The same argument could be made about things like improved brakes or better brake lights. The benefit to Tesla is improved sales due to their vehicles having lower insurance rates."
"Now I want a Tesla, time to start saving."
"Too be fair, the tesla driver was not tailgating and would have been able to stop using only human reaction time.

The reason the other two cars hit is because they were both tailgating.  The black SUV ignored sensible defensive driving by tailgating which forced him to slam his breaks to stop.  The guy behind him tailgating couldn't see any traffic around the bigger SUV at all so he had no idea traffic was stopping ahead as he tried to cut into the right lane so when the SUV broke hard, he didn't have a chance at all.

The guy in the black SUV is not at fault by law, but I would bet anyone would agree that it would have been better for the black SUV driver to not tailgate and brake hard just so a bad driver behind him won't cause an accident like this."

Demo of the Tesla demonstrating it's ability to use radar to detect braking of a car outside of it's direct line of sight: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG3Jp5GyPoc

**Engineering explanation:** The pulse from the FMCW radar unit on the front of the hood hits the road under the first car in front, reflects off the 2nd car ahead which is outside the radar's line of sight, the pulse reflects and returns by the same path.  The sudden reduction of time it takes the pulse to return to the radar unit can be calculated, trends observed to detect that some object in front of the visible car is decelerating.  Picture of the radar unit: http://www.k40radar.com/Content/Images/uploaded/TESLA%20K40%20RADAR%20RL360i%20LASER%20DEFUSER%20G5%20FRONT%20CIRCLED.jpg

Tesla should get a reward from the insurance agencies of the cars involved in the pileup (and ones behind for not being involved in it) for every time a Tesla car is the first car to put an end to 5 to 100 car human caused pileup.

Does this mean the Tesla safety rating should be greater than the best rating, since Teslas prevent interstate pileups caused by human drivers?  Not only is the car safe, but bad human drivers are safer just having them around.

The type of radar unit used is a trade secret, it's probably something like FMCW radar: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous-wave_radar"

I disagree on this one. Sure it takes just a quick glance, if there are no cars behind you, but if you see cars behind, you gotta watch them for a while longer to determine if they are not closing in too fast.

"I can tell by your dismissive attitude that you don't really have much experience in digital security.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending the ignoramuses in the media circus trying to scare up stories about subject matter they don't understand, nor am I saying we should fight off the advent of self driving vehicles.

That being said, it is becoming painfully obvious to many people in the industry that people and corporations are not taking digital security seriously. We're talking about a society that still uses a number as proof of identification which you hand out to no less than 30 different corporations without a second thought about their security practices.

The concern about digital security with respect to self driving cars is not misguided. Instead it should be recognized as a warning: we either take digital security seriously now or learn these lessons the hard way.

Fact is, digital security always ultimately comes down to how well you can keep a piece of digital information a secret. Digital signatures and encryption are all that stand in the way from unauthorized OTA updates. They all rely on a private key remaining private. Even worse, once these pieces of information leak you can't know if that's what happened or if someone gained physical access to carry out the attack. Furthermore, as the potential rewards for a successful attack rise so do the sophistication of the attacks. Identity theft is pretty easy but only the easiest targets ever get hit because the economics of carrying out anything but the cheapest vector doesn't make any economic sense. Controlling a car? Anyone's car? That could be very very profitable.

I know this last statement is going to draw some skepticism but if you want to understand how hard it is to keep a digital secret all you have to do is read about some of the hacks that have been carried out against cryptocurrency users and exchanges. Ponzi scheme or no, this is the most visible current forefront of practical digital security. (Absolute forefront being military digital hardware)"
How is it sandboxed when you can control your vehicle from the same screen which you control your media and climate?  
Now package that in the way the dumbest person you know can understand it and not be afraid.
I think this risk will be eliminated by a manual override. People do not have to worry.
"I keep seeing people posting this video as proof of Tesla's security, I am sorry to say that it is not.  
1. Tesla's system has been hacked by a Chinese team a while ago, they did not need physical access. The vulnerability is not patched.  
2. Even on the linked video, the presenters clearly state that there may be vulnerabilities in the CAN controller."
They physical plugged a device into the ODBII port. Anything can be compromised with physical access.
Ohh look an idiot who doesnt use any sort of add blocking software.
"No. But maybe someone he and a hundred other people support politically coincidentally dies because their car mysteriously decided to drive off a cliff. Political status quo is preserved and anybody calling for an investigation into the circumstances is dismissed as a conspiracy nut. A la ""can't we just drone this guy?"""
"I'm with you except for the fact I hate my commute. Gridlocked Bay Area traffic is the exact opposite of meditative. I might not go so restrictive as to say ""public roads"" for auto pilot but basically city-freeway-interstate mandatory autopilot. Highways and rural roads are fair game."
"It's going to be a long time before they become cheap enough that the poor can afford them. Until that time, a measure that drastic would be devastating and probably the first time we banned previously road legal cars."
"> not likely that your car is networked like you said in your comment

I didn't say it was networked...  ?"
A mechanical kill switch on the dash might solve this issue.  Put it under a transparent flip-up dome so that you can't hit it by accident.
"I'm not saying it's in the short term future, so I don't disagree with any of your points on how long it might take, but I suspect it will be within many of our lifetimes.

I see it happening piecemeal, not all at once, as well.  We already have specific lanes that are for reserved for use by carpools or low emission vehicles.  It'd make even more sense to have lanes reserved for autonomously driving vehicles, so the cars could drive much more closely to each other and get higher throughput.  So self-driving cars will have access to better and faster routes, and they start to take over on those merits.  Eventually, most of the cars on the road are autonomous, and the now-deprecated manual cars find a diminishing number of roadways they can even still use.  I don't ever see retrofitting happening for most of the vehicles on the road now; it's just too hard, and usually not worth it."
">Sorry, but if you slow down the frame rate of the video you will see this sequence.

The 4 beep audio warning happens after the brake lights are visible. Is there another warning sound that I'm missing?"
"Me thinks you're blind, friend. The brake lights are visible well before the audio beeps. Nothing against self-driving cars, but if I were in this situation I (keyword) likely would have braked well before the beeps happened."
"> Sorry, but if you slow down the frame rate of the video you will see this sequence.
> Audio warning then 0.4 seconds later, the brake light becomes visible.

Apparently you are failing to see the brakes light that come on 3 seconds before the Tesla's warning sound (just like the driver). Brake lights for the SUV come on at 2 seconds, the audible warning is at 5 seconds: http://sendvid.com/282crfpv

It's really not that hard to pay attention to the traffic in front of you.  You should be constantly looking around / through / under the vehicle in front of you."
[deleted]
"I replied to you once already, but seriously are we watching different videos?  The vehicle two in front of the Tesla had its brake lights on for 3 full seconds before the audible warning from the Tesla.  It's great that the Tesla has these features, but at this point it's not better than a competent driver."
"Did not know the Tesla alerted the driver ahead of time. That is awesome. Doesn't change the fact that you don't need to see two cars ahead of you to keep a safe distance and use your brakes. I honestly can't wrap my head around how in fuck's name you could watch this clip and then try to argue that would have been a difficult accident to avoid. Maybe the ""average driver"" would have had trouble with it but the average driver would literally drive off a cliff if some poorly-designed traffic engineering told them to. I can't honestly see anyone I've ridden with having trouble with this scenario though, even my mom or idiot teenage friends. I've seen some of the shittiest drivers I know handle much more difficult situations than this. I honestly can't fathom what's wrong with y'all's brains that makes this look difficult to you. The only part of your comment that makes a lick of sense is that the average driver would have stopped harder and might have gotten rear-ended. I'm not denying it's a good idea to have computers drive since they can do shit like calculate exact braking levels for a given distance much more easily than humans can. But you're either hallucinating or extremely misanthropic/pessimistic/cynical if you think the average driver couldn't have stopped in time for what happened ahead in this video. Or maybe drivers here in upstate NY are superhuman and what I think of as a shitty driver is the best of the best in your area. I doubt that though."
[deleted]
"No, there's clearly a middle ground between ""magically being able to tell that the car two cars ahead of you, which you can't see, has slammed on its brakes"" and everybody paying attention all the time and always being good drivers. That middle ground happens to be real life, where the average person pays attention enough of the time that they wouldn't have needed magic second-car-sensing abilities to have avoided the accident. What's so complicated about this to you?"
"It's probably an averaged (last 1s maybe) speed listed, not immediate."
"The time resolution on the speed indicator is super low, and looks like it averages out over a few samples.  Kinda makes me wonder if those kinds of videos are really admissible in courts (obviously would depend on jurisdiction)."
"It's too late fam, stop, drop, and roll"

"> (remember, it's legal and not uncommon in some places in Europe) 

It's legal in exactly one place and that's Germany. And even in Germany you don't have to worry about 300km/h on the right side, because nobody is that braindead to go that fast in that lane unless it's completely empty, otherwise it's not even possible because of all the trucks in that lane. Even in that video there is very little traffic otherwise the car would not be doing 160 in the right lane. And oh then there is the whole not overtaking on the right thing, which you would only do if you already notice something is strange and slow down. "
And in 3 seconds the guy in front of you slammed on his brakes and you died RIP
I agree
Seems they introduced it to their 16/17 vehicles
Ah. Got it. lol
Fair enough. I appreciate the heads up!  
"I would imagine official Tesla updates are encrypted and require a checksum, among other software security mechanisms, which together would effectively block out unofficial software from the computer (although I could be wrong)"

"Very detailed explanation of [How to hack a Tesla Model S](https://youtu.be/KX_0c9R4Fng)

TL/DW: it can be done, with physical access inside the car and by tearing up a few panels, you can get to a port which can be hacked. By the way, the hackers reported the vulnerabilities and those were quickly patched OTA.

If you watch the video, you get the clear impression Tesla had security in mind when designing this data center on wheels they call a Model S. Very impressive stuff."
Computer researchers have been trying to hack Tesla since they started making cars and so far they haven't been able to break in except in highly improbably scenarios. Tesla has done a really good job 
Someone could string a wire over the interstate at just the right height where it could cut the heads off of ME AND ALL MY PASSENGERS
"Fair point. I was actually referring to the self-driving computer (Nvidia's SoC) in AP HW2 cars, which is sandboxed. The current remote abilities, like what you linked to and Summoning from the app, do require internet connectivity. I assume Tesla is going all-in on cybersecurity as a result."
"That also means that in theory, every car can be hacked, fleetwide, in a matter of hours! "
Unfortunately OTA updates lead to their own set of potential security issues... And on a much wider scale.
"Theoretically, yes, though more realistically, a matter of days. "
"Not really needed.  If a cop car stops in front, the autopilot car stops. Reckless driving is difficult. 

Tesla cars would make ~~horrible~~ hilarious getaway cars. "
"they weren't able to make apple give them a backdoor into all phones I dont think they will be able to do that either
"
Well said.
"Code is signed by a private key that is kept within the walls of the company, it is never distributed to the end points. This key is unlikely to leak, but even if it does it can be immediately revoked and replaced by a new key generated from the master certificate which is locked away in a safe which can only be accessed by high level execs

OTA Updates are perhaps the least likely vector of successful attack. "
Sandboxed does not mean there is no communication outside the sandbox. It means such communication is very limited to the absolute necessary.
"""Internet connectivity can only be done wirelessly or through a wire. Imagine a computer with no WiFi or 4G chip, and no wired connection, protecting your car from hackers - it's like a house with no doors, windows, or any other openings whatsoever.""

There you go :)"
"I never meant it as proof that Tesla's are impregnable, no system is, I just meant it to say that Tesla's are far and away more secure than Jeeps. 

Yes the Tesla was remotely hacked, but it was patched, and it wasn't a ""true"" remote hacking, the car had to have been connected to a malicious hotspot for them to gain access. If they could get in through the cell connection, or if they could find a way to spoof the service center hotspot and make the car connect to it automatically, then it will be big.

""Within just 10 days of receiving this report, Tesla has already deployed an over-the-air software update (v7.1, 2.36.31) that addresses the potential security issues,"" Tesla said in response. ""The issue demonstrated is only triggered when the web browser is used, and also required the car to be physically near to and connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot. Our realistic estimate is that the risk to our customers was very low, but this did not stop us from responding quickly."""
There's also no such thing as a nation-wide ballot measure.

"> The 4 beep audio warning happens after the brake lights are visible. Is there another warning sound that I'm missing?

I'm not hearing any other audio sound, either.  The brake lights come on 3 seconds before the Tesla beep."
Thank you.  I really don't see how other people are not seeing this?
"This entire video is framed so that you're watching for the accident.  I think we can honestly say that we don't expect that kind of stop to occur suddenly on a freeway.  We try to watch for it and prepare by trying to maintain a larger following distance than the driver in this video did but I know that any number of things can prevent any human driver from noticing the brake lights through the next car.  If the car ahead had a heavily tinted rear windshield, you'd have little chance here.

I say the car's safety system in addition to the driver's vigilance is key here.  "
"> The problem is driving shouldn't be considered something anyone can do.

Amen."
r/iamverysmart
"> Did not know the Tesla alerted the driver ahead of time. That is awesome.

It didn't.  Brake lights were on for 3 seconds prior to the audible warning from the Tesla."
"I think you're missing the point. Yes, most humans would have been able to avoid this, but if things would have been slightly different, would they?

The reaction time is not comparable. At 60mph, 1 second takes you 88 feet further. A human literally could not have reacted as fast as the computer because they wouldn't be able to see what was happening with their eyeballs.

On top of that, we're talking about ""most people"" vs. ""everyone"". If you're a great driver, good for you. If everyone was, we probably wouldn't need automated cars. But they aren't.

And even the best drivers get tired, lazy, or distracted and these things just don't.

This video is nothing more than an amazing look at what this system is capable of."
"Well, you do technically take your eyes off the road whenever you look through your mirrors, such as in changing lanes. 

Humans cannot look in all directions at all times which makes computers so much more attractive. 

But I agree it's quite crazy how many people just look around, fidget, and stare at their passengers when conversing while they drive. "
"> It just blowns my mind that people actually drive without paying attention all the time.

If you think it's bad now, try riding a motorcycle for a few years.  Your disdain for the average driver will go through the roof."

Accidents happen for the most part because of human error. Automation takes that aspect away."
"The IIHS are the people that designate vehicles as ""top safety picks"" or ""top safety pick+"" and the like. Their branding isn't that great. Haha"
"Yeah, definitely. The Bel/Escort built-in radar detectors include an okay set of LIDAR jammers, but there are a couple others that are even better. I had the full set on my BMW, but my Tesla is a lease and installing it was going to be expensive. So far so good. "
Absolutely. I think I replied to the wrong comment.
[deleted]
"Sure, I agree with you, but I'm not talking about this particular Tesla situation (from left lane to right lane, yada yada). My point is, changing lanes is always a little risky, and just a ""**quick** glance"" at mirror / over shoulder doesn't mitigate that risk completely."
"Unless there is some vulnerability that allows them to bypass that check. Playstation 3, Xbox 360, iPhones, etc all work that way and have been hacked anyway."
"Tesla have enough people from the software world that I assume they've done this, but it's not a panacea.  There is still the possibility of stolen keys (rare, but not unheard of), vulnerabilities in the signature check (both Kindle and Android have had flawed signature checks), and/or vulnerabilities in Tesla's drive software or any other system that can communicate with the update system or the drive system in any way."
"Anything connected to the Internet is vulnerable to hacking. It may take many years for people to find a way in, but there is always a way. If a really good hacker bought a Tesla and took it apart, they could figure out what the car checks for in updates, and then send it something it thinks is real."
"And how secure are Tesla's servers?

And we're talking about Tesla here, a company that's mainly a Silicon Valley company. Imagine what a mess there must be at other car companies when it comes to this issue."
"There is no way to prevent hacks with 100% success. Hacker only has to succeed once. Tesla has to succeed 100% of the time.

Regardless, all that matters is that despite hacking possibilities, its still safer than driving by yourself. You cannot eliminate all risk, only decrease it."
Just out of curiosity — do you know what SoC exactly Autopilot 2.0 Hardware is using?
"There's plenty of critical systems that send out information to the rest of the world that would be terrible if hacked (GPS, Windows updates, etc), but securing a single site that uploads that information to the rest of the world is much easier and can be verifiably secured. In the case of GPS, only the Air Force can upload data to the satellites from an Air Force base in Colorado Springs using an encrypted channel. You'd have to have physical access to those computers to have any chance of uploading bogus ephemeris to the satellites.

While Microsoft and Tesla may not be able to secure their facilities as well as the military can, it's probably good enough to require physical access to do any harm and have several layers of security that even if you had physical access, you still wouldn't be able to send anything out by yourself.

Edit: Also, it gives Tesla the ability to immediately patch any potential vulnerabilities in their AI or in security immediately. That's an extremely useful tool as it can be difficult to force drivers to return to dealerships to update the firmware in their cars."
Only if unauthenticated but they are. They've been code signed since day one and an update a year or so ago began enforcing signature validity (as a result of a Defcon talk).
Any car has to stop at some point anyways. I guess it's gonna take some patience to pull someone over.
Let's hope!
They already have apple backdoored through prism. Snowden proved that.  Tim cook was just trying to make headlines  & play the privacy advocate.  He doesn't give a shit about your privacy.
"You realise that all these keys have been leaked in the past, right? Not Tesla's keys per se, but they *were* leaked. The privacy of the key is a massive weak point, in fact, it is so massive that I am fully convinced it was an engineered weak point."

Why would there be unnecessary communications happening? 
You need to meet some dumber people
"Wirelessly or through a wire? 

That pretty much covers everything then. :P "
"The ""malicious hotspot"" is very easy to create, just use the right SSID. Yes the risk was low, as Tesla says, but the consequences were extremely serious and the vulnerabilities that lead to this were more like gaping holes that should not be there in the first place. "
"even if it was a statewide thing, the same problems exist."
"Good point.  I guess it depends on the aforementioned speculative regulation, or if it's seen as enough of a desirable feature by people that will never quite trust autonomous cars anyway.  A lot of people ultimately do want to be in control, and don't want to give that up.  A kill switch would be the last hurrah, especially considering that cars at some point will no longer have manual controls."

"It's an amazing video no doubt with the information that the car warned the driver ahead of time, but I'm not ""missing the point."" The person I replied to did indeed seem to imply that it was somehow impossible for a normal human driver to avoid this accident. That is not actually the case. Obviously the car could avoid some accidents that humans can't, but the average human could also avoid some accidents that the car at this stage can't. In this case it's pretty much a normal everyday situation (something unexpected happens to the car in front of you and they decelerate at slow enough rate to account for with normal braking and reaction time from your distance) and any normal driver would have been fine here. It doesn't take a great driver to brake in time for what happened in this situation. "
"Nobody knows how many car accidents there are each year. I don't see how that changes the known facts of the video we just watched.

Astounding. It would seem your work here is done, Sherlock Holmes."

"[It's a bit old, but this video goes pretty in depth about trying to hack a Model S. They delve into the firmware updates too.](https://youtu.be/KX_0c9R4Fng?t=25m33s)

TL:DW: It's difficult, requires physical access, and Tesla already patched a lot of the vulnerabilities they used to gain access to the car's systems."
Those hacks required physical access to the machine correct? Not really feasible in a mass Tesla sabotage plan.
I'm hoping they put a dead man's switch in place. If shit gets hacked they send out a signal and message to all cars and drivers. To drive their own car. Yes it's not a failsafe but it could easily prevent a terrorist attack. Just tossing out ideas 
Nvidia PX2 is the drive SoC but I am not sure what SoC the infotainment system is using.
"I agree it is useful, and it is definitely the way forward. I'm simply attempting to highlight that the challenges are non-trivial and need to be extensively thought through - you can't simply say ""its sandboxed"" and then put your head in said sand.

Assuming, Tesla can keep their infrastructure secure, imagine something such as this:
-someone gets root access to their own car or a wrecked car they purchased (some people already have root on their centre consoles - I assume its harder to root the actual AI controller)
- with root access manage to break encryption codes or find some other flaw.
- using a device such as a stringray that law enforcement uses to perform a man in the middle attack.

Obviously I've no idea how feasible this really is, but Tesla, and probably more worryingly, companies such as Jeep who are not renowned for their digital security practices will need put a lot of effort into this field."
"Didn't really work against Apple.

I'm all for sensible paranoia but this is not... it's just tin-foil-hat nonsense."
"Alright, let me try again.

""You have a house. House has no doors, no windows, no chimney. How can robbers get in? They can't.""

:P"
"It's a fair point, but I imagine the scenario is pie-in-the-sky enough that poor people driving outdated cars might not even be an issue by the time it came to pass.

What I imagine as more likely is that, as autopilot becomes more accepted and normalized, the concept of car ownership will give way to on-demand use of car-shares, membership pools, or even municipal/public fleets.

I have little to base this on beyond my imagination, but as the marketplaces and infrastructures develop, I imagine a subscription/pass for *average* daily use of a public or on-demand car will eventually be much cheaper than the average cost of ownership.

"
My reply was heavy-handed then.  My apologies.  Carry-on good sir.
You sound mad bro. 
">  and Tesla already patched a lot of the vulnerabilities they used to gain access to the car's systems.

You make it sound like that solved the security issues forever. It solved *those issues*, but just like those issues existed, there would be other like it.

Only time will tell, but it would be a fool's errand to bet *against* security vulnerabilities existing.

"
A Chinese team hacked the Tesla's system without physical access. The vulnerability is now patched.
Kid almost wipes out @46:10
"Most of those did, but Android and Kindle have both had flawed signature checks that did not require physical modification."
"Physical hacks are just one example.

Really all it shows is that there are multiple attack vectors and the low hanging fruit have been nabbed for that specific software version. Not really much more.

Tesla takes their security quite seriously though."
Exactly. So they fuck with one car. It's no different than cutting brake lines. But overall the care is orders of magnitude safer. People need to relax 
"There will always be a vulnerability.  The thing about security is that it is never the end all be all.  There is always a way in, it you're dedicated enough, you can figure a way in."
Just have it done at superchargers. . . 
I'm don't believe it's changed from the Tegra 3 that's in the rest of the fleet.  Tegra 2 for the instrument cluster.
"I doubt that it's possible to completely secure the car itself if a hacker has unlimited physical access to it. Does that really need to be the goal though? Any car in the world can be sabotaged if somebody can get access to it for as long as they want.

I think the goal needs to be making it impossible to *remotely* cause harm to a car and impossible to quickly hack it if you have fleeting physical access to it (such as by walking by it in a public space). That should be an achievable goal and the one to strive for. If a VIP is concerned about their security, then they'd definitely need to keep any car they ride in secure at all times just as they would today.

I think if it was as secure as your standard console system, requiring a chip to be soldered on to bypass its software validation routines, that should be good enough so long as the location where the chip would need to be placed is deep within the car and impossible to access without disassembling several portions of the car."
"By people that generally don't understand actual information security, at that."
They brute force a wall down. 
What a fucking incredible observation. I'm glad I took the time to read it. You really ended the thread with that one. 
">  and Tesla already patched a lot of the vulnerabilities **they** used to gain access to the car's systems.

Could've been clearer, but I meant the vulnerabilities the guys in the video used have since been patched. Nobody's saying that their system is perfect and without holes, that's just stupid. It's a cat and mouse game, but Tesla is certainly better prepared to handle bug fixes than many other car companies."
"Unlike other most cars, Tesla can actually send updates to regularly patch those holes. "
Do we know how?
"I agree, but this is hard enough to discourage attempts."
"I'm pretty sure that's not feasible either, pretty sure the stations have at least security cameras. You can't plug your laptop in and start hacking for a few hours."
"Makes sense. It works well, so continue using it to lower the cost over the long term."
/r/iamverysmart
"Yes, search around. Sorry I'm on mobile. "
Well I like to think its somewhat plausible if you can intercept the GSM signal the car receives.
"You can't intercept it? It's still going to get to the car, unless you put the car in a Faraday cage, perform your manipulations, and then rebroadcast the signal."
"Jammers work better, its pretty easy to jam a cell signal."
You can't intercept and jam the same signal.
"True. I just remember reading about [this antenna](http://gizmodo.com/5601826/this-1500-system-can-intercept-your-cellphone-calls) that would jam the 3G signal so that the receiver would fall back to the less secure 2G/GSM, that it would then intercept. "
2g is being taken offline in the us as we speak though. So not sure that attack vector is feasible either.
Hmm. I never thought about that. Most carriers ARE doing that by January 1st. Neat.
