**Elon:**
> It certainly needs to be better & we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives & reduces injuries should be released.

">The 28-year-old driver of the car told police in South Jordan, a suburb of Salt Lake City, that the Autopilot system was switched on and that she had been looking at her phone before the crash.

"Correct me if I’m wrong, but wasn’t this truck at a red light? If the truck wasn’t there, she could have killed someone flying through the intersection. Get off your damn phone lady. "
"This crash was local to me, and was covered on the nightly news. My boyfriend was like, “if a car crashes it causes traffic, if a Tesla crashes it causes news.” We agreed that the only thing that should be news is the part that they walked away from a 60mph-to-stop crash with only a broken ankle. That in and of itself is mighty fine safety advertising if you ask me. 

Editing to add: the road this crash was on is one that autopilot should NOT have been used on. It is not a freeway, stop lights every few miles, constant construction and construction debris to dodge... not a good road for AP. "
"Live by the sword, die by the sword.  Tesla gets an assload of free publicity for everything they do, that comes in good and bad forms."
It made news because it is *another* retard who thinks autopilot is real. Tesla needs to change the name if they want to avoid any more bad publicity because they don't educate their drivers on how the fucking car works.

That truck is even more amazing. I don't even see any dents on it after hitting by a heavy Tesla running at 60 MPH.
[deleted]
"This line is from the beginning of a 2016 Tesla-produced “Paint it Black” AutoPilot video. You can’t, as a company, tell people that the car does the driving and then have a car drive itself at 60-mph into a stopped fire truck and be upset when the media reports on it.

“The person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.”

As for the NHTSA statistics being used to say that Teslas result in 4x fewer fatal accidents, the data set used includes motorcycles (which account for less than ~1% of the miles driven but over 13% of the fatalities) so it is hard to make definitive conclusions.

I’m happy the woman in the accident is going to be okay and has nothing more than a broken ankle."
[deleted]
What a crock of shit. If the accident happened because the brakes didn't engage you bet your ass it'd be front page news.
"Personally, I think it's super messed up that Elon Musk claims his cars are the safest on the road using misleading statistics.

https://twitter.com/hoonable/status/996123038965030912"
"Glass houses and all that.  Elon is making outrageous promises of full self driving aaaaany day now.  Most experts think it is at least 10 years away.  So when accidents like this happen, that is pretty far away from FSD aaaaany day now.  FSD should make this basically impossible.  So more proof of what knowledgeable people on the subject already know, that we are a long long long ways away from FSD.

So if Elon is going to make such unrealistic claims of how close to FSD they are, he shouldn't be surprised by blowback like this and claim it's unfair criticism.  

I'm a fan but not a fanboy.  I think even the fanboys can agree that he tends to be quite unrealistic on his timelines.  I think his FSD aaaany day now timeline is the most unrealistic of all."
I do think it's scary how awful Tesla's autopilot seems to be at detecting stationary objects though. I don't think *enough* attention is paid to how misleading Tesla is about its self-driving capabilities. 
"No it's not. Tesla is a new company, this is a new technology, the scrutiny and criticism it's receiving is well-justified. "
"Self driving cars are a new technology, so we should hold it to very high standards. If we start saying it's ok for self driving cars to kill people just because non self driving cars kill far more then investors will take it as an invitation to cut corners. "
It's not messed up that a Tesla slamming into a stopped fire truck with AP engaged makes the news. Self driving cars are new. Crashes will make the news.
"Correction: ""It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news, *for anything other than how miraculous that is*, and the \~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage."""
10 self driving Tesla's on the road....millions of cars
"Not really crazy. While the Model T was revolutionizing transportation, I bet there was a lot of horseback riding accidents and injuries that went unnoticed. The first automobile accident was front page news. I'm glad I'm around to witness history. "
"I'm fucking tired of cutting people out of cars.

I'm fucking tired of working a code you can't save, while their mom's calling.

I'm fucking tired of handing off pieces of my patients to Airlift.

I'm fucking tired of working all night in miserable weather because some fucks-stick decided the laws of physics don't apply to them. 

I'm fucking tired of asshole drivers yelling at us to open the highway because some other fucking asshole driver decided to smash 6 cars in a tunnel.

I'm fucking tired of working for hours and hours on end  to clean up multi-car pileups for free. 
 
Humans are terrible drivers. 
"
They said the same thing when cars were invented and suddenly nobody cared about horse and buggy accidents. Welcome to the world. 
"From IIHS ( http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/driver-death-rates … ), death rates for 2012-2015 midsize vehicles was 30/1M vehicle years.  At 12000mi/yr, this is 30/12B miles or 1 fatality every 400M miles.
Thus average newish/midsize car is SAFER than larger, heavier, luxury Tesla"
There were 3 local news segments about non-tesla cars on fire last 2 weeks. Tesla car crashes and catches on fire... National News and talk about all these faliures... WTF
Cry me a river. 
What's even more amazing is that they say they don't know if the autopilot was engaged but write an article effectively blaming it anyway.
"""super messed up.""

This is what journalism has been like for a decade?"
"Seriously? Have you watched local news? Shit, just Google ""car crash"" and you get a ton of articles that are a few hours old.

Are you Tesla fan boys starting to get worried that maybe, just maybe, Elon is spending more energy on sweet fucking comebacks on Twitter instead of making a profitable company? I mean he can barely handle a simple earnings call.

Twitter game is sick though!"

"Do you really want your news to be all about random car crashes?
Also of course it would be headline. It's groundbreaking technology in it's infancy.
Also, 40,000 includes people of all income, teens, drunks, etc. I bet Tesla demographics mostly includes mature drivers who has disposable income and are most probably very careful about their luxary cars. "
"Drove past an accident yesterday where the car caught on fire. All I could think was ""if that was a Tesla, it'd've been front page news."""
[removed]
Yeah it's super unfair when an car maker injures a consumer and it might be the fault of the car rather than the driver and they blame them.  Poor multimillion dollar companies.
"Humans always do this. 
""Oh wow, this 1 thing will solve a huge problem""

1 day later
""That 1 thing caused a minor inconvenience to 1 person. It's so and so fault. Horrible idea""

Unless the idea is perfect. Or its flaws land under human error. No one will ever accept it's better to have. I know some people will go to extreme lengths blaming someone else or something instead of accepting a small error on their part. "
"However, it seems that the emergency braking on teslas seems to be not working that well.  Killing that guy on the divider without the safety thing and now slamming into the back of a firetruck without braking at all.  Obviously there's user error, but the safety systems should still work.   What if the person had a medical emergency instead of just not paying attention?

I thought regardless of whether you had autopilot engaged, it should still do emergency braking, no?"
"The issue is not with Tesla, it's to do with society's baby steps towards autonomous tech. Every accident involving an autonomous car will be news for obvious reasons. As hopeful as I am about the tech, the real issue is the leap of trust involved. 

"
"The media is a commercial enterprise, bought and paid for by commercial enterprises. "
"Yes! I am sick of hearing ""Tesla motors recovering from ***yet another fatal accident***, could this be the end of Tesla?""

Like my goodness man. Anyone who does not really follow what happened is going to think that Tesla is a terrible car"
"Why is it messed up? Tesla is a new manufacturer and people are interested in how it performs. Most people can think critically. Just because one headline says ""broken ankle in a Tesla"" doesn't mean they think it's an unsafe car automatically. It just say Teslas are not fail safe, which is good to know if you're going to buy one."
People don't care about life. They care about scandal.

Well when you swing your dick around all the time you're gonna get attention. Good and bad. You can take it Elon come now
"It's super messed up that Elon Musk is an anti-union Ayn Rand fanboy, who overworks and underpays his employees."
[deleted]
"I’m a huge fan of Tesla, but their media coverage is brought about on their own. Elon is very good at marketing and touting his brands. Unfortunately, that means they are going to see some press coverage when bad things like this happen. Especially given the atmosphere we are in with them being a leader in autonomous vehicles. There was plenty of coverage when that Uber vehicle hit a pedestrian a while back as well...it’s just where we are with the technology."
"My in-laws have been in 3 human error caused accidents in the last 6 months (none of them their fault, or so they say). One was even hit by a cement truck with a full load who ran a red light (he couldn’t stop in time). Auto-pilot would probably have prevented all 3 accidents, as there was some pretty crappy driving involved. We need self driving cars."
"That isn't a reason to **not** report an accident in a Tesla...

Once again, Reddit proves that it loves to suck Elon's dick."
Yes...that is true and the way the media covers Tesla is crazy making! 42k miles and 98&#37; on AP and my car has saved my butt on countless occasions. 
It is silly that Tesla receives so much news coverage over accidents when people die EVERY DAY in car accidents. It’s just because they are a relatively new and innovative company. 
Drivings one of them best things about life

"Musk is deflecting.

Yes, the driver was 100&#37; in the wrong but that's not the question. How could not breaking in this situation be anything other than a serious defect?

From TFA,

\> South Jordan police said the Tesla Model S sedan was going 60 miles per hour when it slammed into the back of a fire truck that was stopped at a red light. The car appeared not to brake before impact, police said."
The whole point of that car is zero emission and fighting global warming... Now some humans set out to defeat a good purpose
He had 2 people burn to death recently.....
The worlds are waivers and experimental technology
"It's amazing that the only sane solution - banning cars - is so out there you might as well suggest we sacrifice 30,000 people a year in a pyre for better public transportation. "
"Back when I was a kid my grandparents had one of the first cars with cruise control which was a Thunderbird. The cruise control would malfunction occasionally and turn itself on and the car would start speeding up to whatever speed it was previously set at. Had that malfunction caused an accident Ford obviously would have taken the blame for it. 

Why does Elon think Tesla is not responsible for a malfunctioning product or feature? 

This fake news attitude coming from Elon is making him and Tesla look bad. 

Take ownership of AP’s flaws Elon and fix it. "
AP does not replace the need for an alert driver behind the wheel. I think it's ridiculous that the media is suggesting that it's an AP issue and not the responsibility of the driver. AP should be renamed to Driver Assistance to stop giving the main stream the wrong expectations. 
"i mean, 40k per the 250,000,000 cars vs 1 injury of the 250,000 teslas puts it in perspective"
This is the first I heard of it.
"Wait the U.S has 40,000 deaths from car crashes?
Holy shit, our country hits about 250 a year and our government loses their shit."
"It's all about expectation. People *expect* folks to die horribly in car accidents. Unfortunately, they also expect technology to be completely safe and without fault. We're a confusing ignorant bunch."
"Progress can often be measured by people doing dangerous shit. How many boats never made the Atlantic crossing to settle in America?

Respect to those folks beta testing autopilot on the road for us. They're pioneers."
"People keep thinking self driving cars are going to completely eliminate road accidents. 0 deaths and injuries is unrealistic yet every one is completely media blitzed because it’s new.

People need to understand that the systems will never be perfect and people will still get injured and die with self driving cars. It’s inevitable.

But if that number can be minimized so severely that each one makes the news then that will be real news indeed."
"Oh I guess, makes sense now"
"Make your vehicles available for dealer sales in America. You won’t get so much flac Elon.

Love what you’re doing but it WILL hurt a lot of American jobs .

And I’m all for tech and progress. Just give dealer options."
qq
Same with the occasional battery fire.  Somehow a couple of those a year is reason to go apeshit insane.  But the thousands of gas fires a yeah is all meh.  
See also: what is news?
I agree we should Cover GM more. They've taken a lions share of our tax dollars as well. 
"My classmates funeral was today.  He was in his 30s with a great life and family.  He was killed by a box truck that crossed over and hit his car head-on.  The truck driver was likely inattentive. 
 It is one of many such accidents that likely wouldn't happen with good autonomous vehicles.  I'm sad that we haven't yet made it."
"Well that's because a Tesla crash is notable and rarely happens. Thus it's news. A regular fatal car crash happens all the time, thus is not newsworthy. "
"Tesla only has like 12 ^1/2 cars on the road, though."
Well put
It’s called “capitalism” 
But what about Ghaza?
What do you mean no coverage? Every single night the local news covers a car crash. They’re just so common to see you tune them out. 
What channel do those motor companies advertise with?
Sounds like you're describing Trump's presidency
Is it though?
I'm sure when the other major companies catch up when their self driving cars cause injuries. You'll see them in the news too.
Kind of like mass shootings
It’s hard to be a pioneer as ppl want to see you fail cuz if you succeed it proves them wrong in their ways 
Not sure what you mean. There's a constant flow of fatality accident stories in local news. It's just white noise. Nobody listens to it anymore unless it's someone they know.
Hmm what could the difference be? 
"Stop crying damn, Tesla has one accident and you want to burn it to the ground. Other car compannies have thousands each day..."
Welp looks like I'm not going to be buying a Tesla
"Make it 10,000 so it will not be reported as news next time"
Media (fueled by entertainment and ppl psychology that bad news is more interesting than good news) has always been like this unfortunately.
"""Not my elony wonny!"""
"Wow bro, like I never even sat down to like ponder this rad dudes post. Dude got moded. "
"It’s just sensationalism and clickbait. There was a story about how some high schooler died in a Tesla crash along with his friends. They made the title sound like the Tesla was to blame but in the actual report, the kids took a dangerous turn going 60 when the speed limit was 35 and locals even said taking that turn at 35 was scary. 

The worst part was that, at the very end of the article, they quoted the investigator behind the crash who said the autopilot wasn’t on! There is literally no reason to mention that they were driving a Tesla other than to grab attention. "
"is autopilot more effective than the average responsible (not drinking, distracted, or young and reckless) driver? "
I think it’s because it was on autopilot and an incident like that makes way for the conversation on self driving cars and all that. 
We should ban driving
"People are scared of the unknown and ignorant of new technologies. Most people don’t understand what they are using and playing with everyday. 

Reminds me of the exploding batteries in smartphones, okay, some of them are cheaply made, but another problem is there are chargers that cost much less than others. (There are other problems but I will focus on this on for the storytelling) 
Why would I buy something more expensive, I don’t understand the difference with the “normal” price products.
Then, why should I keep an eye on it while charging? I mean, i can leave it next to my pill of magazines in the living room and go to bed in another room. What wrong could happen?

Then, fire! Then it goes to the news! Big title:
“OMG batteries in lithium are ticking Bombs!!! Hide your kids, hide your wifes!!”

People are not correctly educated about new technologies. It’s disappointing..."
"That is how I felt when I looked at how many people get e. coli in the U.S. every year and Chipotle's stock price and media frenzy over a small handful of cases.

If you don't think there are people out to get these new companies maybe you should consider buying some aluminium and start crafting that tinfoil hat because it's incredible."
"Any press is good press, if it’s for Elon"
It's because reddit admins and other users are shills
A lot of people hate to see others succeed...
Every day I drive by a death toll ticker showing how many people have died in auto accidents this year. Makes you realize how many deaths there are you don't hear about. Daily 
"To be honest all I got from this was ‘yet another dumb fuck on a phone has a crash... oh holy shit that’s not a lot of injury for 60mph into a fire truck!’ 

Autopilot nonsense aside, that’s some mighty fine collision performance right there"
"Few will unfortunately die to fortunately save many. 


I think the most difficult aspect of self driving cars will be the moral dilemma. 


You are driving by yourself, the breaks fail and you are going straight into a wall, impending death. The only way to avoid the wall is to turn into an intersection with a lady pushing a stroller, killing them but saving the driver's life. What is the computer programmed to do??"
"That's because the press are no longer honest arbiters, but have become partisan hacks. "
"Double-edged sword. Tesla also gets a lot of breaks from the public, and the press as well because of the excitement they generate. "
Elon dealing with the fake news. 
Click bait
"Welcome to a world of cynics, they want companies like Tesla to fail.

My dad keeps thinking Tesla is one day away from bankruptcy and that has been his thing for I think the past 2 years"
There had been a slight trend toward being more objective but that has been destroyed by the collection of the various media into a few corporate hands. 
"This is reddit dude. One video of anything could be used to judge an entire race of people culturally, you think this place would give a shit about cars? "

"Thought I would remind you early!  What's your thoughts now?

Zero explanation from Musk and Tesla,  just purped it out!

"
"Wasn't the Tesla to Toyota death numbers after real world adjustments like 3:1 against Tesla?

I'm all for an electric future, but man, Tesla is doing an amazing job at making them selves nearly invincible."
"I agree, what can be done about this?"
I didn't think I would say this about Elon Musk. But I think he is having a meltdown today...
"I'm sorry Elon, but a car with autopilot crashing at 60mph... and to the back of firetruck, is front page news in 2018. Maybe if you didn't promise a FSD car driving cross country by end 2017, then people wouldn't be fixated on that. 

I'm all in with Tesla vision, but my Model 3 will be driven by me for the foreseeable future. I'll let others test AP first. "
So true lmao
"It's ok. The way the news works in America, the more something is reported on the less people care about it."
"Tell me about it.

-NRA"
Maybe they should forget gun control and concentrate on car control lol
"Sorry, but did those 40k accidents happen while an autopilot was active?

Because if not your argument is fucking stupid. "
"""News"" by definition is stuff that rarely happens."
"Putin, the richest man in the world, who bought the US Presidency, owns the majority of oil in his country, and is most likely second to the oil oligarchs from the Middle East. 

Tesla, a tiny company that is looking to upend the oil industry, is going to get shit on by the billions of people who are employed, make money from, profit from, or take bribes from \(Cohen\) the oil industry. I don't think that's confusing at all."
The ridiculous thing is the title makes it sound like autopilot was at fault but in the article they cannot confirm it was engaged. How many other cars get headline news for a fender bender?
"Nah. 

So far, self-driving cars are way behind in deaths per mile driven. 

I wouldn't be surprised if that changes in the future and self-driving cars are proven to be safer but so far they haven't driven enough miles.  

Human drivers have one death per many thousands of miles, many more then self-driving cars one death and just a few thousand miles.  

And now this!

"
"Sensationalized news.

Everyone already knows *people* are idiots, they just really want any excuse to reassure them that it's not their fault for being idiots."
Slams in the back of a truck.... ya fuck all that. It’s getting the attention it deserves 
This means they're doing something right.
Yeah this is ridiculous. The autopilot feature isn't meant to replace the driver yet. I can't tell you how many times my Volco XC90's pilot system didn't brake in time and I had to step in. These systems aren't foolproof yet in any automobile.
"They hit a fuckin firetruck at 60mph. The fact that they're breathing on their own is testament to how safe that car is. I've seen and heard of a hell of a lot worse from a lot less violent accidents and they walk away with a broken ankle. You can break your ankle by stepping off the sidewalk wrong. For that to be the only injury in a vehicle vs firetruck accident at highway speeds is insane. Musk has nothing to defend, his vehicle outperformed damn near every vehicle on the road in terms of safety in this incident. "
Wow that's totally super messed up bro
"That's because he promised cars for the masses but instead built the opposite.

Chancer!"
"This is what irked me about the article...

Title:

> Tesla with **Autopilot** slams into truck stopped at red light

First paragraph:

> A Tesla sedan with a semi-autonomous Autopilot feature has rear-ended a fire department truck at 60 mph (97 kph) apparently without braking before impact, **but police say it’s unknown if the Autopilot feature was engaged.**

Is it me or do they just want to include Autopilot for the sake of views? Really shitty journalism (unless I missed something)."
I bet their ankle broke broke because the pedal didn’t.   
The Washington Post seems to have a bit of a vendetta against Elon and Tesla and SpaceX. Weird. 
"The one that gets criticised and critically judged the most, is generally someone or something that's the best of the best. 

With some minor exceptions of course. "
"So I see Elon's point, and I see the counterpoints, and I see everyone argue about how maybe Autopilot doesn't make driving *more* safe... but can anyone tell me how it makes it *less* safe? I'm an admittedly huge Tesla fan, so I just don't get what point the other side is trying to make."
Super. 
Welcome to corporate mass media
I really hope Tesla can bounce back after this!
don't forget the 4000 that died at 9/11
Pffftttt... Try being a legal gun owner with a gun who didn't shoot anyone of the 8k murders over the past year with 300 million guns in the US
"In motorcycling there is a truism that it's not the first 1000 miles that are the most dangerous, but the second 1000.  During the first 1000 you are on high alert, and think you are careful and extra cautious.  But in reality, there were a ton of close calls - that never registered as such and you got away with them.  Each of those close calls normalized into ""good"" riding - leading you to overestimate your ability and often leading to the near or not so near miss that truly sets your understanding of what your abilities are.

I think we are seeing a similar thing with AP - owners are getting away with close calls without realizing it...until a situation crops up that they did not get away with.  This could easily have been another Tesla fatality in the news - making it four in a little over a month.  Four is NOTHING compared to other makes, but Tesla unfortunately has to deal with its current level of scrutiny as the ""cool new thing""."
"it literally says at the very start police dont know if auto pilot was engaged, and she was on her phone.  i feel like maybe some bullshit is afoot?"
Absolutely no room for error when companies want to put AI driverless cars on the road that could raise the death tool.
#marchforlife ? 
"I forget what news outlet but the reporter said something across the lines of ""Elon said what's really incredible is the speed of 60mph would have killed someone but in this case only breaking an ankle."" ""But we don't hear about those other crashes do we"" and I was thinking no shit because loads happen everyday and it's a fact of life dipshit

Edit: Stay Tuned on Snapchat"
Wouldn’t it be slander though? I’m pretty sure if these news companies are lying and hurting the sales of Tesla then they can be fined or something.
"The Tesla Model S earned a 5-star safety rating, both overall and in each individual category, from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). ... Around 1 percent of cars tested by the NHTSA earn five stars in every category.

I’d take a broken ankle"
I see your point but I disagree. Please let me explain. The thousands of people who die each year due to human error and negligence are statistic points in an old news story. It’s something we are accustomed to and the average driver takes the risks for granted. Driverless cars will be the future of transit and any and everything that happens bad will be covered in the news because it is new and exciting. It doesn’t make the lives of the victims of normal crashes less valuable. In a way it will honor the victims because the human race will eventually have a statistically better chance of survival in a common road trip. The broken ankle is one of many growing pains that will eventually become one of the greatest innovations of our species that will save countless lives.

"It must be said, and Elon should be saying it every chance he gets - the “autopilot” is not an autonomous self driving car. If it were it would not be road legal in 99.9% of the country. It is a driver’s assist program, arguably the best one on the market. The driver should be driving with his hands on the wheel and foot near the pedals at all times while the car helps him out in amazing ways. But if people continue to use it like a fully realized self driving car of the future, accidents will continue to happen and that is not good for Tesla, for the industry, or for the people on the roads.

The video you're referencing is their FSD system which isn't out yet and won't be for years. Autopilot is a different software package.
"Yeah, people are dumb and make mistakes all the time. However very few make the ""goes full speed at 60 mph into a stationary object without trying to avoid it or stop"" kind of mistakes. It's a big deal if a ""self driving car"" can't avoid large stationary objects at high speed."
"I'm in agreement, but wouldn't a good rule of thumb with a Tesla be to... I don't know, keep your hands on the steering wheel and one foot ready to brake?

You have something that practically can drive itself in a lot of circumstances. I thought a big part of owning a Tesla was knowing you were helping to train the system and seeing it improve over time.

So we've gone from videos posted frequently of Teslas driving themselves - with incredibly aware drivers behind the wheel - to now people thinking the car can just drive itself anywhere?

It honestly sounds like Teslas have improved quite a bit if people are getting away with that shit, but I hope the accidents will make them stop."

"Yes! Large, very expensive, late model luxury cars are already much safer than the average across all cars on the road.

I bet you that in some conditions, Teslas are satistically less safe because of the autopilot.  That is probably why they will not release any raw data or even have the nhtsa do a study. "
"The stat the above is pointing out is: Musk is comparing Tesla with all types of vehicles for ""40,000""

The figure for 2016 passenger car deaths seems to be ~13,000 (1440228/100x0.9)

The passenger car rate given is for 2015: 0.9 deaths per 100m miles traveled, which is one death per 111m miles. This is ~29% worst than Tesla."
"While I agree the timelines are somewhat unrealistic, it’s important to keep in mind that estimating the future state of something that hasn’t actually been done before is not exactly something one should expect accurate timelines for.

They might have a huge breakthrough tomorrow, or they might hit an issue with the entire architectural approach that requires significant redesign work (and subsequent re-learning). This stuff is damn near impossible to predict accurately both on an engineering and management level, and the nature of the problem means just adding more resources is unlikely to help progress.

So we’d likely end up with equally inaccurate estimates on the other end if they went with more “realistic” timelines, at no benefit other than giving the team less to stretch after since they have “plenty of time”"
Except this isn't a self-driving car. It has a driving assistant that should not have been turned on in this situation.
"> for free.

You don't get paid? That's your fault for accepting that."
"Yeah and death rates for some higher end vehicles are crazy lower. The Audi A6 which is arguably a legitimate ICE Model S competitor has a 0 driver fatality rate. I don't know how Musk can go around claiming that his car is the safest when the real world data shows several other vehicles doing significantly better.

I don't think anybody should be afraid of driving a Model S, it's clearly still a very safe car but it's very hard to argue that it's legitimately the safest. It doesn't even do all that well in small overlap testing so in crash tests it's already not the best, and in the real world the stats very clearly favor other cars."

If all cars were on 'autopilot', or similar tech from other compaies, and the total amount of ppl killed went down to 20.000 it would still be a win imho. But as of now, I have not seen any hard science on what tech like autopolit does with the total safety-image of the car. I presume it makes the car safer, but I dont know.

As Elon said, it shouldn't be news that a Tesla crashed but that the driver only broke an ankle.

Until all cars have sensors and legislation passes AP won’t be viable.

"> According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles.

There are big problems with focusing on that statistic, though.  For instance, the demographics of people who drive Teslas isn't equivalent to the demographics of drivers as a whole.

According to [this page](https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/teen_drivers/teendrivers_factsheet.html), 

>per mile driven, teen drivers ages 16 to 19 are nearly three times more likely than drivers aged 20 and older to be in a fatal crash.

I don't see a whole lot of teen drivers behind the wheel of $80k+ luxury cars.  That alone would make a significant difference in the numbers."
It would be better if he was able to compare it to different car brands at the same price point instead of using the average for every single car on the road
I hope the driver is prosecuted. The was 100% her negligent behavior.   
"> Tesla was every 320M miles. It’s not possible to be zero

im sure if you tried hard enough you could get a fatality every 0 miles"
"> Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective

That's BS.  The majority of these cases involve people looking down at their phones, which is easily detectable.

You can't prove that someone staring out the window is paying attention but the major distraction is the bulk of these cases is going to be in the person's lap and to the car's interior vision system, their eyelids will appear to be almost closed."
Does anyone else smell desperation here?
It's not surprising WSJ reports false information. They're like Republicans. They hear something that sounds like a story that will sell a lot of papers and run with it while not fact checking.

On the one hand, sure, idiot.

On the other hand, *fancy cruise control* seems like it would be *really* hard to use properly. You have to basically do nothing but keep your hands on the wheel (but not use it!) ready to take over at a moment's notice.

People don't function well like this. I mean, if you can remember, what were the shittiest jobs to have early in adulthood? The ones that had *fuck-all* to do for *hours on end*, but would fire you in a heartbeat if they caught you, say, watching something on a nearby television for a minute. I mean, short of the army, people don't take those kinds of jobs, where you're basically stuck alone with your thoughts, unless they're all they can get.

I don't plan on ever using autopilot. In all honesty, I don't plan on spending a single dime on that stuff until full self-driving is available."
"The problem with autopilot is that it encourages distracted driving. You shouldn't have an automated driving system unless it's more effective than active driving. You are deliberately making a system that allows people to not be actively engaged in driving while putting all liability on them to act as if they are the active driver. It's a deliberate way to have humans test their AI driving software and have all faults placed on the humans in the vehicles.
It's a real problem and it's harming us."

"There’s no red lights on freeways. You’re thinking of the March accident, I believe. "
"As someone who has broken a knee (not an ankle, but same appendage at least) I’d dare say you’re correct on that assumption haha "
That is the speed limit for that road 55-60mph.
Where are you seeing that? Every source I’ve seen says no braking occurred. 
Hey thanks! I’m excited to play around with it once it gets here. (In... 6 months or so?) 
"> It's fair and morally desirable to point out if the press coverage is creating a false impression of safety, 

Indeed, in a perfect world there wouldn't be any false impressions and articles wouldn't be written just for clicks.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world.

It's just a little hard to to take that complaint seriously when it only ever seems to come up when the coverage isn't overwhelmingly positive.  I didn't hear calls to point out if the press coverage is creating a false impression of safety when Tesla was touting their [""5.4 stars"" claim](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1086352_tesla-models-s-gets-highest-safety-test-score-ever-awarded-by-nhtsa) that the NHTSA themselves ended up disputing.  That made front page news as well.

Put another way: I think it's super messed up that Elon gets front page news for using [misleading statistics](https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/996102919811350528) to push a false narrative about his cars being the safest cars on the road while other automakers get no coverage for having similar or even lower fatality rates.

Live by the sword, die by the sword."
I think your last concern should be the news bias in this subject in a long line of other issues which are much more detrimental to people's safety and existence. Specially America. 
"There is the expression *any publicity is good publicity*.

People who wouldn't know about EVs or Tesla normally, learn about how there are many Tesla EVs on the road, which can hit a firetruck at 60, and only get a broken ankle, and have bleeding edge AP tech."
"Whataboutism: a British invention to deflect from the fact their empire killed more people than any other in history, barring *maybe* the Mongols.  "
">But when it comes to the big national boys its more like 5% vs 95%. 

That's nowhere near true.  Tesla gets positive front page coverage all the time.  From their ridiculous ""5.4 star safety"" claim to ""roof so strong it broke the machine"" to ""breaks Consumer Reports rating scale"" to the endless string of ""full self-driving"" articles.  Hell, just look at the Model 3 making front page news for being unveiled.

And a ton of that coverage was misleading or outright inaccurate, whereas the worst thing you can say about most of the recent news is it doesn't look good for Tesla."
"Tesla's autopilot page has a video showing full self driving. Many people interpret this and other marketing to indicate the car is capable of more than it is.

Currently autopilot does not [detect static objects](https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-autopilot-why-crash-radar/)."
"Autopilot is a driver assistance system, not a full self-driving autonomous system. That means the driver cannot take their eye off the road or hands off the steering wheel.

The name implies that you can press a button and let the vehicle take you to your destination, and while that is sometimes possible and is the goal, it is not perfect and can lead to accidents as seen in the OP."
"Elon and Tesla need to rebrand their **Driver Assistance Software** as something other than ""Autopilot"" and ""self-driving.""

The world is too far gone to be so careless with words. Any moron walking into a Tesla distributor or hearing a Tesla commercial about ""Autopilot"" will take the word at face value. They will also not research their own car or read the manual, as anyone, even owning base model 97 Ford explorer, should do.

Obviously I'm being general. The Tesla subreddit is a wealth of info, even things not advertised. Also I'm sure there are individuals who are frothing at the mouth for more info on the Teslas."
"I agree with OP and here is my take: Tesla Autopilot sounds like a plane autopilot, that's known to be very effective and requires little to no human intervention when flying. Drivers think Tesla Autopilot will do the same: drive them safely to destination, which clearly isn't the case. It should rather be renamed to something like ""driver assist"", implying that it will assist you with driving, and not the other way around."
"autopilot makes it sound like it is essentially an automated chauffeur that can drive you from A to B without issue when in reality it requires constant monitoring. So there are two things that are happening in tandem, people are being stupid, and the terminology is misleading. So you have two groups who tend to argue past each other, one side saying 'its misleading' and the other side saying 'the person was an idiot' when both sides are pretty correct.

Opinion: On the other hand, though i agree the terminology is misleading, I don't think its the fundamental issue here. I doubt that calling it 'hands on wheel always its just cruise control with extra bells mode' would actually change things for the same reason that it usually isn't people doing this stuff during their first ever drive. They try it out a few times and form an impression about how well it functions when no problems occur and then get surprised when a problem actually occurs. This is a fundamental cognitive bias humans have in general (planning fallacy) and isn't something that is likely to be fixed easily or cheaply. So yeah I think the name should be changed for accuracy, but i don't think its going to save any lives and since it won't do that, the bad publicity won't go away."
"Yeah I wish we had less handicaps. It seems like there are more accidents now than in the 90s. I literally pass at least 1 accident a day and I dont even have to commute that far anymore.

Would not having power steering cause more accidents, or make people drive less carelessly and reduce them?"
Is what it should be called. 
No. And that's a pretty awful mistake.

"... No, not whenever. "
"""Autopilot"" is a flashy name that catches attention. Media knows this. If it was called ""deluxe cruise control"" it would not be as salacious.

Frankly I think Tesla should back off the self driving claims and rename the autopilot so they are less of a target. 

As the other comment states, if you live by the media sword you die by it too. I don't see complaints about media articles covering self driving theories and plans. When the future amazing robot car crashes, sorry but that's news. Don't like it? Tweak how your product is sold and marketed. "
"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=washington+post+car+accident+articles&t=hb&ia=web
"
Nuance? In the media? Naaaaah
It's not a self-driving car and no one has claimed that.
So you want a perfect system? Or just engineers not telling the truth?
It should stop for vehicles in front of it that are not moving. What does the red light have to do with this?
Did you mean to respond to a different comment?
I think the demographics are a bit different for people who buy the car so you can't really directly compare.
Trumpisms? LOL. You clearly don't follow Trump.
"All passenger cars isn't the relevant comparison. What about luxury vehicles manufactured from 2012-present? That's when the Model S launched.

I don't have a motive here, but Musk's stat is misleading."
">While I agree the timelines are somewhat unrealistic, it’s important to keep in mind that estimating the future state of something that hasn’t actually been done before is not exactly something one should expect accurate timelines for.

That certainly hasn't stopped Tesla from charging extra for this nonexistent feature now has it!

Saying aaaany day now when it's probably at least 10 years away is a lot more than ""somewhat unrealistic"".  I believe there is a class action lawsuit related to this."
"Ahh, he's protecting his PR, Okay well I guess that's expected.
"
">\~40,000 ***people who died*** in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage 

The thing Elon was crying about is not a real thing. What is hard to get here?"
"Yes she shares responsibility, and in many ways might be 100% liable.

It still bothers me though that so many are willing to rush to the defense of this company which, at the end of the day, is there to sell a product.  If the brakes were supposed to apply automatically (a feature found outside of tesla) and did not (and to be fair the article cites witnesses and isn't certain if the autopilot was on), then that is 100% something that is not ok, and the marketing is heavily aimed towards making people think the cars are self driving (and has been toned back since the accidents both with their own and other automated cars).

Further [""Car's about as dangerous as last year""](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812542) obviously won't make news. This reeks of deflecting and yet makes the front page. You won't, and shouldn't, see anyone defending another car maker like this, and it worries me to see this sort of response."
They could also have added eye tracking like other companies to ensure people aren't making the mistake of thinking it's more autonomous than it is.  Musk does seem to have a very cavalier attitude to this
"Free market Capitalism would let Tesla fail instead of propping them up with tax payer subsidies (aka corporate welfare).

Nice try though, kiddo."
"This isn't exactly a new opinion lol

edit: I appreciate the immediate downvote"
"False advertising, massive employee turnover, production delays and labor law violations don’t do much to help them. I think Elon is very far removed from the reality of how his “showrooms” operate. Ever seen a bunch of people in their early 20s pretending they don’t want to shoot up a mall? Then go visit a Tesla showroom. "
"> I know what sub I'm in but aren't you worried about their financials?

What in their financials should I be worried about? I've yet to see anything of concern."
OP probably got used to it and adjusted his/her driving. 
"Yes he did.

"It's modded then, you have to have at least one hand on the wheel or it won't let you use auto pilot."
...Yes.
"Google it yourself. Tesla related deaths, Tesla vehicles on the road compared to Toyota deaths, Toyota vehicles on the road, divide teslas vehicles by Toyotas and multiply Tesla deaths. Its 3x more when adjusted for equal popularity."
"Don't you think the media hops on it because of all the hype that Musk and the Tesla community creates? How many times have you heard Tesla people talk about the car driving itself? 

Tesla claims

>All Tesla vehicles produced in our factory, including Model 3, have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver.

There's a $4,000 option that requires a $6,000 option that claims full self driving ability in the future. 

This is why people are interested in Tesla crashes. They make wild claims and people are interested in the progress. 

>There are many cases where Teslas save lives thanks to their nature as EVs (no combustion engine in front of the cabin) and safety standards in general but these barely ever make it to the news.

Elon Musk likes to hype up the safety of Tesla's, and while they are excellent. They are not the safest cars. He's also very misleading, for example when he showed the image of the Tesla's side impact test compared to a Volvo. He tried to show how much damage the Volvo took. It turns out the Volvo is designed to slide the seats inwards and deform the car's body instead of people. The Tesla cannot do this because of it's batteries. The Tesla is ranked lower a result. "
"I'm with Elon on calling out the bullshit though

Press cannot be given free reign to type whatever they want and release it as truth"
"Guns are controlled too then.  You need to be a minimum age, pass a background check, and receive and maintain a license to carry them."
"yeah the name is definitely slightly misleading to the general public, but I don't know one Tesla owner that actually thinks their vehicle can drive completely autonomously... I guess I just don't know any idiots.

I just don't understand how anyone can buy a car like this and not even bother to learn the inside and outs of the features, the software and hardware. I feel like the people crashing these cars in ""autopilot"" would probably get in an accident with literally any car they drive."
His vision is not the used Car market. The first car Tesla brought out was not for the masses. 
"Turns out he's talking about the title wording, not whether autopilot was on"
"It’s true. All those anti-Tesla trolls certainly bring an unthinking, offensive tone to the place."
I agree. But we should also consider how far we've come with all this Technological discoveries.

"Yes, but wasn'T the problem also that the person letting the AV drive because he/she misunderstood that it isn't intended to drive? This opens up a discussion about TESLAs job of educating it's drivers."
"You can't get an autonomous vehicle from Tesla, which seems to be part of the problem in that people think Tesla sells autonomous vehicles to the public. Admittedly it does really confuse the matter since Tesla sells FSD, but you can't actually activate FSD if you buy it so all the Teslas on the road are semi-autonomous."
"Safety is a surprisingly difficult thing to measure. Crash survivability might be higher on an heavier car, but your decreased braking distance means that a smaller, lighter car would have been better at accident avoidance. 

My hunch is that Teslas get drive more aggressively than the average car due to their capabilities, but this is probably offset somewhat by safety features. Just based on reading the forums, though, there appear to be more, younger Tesla drivers than I would have expected given the cost. "
Didnt teenage drivers just die in a Tesla in Florida?
Do you know if these sort of stats are available for other luxury vehicles around the same price range? Could potentially get closer sample populations to do a proper comparison.
"> That alone would make a significant difference in the numbers.

Teen females are just below 2x more likely to be in a fatal crash.  Teen males around 8x.  Also,  if they're in Texas,  their likelihood increases around 18% compared to California.

There's a lot of depth to these numbers that often gets ignored.
"
Rich people let their teenage children drive nice cars all the time.
Yeah maybe compare the crash statistics of cars in a similar price range to account for age/socioeconomic background? 
"That's a good point. I would also point out that [the average age of a vehicle on the road is 11.5 years old](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/07/29/new-car-sales-soaring-but-cars-getting-older-too/30821191/). Given the age of the company and its sales growth rate, I would suspect that the average Tesla is probably only a few years old.

That means that Elon is comparing relatively new Teslas with modern safety features and fewer time to develop mechanical issues to vehicles whose safety features are a decade out of date and have had time to develop various mechanical issues that can cause more severe accidents."
">	I don't see a whole lot of teen drivers behind the wheel of $80k+ luxury cars. That alone would make a significant difference in the numbers.

Come to North Dallas, the place where rich mommy and daddy put their little sunshine in cars that cost more than every car I’ve ever owned combined."
"> teen drivers ages 16 to 19 are nearly three times more likely than drivers aged 20 and older to be in a fatal crash.

Let's be generous and say that 16-21 are 3 times as likely. 

Assuming safe driving extends until 70 years old.  That's still only 9% of the drivers on the road.   So if we weight 9% of Tesla drivers to have triple their contribution then that's only an 18% increase in fatalities not a 400% increase.  That's a pretty minor change. "
"This is all fine and dandy, but people want to know what this means for *them* and I can personally say that before owning a Tesla, I had a fatal crash once every 86k miles, but since I bought my Model S and had LASIK, I haven’t had a fatal crash in years. "
I'd like to invite you to Vancouver. 
"See, this is why I like this sub. We're all Tesla fans, but the average Redditor here is still critical of any claims made by even Elon himself. "
"Hah, I was going along with this thinking he really aced those hard questions until this. Now it just seems misleading."
"Lol, who the hell lets children drive anyway? Drivers licenses should be 21+ strict. "
"Even if you adjust it to include only adults out of that age range, the Tesla still has a wide margin. Not quite the 4x stat originally quoted, but significant nontheless."
"Tesla's seem to be really good at surviving a horrible accident when they happen, but Musk is constantly twisting driving stats to fit his story."
"That’s true, and the experience comes into play as well. Someone who can afford a Tesla has a lot more experience driving. "
"Tesla actually has apples to apples comparison data. 

All they have to do is look at pre-autopilot Model S and compare to post autopilot Model S.

I recall them citing the improvement at some point back in the autopilot v1 days. Think it was roughly a 2x improvement at the time. 

Autopilot has improved a lot since then, would be interesting to see a similar comparison today. "
"Yep, you’d have to be incapable of all critical thinking to not pick this out. I’ll drive myself, thank you very much Elon."
Do you have to be 16 to drive in an SA?
If you have a better measure I would love to hear it.
Tons of teens with teslas here in norway where tesla is a reasonably cheap car. 
"Even if you were to over compensate and cut Teslas miles per fatality to a third, it is still ~25% safer than other vehicles."
You need to stop making valid and reasonable points you are ruining the internet
yeah but you also see eldelry people behind a 80k+ car
"Good point, but is there even a way to measure it more accurately than that? Also, I don’t know the exact number but somehow I doubt 25% of the driving population is 16-19."
Compare the Teslas to other similar old and priced cars. You‘ll be surprised 
"You are correct about the part with teens, but I believe one of the deaths was a teen driver.  Also the Model S then went airborne was also a teen.  "
"At least some of the Tesla crashes are from young people borrowing the car. The one in Germany where the car flew, was a 19 year old, as I remember."
So teenagers driving a Tesla are more safe then an adult in a Honda?
"I think Musk refers to Autopilot fatalities for every 320M miles, which makes this argument valid still."
You can mash statistics as much as you like. It would probably be the same stat if you compared it to similarly priced cars. Or to similar demographic. If you compare as a whole it actually helps their case more as it means more will want the same safety features driving them into greater spread of cars. Like seatbelts were.
"> There are big problems with focusing on that statistic, though. For instance, the demographics of people who drive Teslas isn't equivalent to the demographics of drivers as a whole.

Or that number includes fatalities of motorcycle riders. "
You’ve clearly not been to Norway.
"Also Teslas are safer by themselves even without autopilot, so they should compare Teslas with and without autopilot (which they have)"
"Elon yet again throwing out false stats. Those quarterly AP stats tesla is gonna be releasing is gonna be the most biased un-contextual manipulated twisted report ever.

Anyone with common sense will tell you the vast majority of cars out there are 10-15 years old. Making them less safe right off the bat. To actually get a good statistics you have to compare the same demographic and the same tier (luxury) of cars. For example, the latest Audi, Mercedes and BMW, Volvo etc.

You can't compare the safety record of a 2017 Tesla to a 2002 honda accord. Yet that's what Elon wants you to believe and people are lapping it up"
"> There are big problems with focusing on that statistic, though. For instance, the demographics of people who drive Teslas isn't equivalent to the demographics of drivers as a whole.

Not true at all. Being rich doesn't make you a better driver.  In fact, I would argue affluent people will be more vapid than the average driver.  Much less life lessons learned by these people.

This crash has always been a problem with auto pilot or tesla's in general.  They have the capability to break before hitting a stopped car, but the feature isn't in the car.  People have no idea if the car will brake or not.  People expecting it to brake do rear end other cars and learn the hard way that it won't.

Same goes for when people hit the gas instead of the brake and hit buildings.  The tesla has the hardware to deal with that, but its not a feature.

This is why when it comes to any kind of emergency breaking, other cars with simpler systems are better.  Its something tesla really needs to work on."
"This is the kind of thing that bothers me about pure statistics.  “Demographics of people who drive Tesla’s......”. 

So how should Elon and Tesla report their data? Do you expect them to adjust their numbers to account for demographics? Do you think any other agency or car manufacturer is doing that? No. "
There isn't asany Tesla . So the data is scewed
They are still crashing into them at comparable rates.
"The fact that teen drivers are much more likely to be in a fatal crash reinforces the affortability aspect. If more companies would push self-driving vehicles like solar power has been pushed, we would see affordable vehicles hitting the roads much more quickly."
Well said. Teslas are safer than average but are a biased sample. We need to compare Tesla accident rates against data matched either for driver age and socio-economic status or vehicle age and cost/category.  
"I don’t think the age would matter in a Tesla.. I think they’re measuring the autopilot vs human ability. So whether you’re 18 freshly licensed or 45yo professional race car driver, the car would drive the same. Correct me if I’m wrong though"
"I don’t think you can back up that opinion.  Plenty of rich people have teenaged children. Student parking lot at UBC is full of maseratis, lamborghinis and Tesla’s. "
"People who have a car that goes 0-60 in 2.5 seconds also probably have a higher fatality rate compared to the average driver. Maybe compare fatalities in Ferraris to fatalities in Teslas, to get a better comparison."
"I don't see the problem. Is the CAR safe? That's the answer addressed and accurately represented by that data. People will be people, they are not cars. Until Teslas can 100% drive unattended, people determine their fate. Crash tests showed the car fared better than most with even the most extreme collisions. So it's a safer car to be wreckless in because it's been tested to see how it handles the worst scenario."
so lets not rely on statistics and just rely on what you see or imagine to be the case. 
Come to Vancouver Canada.  🤔
Come to Vancouver.
What does price have to do with it?
">The majority of these cases involve people looking down at their phones, which is easily detectable.

What about when it's really dark at night, or if someone is wearing dark sunglasses during the day? If eye tracking doesn't work in those situations then it doesn't seem very useful."
"Is it your car's job to tell you to get the fuck off the phone though?

"My question is why did the lady have the max speed set to 60mph on what is apparently city streets? No one here mentions why she was using her auto pilot on a road with controlled intersections either.

Autopilot cars are not equipped to stop at red lights, if there was no car in front of her, she would of blown through the intersection. They tell you this when you buy the car explicitly multiple times as they discuss the feature. This lady was being incredibly negligent and stupid.

Their overall marketing is ambiguous, but they are nothing but clear when they sell you the actual car of what it does, when you should and shouldn't use it, and there are warnings everywhere. 

This is a textbook case of extremely distracted driving, misuse of the autopilot system in multiple ways, and probably a desperate attempt to shift liability. "
"The fact that autonomous driving cars are illegal virtually everywhere should clue a savvy, $80k car buying person into the fact that it is not an autonomous driving car. So should the documentation that comes with the car that specifically states the limitations of the technology and the need for the driver to always be driving. I’m not against it being renamed but I’m not sure it would make any difference. "
"It isn't Tesla's fault that people aren't smart enough to know the definition of autopilot.  They put disclaimers all over it, people just ignore them like they ignore anything else.  You can't fix stupid.  Here is the wiki for autopilot:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopilot"
[This](https://i2.wp.com/elgl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/autopilot.gif)
"Help the pilot fly in long straight lines with nothing within miles in any direction.

Just like its easy to drive a car in straight line with nothing around for miles.

Autopilot is not used for take off and landing.  You know, the part where there are other things closer than several miles away."
"Yeah, this transition period with semi-automated vehicles almost seems designed for people to be even more distracted while driving and overall make them worse drivers. I think we'd all like to think we'd all be perfectly attentive drivers ourselves while in autopilot mode but I bet the majority of us would not be able to resist the temptation to at least occasionally get temporarily distracted. Texting while driving is already a massive problem and this just enables it even more. "

"I recently purchased a Pacifica that has adaptive cruise control and lane departure (ontop of front collision avoidance). What that means is on a recent 300 mile drive there were 30+ minute stretches where I didnt touch the gas or brake, and probably could done the same with the steering wheel to an extent (it could drive straight stretches by itself, not turns).  

But I kept ready at any point to hit the gas or brakes.  Honestly, the adaptive cruise control probably drives safer than 99% of drivers.  You can set different lengths at which it matches the car's speed that is front of you, and slows down gradually before it gets to that gap anyways.  

Basically, even in the primitive state it's much safer than a normal driver. But it's got to be treated with the understanding that you're actually still the active driver and not fuck around. "
"Yeah, I read some articles and papers that are pretty clear that autopilots have to be either gentle assistants or absolutely trustworthy, othewise its a receipt for catastrophy.

Basically, autopilot as of now INVERTS the sensible curve of automation: The driver doesn't have to do the easy parts, but must be ready at a moments notice to avoid catastrophic failure.

Thats exactly the opposite of ""fail safe"" driving assistance like stability control or autobrake which leave the easy parts to the driver and are ready to intervene if something extraordinary happens."
What the fuck is the point of the fancy cruise control then?
"I mean I've used it quite a bit when I went on like a month long road trip and drove thousands of miles and it was great. Just pay fucking attention to the road. It's not a completely foolproof system, I had to override it a couple times when drivers were straddling lanes."
"I mean solution(For now) is pretty simple.

Put down the fucking phone if you're driving. 

""Autopilot"" or not the phone can wait. 


Bored? Audiobooks(I am not sponsored by audible), music, radio, ect. 

There is no reason to pick up the phone while you're moving in a vehical."
"Yeah, it looks to me like the value here is the car's build that helps it result in lower injury when a crash occurs. The auto\-pilot is a black mark of danger on an otherwise safer car, as far as I can tell."
"> On the other hand, fancy cruise control seems like it would be really hard to use properly. You have to basically do nothing but keep your hands on the wheel (but not use it!) ready to take over at a moment's notice. People don't function well like this. 

You hit the nail on the head. That's the worst thing that humans are at: staying alert while doing mundane tasks.

It's convenient for a company to boast about how advanced the AI technology is, but put 100% of the liability on the driver when something goes wrong."
"Actual experience with Autopilot has shown me that it is really like driving, with less cognitive load. It takes less effort to match and think about speed, and less effort to stay in the lane. That does not mean I then have bandwidth to be a fucking idiot and play on my phone."
">I don't plan on ever using autopilot. In all honesty, I don't plan on spending a single dime on that stuff until full self\-driving is available.

100&#37; this. I like Tesla for being a high\-tech, high\-quality EV, and that's the reason I'd get one. """"""""""Autopilot"""""""""" has 0 interest to me until it completely works"
"I don't agree that people can't function well like that. The point is to take remove tasks from the human brain so they can pay more attention to the road, and be even safer. As for it being boring, you are doing much the same thing as if you were driving, just not moving your feet or hands (on the driving equipment, you can obviously move your hands/feet otherwise). Your eyes however, should be doing much the same as they were before (and should be more effective now with less distractions)."
">You shouldn't have an automated driving system unless it's more effective than active driving. 


The argument being made by Musk and Tesla is that the autopilot *is already* more effective than active driving, as there are fewer deaths per mile using the autopilot than not.

Granted, there are potential flaws in the exact numbers cited in Musk's tweets since the pool of drivers with Teslas (luxury car atm) likely isn't comparable to the average driver. 

But! Humans are really, really, *really* bad at accurately evaluating statistical effects intuitively. We constantly overestimate the danger/risk of something depending on the *predictability* of the danger, not on the chance it actually occurs. This applies directly to self-driving cars: If a human driver crashes 1/100 times,  but it's always attributable to some human mistake they made, that *seems* less scary than a self-driving car crashing 1/1000 times because its crashes might happen to ""good drivers"".


Here's a thought experiment. Say a company comes out with an almost perfect self-driving system and it's insanely cheap to install in any car. The only caveat is that 1 out of every **X** times when you park the car, a gun drops out of the ceiling and shoots the driver in the head.

Now, how big does **X** need to be before:

1.) You'd buy the system? 

2.) There's an ethical obligation to buy the system?

3.) It should be illegal to drive a car WITHOUT the system?

Truly think about this for a moment. If you were told the average driver dies every 1 in 100,000 parks (hypothetical stat), would you be willing to buy the system if **X** = 100,001? Probably not, right? You might want the system to be twice as safe as normal driving, because that gun is just *so* upsetting.

Likely, you'd want **X** to be a million or so before you felt ok with the system, because the *kind* of danger represented by the hypothetical new system is very unsettling to us *despite* being unarguably safer.

So, when discussing self-driving cars we should be aware of our own biases and ask ourselves, ""Is the autopilot safer than normal driving?"" with the hardest numbers we can find in as good a study as possible. Our gut reactions here are incredibly misleading."
"I have a hard time believing auto pilot was even on.

First, if she had the speed set to 60mph on a road with major stoplights, she's an idiot. Second, even Ford's shitty version of adaptive cruise control never failed to slow down as it approach other cars. What would cause it to proceed, uninterrupted, straight into the back of a huge and unmissable object? Musk can't call her out publicly because it might look bad for Tesla to be releasing information against it's drivers, but if this goes to court, I'm sure we'll here about it."
If there are less deaths in a Tesla on average wouldn't you call that effective? People are still stupid regardless of the car they drive.

"> quit cutting lanes

This is actually safer for both the car and motorcycle. Numerous studies have been done that shows that Lane splitting is objectively safer AND better for traffic, and the roadways. Lane Splitting should be legal. It keeps motorcycles out of harms way, it keeps them from taking up space on the road that causes traffic, and people in an environment where lane-splitting is common, drives pay far more attention to motorcycles.

Lane splitting motorcycles is good for you drivers, not bad.

>doing stunts in traffic.

Good point but it's the sportbike dumbasses who do this, and the squids are far less nurmerous and dangerous than Michelle who just got dumped on facebook messenger and cant put the phone down so she runs over a biker.

You can hate the dumb ass sportbike morons all you want, but a 400lb bike is nothing to a 3000lb+ car with a distracted driver in it. 

It only sounds stupid, because you have no idea what the fuck your talking about, and you're making a mountain out of a mole hill where as distracted driving is a serious fucking problem that needs to stop.

Distracted drivers are killing more and more people. IT's a real problem. 

There's a big difference between crotchrocket squidiot biffing his bike and killing himself compared to michelle cantgetthefuckoffthephone who slams into a rider who is following the law, and is killed.

Distracted driving causes more injuries on the road every year than drunk drivers.(Drunk drivers kill more people).

"Auto manufacturers spend billions on advertising.

tesla's plan is that it will have a fleet of tesla taxi's and anyone who owns a telsa can rent there car as taxi.  by 2030, some are estimating 95% of miles driven will be in a taxi.  40% of cars on the road will be personally owned cars that drive around 12,000 miles per.  the other 60% of cars will be driving well over 100,000 miles per year as taxis.  The average person will be saving thousands by giving up owning a car.

All self-driving taxis will be EVs because cannot compete on a per mile basis because of high fuel, maintenance, and repair costs on a per mile basis.

Model 3's already have just about everything needed to be selfdriving today in terms of hardware and that price is 35,000.  the price will not be 35,000 in a decade unless the battery is like 300-500 miles.  

we will need 80% few cars per year.  This disruption is going to occur very fast once it gets started.  Tesla has the best batteries in the world.  some have already last 500,000 miles when they have been used as long distance taxi.  tesloop is a company that offers rides in teslas all over southern california and to vegas.

As a result their credit rating got downgraded (ie: interest rates are going to go up / their debt is going to be a bigger burden). And I'm not sure how easily they can even borrow money right now, how much collateral do they have left to leverage? Elon said they won't need to go back to investors for capital but their quarterly filings indicated they will have to. 

But they can only raise capital if their stock price stays high. If people stop believing in Tesla they won't have a big enough market cap to dilute shares to cover their debts. They'll literally be bankrupt. Wall Street is fairly convinced they're screwed and over 30% of float is shorted right now.

Those articles make no mention of anyone burning to death. However they're both hit pieces that invent facts out of mid-air to make the company look worse than it actually is. The car is crashing WAY less than any comparable cars.
"This is from Tesla's site. Demonstration of autopilot driving around. I've used active cruise control, AEB, lane departure etc etc in Porsche, in SEAT, Benz. I know the limitations but before I researched Tesla, I was under the impression the cars drove themselves. Why? Because that's what they market. The website itself shows it and then it's blamed as user error, and the media is evil for nitpicking on AP when things go wrong. The casual person isn't gonna sit there and find out about AP 1 vs AP2 and know that AP5 is the final stage. They see a Tesla driving itself with Tesla saying the driver is only there for legal reasons but doesn't need to be. "
You shouldn’t make arguments where you flip it on other people to prove you make sense.
"You can't really compare those statistics even if they are accurate.

Tesla's are modern high end luxury vehicles.  Of course they are going to be safer than 10 or 15 year old Toyotas.

So really that's the opposite of normalizing the numbers lol. It's so not accurate.
">Don't you think the media hops on it because of all the hype that Musk and the Tesla community creates? How many times have you heard Tesla people talk about the car driving itself? 

Yes, of course, absolutely! I don't mind Tesla being in the news, I actually like it! But I agree with Elon that the media needs to put everything in a proper context, that's the important point.

It's also correct that the way certain things are written on Tesla's website can be misleading, if you don't read it carefully. I've already seen others complain about the exact same sentence that you quoted and think they should fix it for the sake of integrity.

About safety: I think, when he's referring to Teslas as the safest cars, he's talking about the statistics of fatalities per miles driven, not the crash test results alone.

Rather, look at fatalies by brand and car type on 'per mile basis'. Then, if Teslas Autopilot is to blame, look at data on 'average Tesla AP usage per mile' or something like that. "

"> Teslas get drive more aggressively than the average car due to their capabilities

Can confirm - I came from two Toyota's ( a 4 cylinder and a 6 cylinder minivan) and now I drive a lot more aggressively, because the Tesla just behaves differently. IT's a whole different way of driving. "
Don't agree with that. All Teslas I see on the road drive super safe. Any time you see someone driving like an idiot it's typically a bmw/audi/merc. 
I have to imagine the average Tesla owner is older and more careful than the average driver.

>The agency said on Wednesday its crash rate comparison “did not evaluate whether Autosteer was engaged” and “did not assess the effectiveness of this technology.”
>
>The agency described the Autopilot analysis in the 2017 report as a “cursory comparison” of airbag deployment rates before and after installation of the feature to determine whether models with Autosteer had higher crash rates. Such a finding “could have indicated that further investigation was necessary,” the agency said.

[This article](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/05/sorry-elon-musk-theres-no-clear-evidence-autopilot-saves-lives/) gives a good explanation as to why relying on the simple data provided by the NHTSA doesn't provide enough evidence to make that conclusion."
"The NHTSA actually amde that distinction, saying that Tesla cars equipped with AP hardware are safer overall but that they didn't check for AP use specifically."
"Your right the guy selling cars is selling his cars, but he has a point people driving Teslas are usually safer then they were in their last car."
"I don't know if there's any relation between driving safety and income, but I do know insurance rates are significantly higher for younger drives."
">So how should Elon and Tesla report their data? 

I don't know, but when the NHTSA comes out and says Tesla is making false statements/conclusions based on their data, I think it's safe to say that Tesla is in the wrong."
"Absolutely rely on statistics.  Let's just make sure we use statistics that provide a meaningful comparison.  For instance, statistics that compare the safety of the car rather than the safety of the typical driver."
"This is a weasel response. Are you saying the demographic of Tesla drivers is the same as the average?

There is no data presented on the average age or makeup of Tesla drivers so you have no point about statistics against anecdotal. "
A more expensive car tends to be more advanced when it comes to safety. Death also tends to be something people will pay lots of money to avoid. 
"It depends.  

If there is ""foreseeable misuse"" (engineering safety term) that a human using an inherently unsafe semi-autonomous feature of the care could become bored/distracted and stop monitoring for safe operation, than yes, absolutely.

And in my opinion, this goes way beyond foreseeable misuse.  This is basic human nature.  Musk himself pointed out that most of these accidents occur with people who have experience with the system.  Likely because they begin to over-trust it.  The novelty wears off and they become more likely to disengage from monitoring Autopilot and engage in secondary activities.

Foreseeable misuse is much more subjective.  But if basic human nature leads to hazardous conditions with a product, that product is  unsafe."
"> This is a textbook case of extremely distracted driving, misuse of the autopilot system in multiple ways, and probably a desperate attempt to shift liability.

I don't necessarily disagree... Why Tesla seems to attract this type of person so much though? I'm a huge Tesla fan. It's really annoying."
Tesla's autopilot is garbage. Elon lied when he said you can drive coast to coast on autopilot lol. Their autopilot can't compare to companies like Waymo and Mobileye.

"Tesla drivers are guinea pigs for Elon Musk. They are collecting the data knowing full well that those drivers shouldn't be using autopilot. Does Tesla really expect someone to react fast enough to steer the car in the right direction if the car decides to go off course. They say that in order to take that liability off  themselves. This car should have never crashed into the fire truck. Even if the driver was distracted, the autopilot system should have been good enough to detect a large red fire truck lol. That is the point people seem to miss and Elon is sweeping this under the rug by trying to deflect it will car stats. That is like a pharmaceutical company stating that their drug isn't bad because a lot of people overdose every year."
">Yeah, this transition period with semi-automated vehicles almost seems designed for people to be even more distracted while driving and overall make them worse drivers.

And it's STILL significantly safer than the average driver? I'd call that a win."

"> Pacifica that has adaptive cruise control and lane departure (ontop of front collision avoidance). But I kept ready at any point to hit the gas or brakes. Honestly, the adaptive cruise control probably drives safer than 99% of drivers.

I get this, and that's pretty much what Tesla's autopilot is as well. I bet if Tesla called their autopilot ""adaptive cruise control and lane departure"", then less Tesla driver would be having these types of crashes."
"Do you have a link you could share on this? I was under the impression that the ""less risk"" statistics for the tesla mostly pertained to the car's physical design, not the auto\-pilot feature."
"The problem is that, at this point, the self driving car systems in general are (technically) less safe than regular humans if you count deaths per miles driven. However, there's been so few deaths that it's probsbly not statistically significant but you can't say they are safer yet. "

Tesla/Musk has no problem immediately throwing Tesla drivers under the bus if they have the facts that show the driver is at fault.

The large luxury car (IIHS definition) with the [highest fatality rate over the last survey period](http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/driver-death-rates) is the Hyundai Genesis.  It was half the *new car average*, which is substantially lower than the overall average.  It was also twice the next worst in class.

And even ignoring all that, *neither of those things are evidence of his claim*.  A 5 star rating isn't proof it's the safest car on the road.  A fatality rate that's 4x below average isn't proof it's the safest car on the road.  Neither of those figures mean anything without context, which Elon and Tesla are always careful to avoid.  Why do you think that is?"

The driver claims Autopilot was active. "
"Tesla doesn't actually use LiDAR, and likely never will as a matter of fact.

Currently, there are a few major problems with LiDAR.

* Firstly, it is very expensive - automotive-grade systems can cost [thousands of dollars per unit](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-ouster-lidar-20171211-htmlstory.html) currently. Prices are falling, but as of yet a LiDAR sensor that could be put on a mass-produced car, such as a Tesla, does not exist.

* Secondly, LiDAR [(currently) requires moving parts and is very bulky](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603885/autonomous-cars-lidar-sensors/). This would seriously impact Tesla's goal of making their cars as aerodynamic as possible, which is very important to squeeze every bit of range out of an electric car (this is true for any car, but is most important for EVs which already have a fairly limited range).

* Thirdly and finally, LiDAR performs horribly under conditions that cameras can do just fine in. [Conditions such as fog, snow, or even a light drizzle can seriously damage the ability of LiDAR](https://cleantechnica.com/2016/07/29/tesla-google-disagree-lidar-right/) (certainly, cameras are impacted as well, but to a lesser degree). This is because LiDAR is an active sensor - it shines lasers at something and sees the reflection. If you've ever tried to shine a flashlight through some smoke or fog, you could probably guess why this wouldn't work so well in these conditions.

It's certainly true that companies like Google use LiDAR to power their cars, which is likely due to a combination of having a ton of money to throw around on a few limited test cars that they don't have to worry about selling (if you want to keep a 25% profit margin, a $70,000 LiDAR array would add $87,500, nearly *doubling* the price of a Model S [and repairs could add even more cost!]) and confidence that the technology will improve quickly in the future. These improvements certainly do appear to be happening - [new solid state LiDAR chips are already on the market - for less than a thousand dollars!](https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/solid-state-lidar-for-self-driving-cars/) Even still, there is no solution in sight for LiDAR's weakness to atmospheric obstructions such as rain.

Instead of using LiDAR, Tesla instead relies on cameras as their main sensor. The argument behind this can be summed up fairly simply - humans exclusively use *very* sophisticated cameras to drive (your eyes), and this works pretty well. Not only that, but our entire transportation system is designed to be used with cameras - signs have different shapes depending on what type of sign it is, different colors depending on how serious it is, and nearly everything is in massive font sizes and/or bright orange or yellow. This all adds up to make a nearly ideal situation for cameras to work well.

In short, Tesla doesn't use LiDAR because it has pretty big problems. The most severe problems are its size and cost, both of which eliminate its use on a mass-market car. Instead, Tesla uses cameras for its primary sensors because that's what humans do, and we do it pretty well (most of the time). Tesla, along with other self-driving car companies, uses secondary sensors such as ultrasonics and radar for use in situations where cameras are currently weak."
"Yes Lidar detects solid objects. Teslas do not have a Lidar sensor. Musk doesn't believe it is necessary, he is betting on a camera-based system."
But it does detect solid objects. What it doesn't do is react to stationary objects. That's different. It's the forward radar that maintains your speed. Essentially you don't want it slamming on the brakes if it misinterprets something negligible for a stopped car. Hence why it is only driver assist. You still need to be paying attention. 
"Think about it, if it didn’t detect static objects, then everything that wasn’t moving would be a hazard eg that mailbox or that building you’re passing. IIRC cars are only using radar these days since Lidar is too expensive."
Sonar. Radar uses radio waves. :)
"IMO, they should rename it copilot for now and autopilot once it reaches full autonomy."
"If Tesla is aware, and they have been repeatedly told, that to most people autopilot means a lot more than driver assist then it absolutely is Tesla's fault they keep calling it that.  Referring to technical definitions as a defence is just wilful ignorance of reality"
">	An autopilot is a system used to control the trajectory of an aircraft **without constant ‘hands-on’ control by a human operator being required.**

Tesla markets their system as “autopilot” without meeting the definition of the term. An autopilot system in any modern aircraft **does not require** any input from the pilot to fly literally across an ocean. The pilots can and do other things that don’t require actively flying the aircraft. There are also autoland systems that don’t require any input from the operator to land an aircraft safely. 

What Tesla markets is false, it doesn’t meet the definition of the word, and your link demonstrates that. "

'Autopilot' is considered inferior to GM's 'Super cruise' by pretty much everyone in the industry at the [moment](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-finishes-last-navigant-research-self-driving-tech/). When Uber's self driving car crashed, it was absolutely news and they suspended the program. If there are a bunch of accidents involving Super Cruise, you will see a bunch of articles about that as well."
Tesla doesn't advertise on their platform while the big three are in the top 10 of advertisers on old media.  MSM has a financial obligation to their shareholders to ensure that the major manufacturers are pushed and their competition are snubbed.  
"You asked for “headlines in the WaPo”, I provided some. 

Then you resort to name calling. 

Go away.  "
That was a test of software still in development which has not been deployed to their fleet. No current Teslas are advertised as self-driving.
Are you being intentionally dumb? That's a demo of unreleased software and hardware.
"Can you explain the first part of your comment more? From my understanding, not only does the Tesla maintain a following distance while on cruise control at 1-6 car lengths (depending on what the driver chooses) but it also has accident assist. I think the “at speed” part is confusing me?"
So...what does the red light have to do with anything in this situation? It didn’t run a red light...it slammed into the back of a truck.

Temporarily yes. They have a lot of underutilized assembly line workers and equipment right now. Once they fix production issues (production continues to rise) then it will be profitable.

">About safety: I think, when he's referring to Teslas as the safest cars, he's talking about the statistics of fatalities per miles driven, not the crash test results alone.

That's still wrong and also a weird way to measure because of different demographics.

As mentioned here
https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8jf0lr/elons_response_to_recent_wsj_article_this_is/dyzf1ec/

There are 11 cars that never had a death. 

If you watch the seat in the side impact tests on youtube you can see it move inwards. Volvo calls their system SIPS (side impact protection system) and it currently uses an airbag to help propel the seats away from the impact. The intrusion is not pushing the seats. I can't provide a link specifically crediting this as to why it rates higher in side impact than the Teslas. Considering Volvo's philosophy for side impact is built around the SIPS, it seems fair to credit it though. The system interestingly enough is almost 30 years old now.

Wouldn’t it be slander though? I’m pretty sure if these news companies are lying and hurting the sales of Tesla then they can be fined or something.
Lol
"Never said he did. The model 3 is. But at the beginning his vision was not to build high end priced cars, must of changed his mind. Wonder why. "
I'm not surprised that people always claim autopilot was on; no one wants to take blame. I wonder how long until Tesla has to get into a libel case against people blaming the car for their failures.
So 100% at fault in the eyes of the law.
It would be good if there was a function that actually checks if autopilot was on.

"34.1 m / 112 feet is not bad. 

By way of comparison: 

Some of the best sports cars can achieve 60-0 times of under 100 feet. 
[These 2011 pickup trucks](http://special-reports.pickuptrucks.com/2011/09/30k-shootout-60-0-mph-braking-test.html) were tested between 140 and 150 feet. 

*That means the pickup trucks are stopping 2-3 car lengths slower than the model S.*

Not among Tesla drivers at the moment.
That won't matter.  You just need the sample size to be large enough to be valid and tesla certainly has a large enough base for statistics to be comparable to other cars.

I’m not a Tesla fanboy, I just don’t understand how saying that “fewer people die in Teslas” is a false statement. Of course the more money and education and access to resources you have, generally the safer and longer life you’ll live. 

Does Tesla owe something to the poor? Like they must design and sell a $16,000, safe car?

I am open to having my mind changed, I just don’t get it as stated!"
ohhh ok yeah didn't think about that
"I dont think it's more than any other car maker. If you look at adults in the same age range using other vehicles with somewhat similair features, like Ford's adaptive cruise control, crash avoidance, lane keep, you find that Tesla is still the safer car with less accidents.

As many here have said, nobody reports on Ford's accidents. They see Tesla and they see news story. So you literally never hear about the Taurus that drives straight into another car because the driver was being an idiot with their adaptive cruise control.

I don't like to be a conspiracy theorist, but the large companies have been known in the past to exert unreasonable amounts of soft influence to destroy competitors that might hurt their business model. There may be some of that at play here. "
Yeah I feel like this is where you can tell Tesla is a startup and not a mature car manufacturer. There’s no way in hell Ford or Mercedes would make a mistake that could cost them business and settlement money. 
"It's kinda true though.

No matter the name, people would still notice that they can let the car handle itself 95% of the time. And some ""stupid"" people will then take their hands off the wheel, use their phone, text and not pay attention at all. You will always have these problems."
">	and it does not depend on visual of the runway.

>	Such systems enable airliners to land in weather conditions that would otherwise be dangerous or impossible to operate in.

It’s used in inclement weather in which visibility is reduced. It can and does get used in normal operations, but it really works well to reduce pilot workload and allows fully automated landing in bad weather. Tesla has a serious marketing issue because “Autopilot” **is not** an automatic function.Auto pilot is short for “Automaic pilot” and nothing about Teslas system meets that definition unlike in an aircraft. They need to own up to this false label they’ve given it. It is an *assistant* whereas aircraft system are truly automatic but pilots are monitoring it anyway. The two are different sdeapite Tesla irresponsibly giving their feature an incorrect name. "
"Autoland is a separate system from the autopilot, and it's engaged only after a runway has been selected by the pilot.

It's actually analogous to Tesla's Autopark feature, which you can set up after you find a parking spot.

Pilots rarely use autolanding systems even when they are available. They generally prefer manual landings, probably for the same reason I rarely use Autopark."
They'd also sell fewer cars
"I'm citing the rates of deaths per mile driven, which absolutely could be due to the safety features in general and not the autopilot.

The main point I was trying to make in the comment was that without an actual study of what the driving safety of the autopilot is over large numbers, there's basically no point in looking at any single crash incident and assuming autopilot is unsafe. Our intuition about how 'dangerous' autopilot is is almost guaranteed to be wrong unless the result is *very* obvious, which with a single digit number of deaths is not the case."
">With two deaths to autopilot already

That's not a useful number without the number of miles driven by autopilot.

Is that 2 deaths per 100 miles driven? per 100,000? per 1,000,000? 

Your response is *exactly* what I was talking about. 2 deaths in a vacuum of probability don't state anything about the safety of the feature. 

If doctors developed a cure for cancer that ""killed 2 out of every 1,000 patients"", would we not use that treatment?

There are valid arguments against the autopilot safety measures and how we should be moving forward, but you aren't making them."
"> Tesla/Musk declared as soon as they got the ""blackbox"" data that the driver did not have his hands on the steering wheel.


Yeah, “earlier in the drive”, but not at the time of the accident. The pieces of shit used that wording deliberately to throw doubt into the mix.

"Well, considering this women was using autopilot on a road with traffic lights which it specifically cannot handle, I'm inclined to side with driver error. It's only been one day since the autopilot announcement, it is inevitable that further information will come out. 

Every Tesla owner with autopilot is warned of the limitations. The fact that she may have been using it on a road with numerous traffic lights shows her wanton disregard for her own and others safety. If that firetruck hadn't been there it would have shot straight into the intersection at 60 miles per hour, and she might have killed someone, if not herself.

So either she wasnt using it at all, or she was using it while violating numerous warnings on how it's supposed to be operated.

Media has been propaganda for decades.  Why do you think so called liberal outlets like NBC, ABC, CNN, MSNBC cheerleeded for wars in afghanitan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and other countries.  It is because they get advertising dollars from boeing, GE, Raytheon, and other companies within the military industrial complex.

"Yes that was my question. Based on some other responses it sounds like that doesn't happen if the car is going over 60 mph and it may not work if the other vehicle was never moving to begin with.

TBH, this system sounds like it has a terrible name because it's not autonomous enough to be even remotely considered an ""autopilot"". "
"Yes it is the case with every customer, its not something most energy advisors are necessarily aware of unless they have a good relationship with their install team and ops manager. Tesla was basically just focusing on all retrofits because it’s low hanging fruit. I would think by now it’d be well known but in December there was literally one engineer in the entire company everyone defaulted to for compatibility information. You can easily order Powerwall and the rep may not have been aware or may not have wanted to risk losing the final contract/sale (that’s what the majority of their income is based on) and is crossing fingers it would work out by the time you install. I assume you are implying you have an existing ATS. I highly recommend contacting your sales concierge/support (they’ve changed what they call these people a few times) to create an inquiry. Additionally, you can only have as many powerwalls as your solar system can actually change. I don’t know what size system you’re getting and at this point I can’t even remember what the minimums were because they were constantly changing and communication was very poor between customer facing reps and engineering. The new referral program has 2 tracks, one energy, one vehicle. I believe it was the second vehicle referral reward and the fifth solar referral reward (powerwall/solar roof do not qualify for referral
Rewards—- you can earn up to 5 rewards on each track). When they changed the referral program they removed supercharging for life and solar ambassador so you have to be a customer to benefit.) in the fine print I once read it covers “install” (which they love to advertise) but only to a certain dollar amount (I believe 1 or 2k). 

Also, if you are expecting Panasonic panels MAKE SURE THIS IS IN YOUR FINAL CONTRACT. Tesla advertises these heavily yet they were installing the same old solar city panels and letting energy advisors take the fall. Also, side skirting only recently became available (despite advertising including it for over a year) and if you signed before 2018 and were promised a $500 “pioneer customer discount” (that’s what I called it anyway since $500 is a drop in the bucket) you can only get side skirts OR the $500 credit. 

If you live in an area where there are a lot of squirrels, ask around see if people have had problems with them building nests in their systems and REQUEST SQUIRREL GUARD. also, Tesla will tell you they’re giving you solar edge inverters (top of the line) but when they survey, it you have great exposure, they’ll switch you to the standard, lesser brands including solar city inverters without kicking the savings down to you. 

Additionally, make sure you get your solar installed before or at the same time as powerwall. You’ll still qualify for the ITC if you don’t, but there’s more hoops to jump.

I think that’s everything. I wasn’t comfortable with how Tesla was really treating customers and representing their product personally so I no longer was willing to represent them (never mind all the hours worked for free and other bogus crap). "
Just pointing out that deaths per registered vehicle year is probably not the best way to measure safety. It does not take into account miles driven/time spent on road which could be misleading. Also there was a BMW with a worse rating than the Genesis. 
"You don’t see any difference between a single car crash and a car breaking the machine designed to crush it? Why doesn’t every Toyota Corolla crash make headlines?

You can usually be a much welcomed voice of reason in this sub, but you seem to be being purposefully obtuse right now. "
"With filtering LIDAR can do much better in rain and snow. Ford has demonstrated this 1-2 years ago, and Waymo showed this recently in their presentation at Google IO.

Cost is definitely still an issue with LIDAR (although Waymo claims to have reduced its cost by 90%), but I don't think it's quite as limited in capability as you say it is."
"You forgot to mention that on-board LiDAR also struggles with vibrations in the sensors, and it also creates a metric fuckton of data points that need to then be processed in real time (which requires significant computing power to be on board as well)"
"> Thirdly and finally, LiDAR performs horribly under conditions that cameras can do just fine in.

This may not be right. At Google I/O Waymo just showed ML cleaning up a LiDAR image in the snow."
That doesn't sound good.

Doesn't it *not detect* static objects now?

> then everything that wasn’t moving would be a hazard eg that mailbox or that building you’re passing. IIRC cars are only using radar these days since Lidar is too expensive.

Why would things not on your collision course cause problems? I'd expect it to ignore things at the side of the road but not things I'm about to hit. "
Noted.
You do know that autopilot in planes is not fully autonomous right? 
"Autopilot (the features that are provided under that name) will never reach full autonomy.  Tesla already has a different marketing term for full autonomy which is pretty straight forward, ""Full Self-Driving."""

Autopilots do not do traffic avoidance however. Air traffic (humans) does that for them.

Alright then I guess you are just one of those many privacy-concerned Memphis natives. My bad.
"I think there's a pretty complicated web of reasons, but incentives like that usually do end up mattering. Certainly pissing off Tesla doesn't have any of the negative ramifications that it would for a major advertiser.

That was maybe added after this video. all I'm saying is, Tesla promotes they have a basically self driving car that's super safe and greats crazy high ratings. When it crashes, people are interested because it's new tech and it deserves extra scrutiny. "
It’s not ironic... if you make an opinion based argument and your defense for providing zero truthful foundation is “everyone else do the research” you are useless in a conversation 
"How statistically relevant are demographics in that case? Do they justify the difference to other cars, even if we don't count motorcycle crashs?

That's a link to an article that handpicked a few models among thousands, putting additional specifications on half of them and limiting the time frame. I think there are better sources to argue with. But let's assume for a moment that Teslas aren't the safest cars out there, which isn't unlikely, then wouldn't it still be among the very best models? Let's compare Teslas to cars that are used as much and not handpick statistical anomalies. A few years earlier that list of 11 cars looked completely different. 

For example, a list from 2015 mentions Lexus RX 350 4WD while the list from 2017 mentions front\-wheel Lexus RX 350 \(and that's already the closest I've found\).

"it seems to me that if the existing laws in some states regarding use of a phone while you are driving do not cover driving aids it would be wise to modify the law to require level 4 or higher to allow this kind of thing.

Its a good thing no firefighters were injured."
"I mean this driver seems like she was pretty upfront about the situation; she had autopilot on and stopped paying attention.  Fortunately for her, the repercussions were relatively minor.

This is one of the things that makes me glad for all the driver assistance features already out and hopeful for full self-driving being a regular thing - basically the only time there are consequences for bad decisions behind the wheel, they're potentially catastrophic.  There's no real feedback loop for improving or even maintaining good driving habits (at least not in the US - no re-testing, no enforcement of 'minor' issues, etc) so shit like this is gonna happen as long as it's normal for humans to be driving."
"Shouldn't this be easy to check in the logs? 

I thought we learned from the whole top gear incident. "
"The way Tesla is designed it’s amazingly great at logging everything. If autopilot was on before a crash, all they would need to do is look at the car logs. They did this with someone who claimed Tesla accelerated on its own into their house. Tesla disproved it by stating the person had the accelerator pushed down. 

https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1104345_tesla-refutes-owner-claims-of-model-x-sudden-acceleration-before-crash"
"Lol ya that’ll do them good, suing their customers. "
"How can you believe Tesla though. Why  couldn't they also lie to keep pr about their products good, particularly one with such a stigma around it. Given they made all the monitoring tech, I dont see it as being outside of their ability.

I mean dont get me wrong, Im not saying its a fact or even an assumption, just that theres a motive and a possibility and I dont think that should be ignored."
"Tesla automatically has logs anytime the autopilot is on, so they can prove one way or the other. Otherwise everytime someone was in an accident they would blame Tesla and sue. There is no way a company could ever develop a feature like that without very comprehensive logging."
"Wouldn't they be able to identify that easily?  
Like the blackbox in airplanes, holds all the events that had happened before the crash and it can be checked to see what caused the crash.  
They'll be tell whether autopilot was on or not."
Tesla can pretty easily look at logs and tell if it was on. Even with karge amounts of data they should be able to.
I suspect most lawyers would talk some sense into their client or refuse to take them if their plan was to try such an easily disproved lie.
"By that statement, she's just admitted that she was at negligent and at fault.

The problem in my eyes is that Autopilot enables people to act in this way."
"Well she said she was looking at her phone, so she did admit blame i guess."
"Amazing that though the headline quotes the driver as *saying* the autopilot was on, the actual article says:

>The driver of a Tesla electric car **had** the vehicle's semi-autonomous Autopilot mode engaged when she slammed into the back of a Utah fire truck Friday, in the latest crash involving a car with self-driving features.

Tesla should really have a talk with some of these reporters."
"A bunch of other folks already weighed in on this, but I don't think /u/Alpha_Tech was saying that he sat down, thought about driving in a Tesla, and reasoned that it'd be safer to drive aggressively.

Tesla's (and electric cars in general) have vastly different acceleration and speed profiles from cars with combustion engines which affords new options entirely when driving. Once a driver is attuned to these differences, the gap in traffic that seems like a ""safe lane changing gap"" might appear smaller. From a psychological perspective, this is a known phenomena (see [action-specific affordances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action-specific_perception)) and is completely natural / ""unconscious"".

Children don't notice themselves growing taller day by day, but naturally notice that they need to move differently to get on a chair, for example.

So, it stands to reason that some maneuvers outside of a driver's comfort zone in their old car would shift to within their comfort zone when driving a more powerful / faster car."
"I've driven a Tesla a handful of times, and it can definitely change how you drive. For example, knowing you can beat any combustion engine off the line at a stop light means you don't have to get into your turning lane until a block or two ahead of time."
"I don't own a Tesla but when I went from a 10 year old station wagon to a mustang I became much more aggressive. 

Holes in traffic suddenly become possible that weren't before. One of the biggest differences was people cruising in the left lane, you can get around them with margin to spare.

I can only imagine the feeling in a Tesla is orders of magnitude stronger."
">Can you elaborate on how and why you drive more aggressively, and what the capabilities of the car have to do with the decision? 

I assume he just means that he accelerates more (without speeding). And takes advantage of the acceleration whenever possible. Like when your engine has that kind of power and you want to pass a car, you can just step on it and fly around the car. But if you're in an older weaker car, you'd probably just stay behind the car and not try to pass it."
"I wouldn't say i'm a jerk ... but i can pass vehicles that in the past that I would have just stayed behind. It allows me to move quicker around slower vehicles. Also, I drive a bit faster (before I'd always stay under 10 miles over limit) but again, because I can go from 45 to 75 really quickly (when I'm only trying to get to 70) - I ended up staying at 75. "
"Camry. Yeah - the minivan is a nice and plush right (Sienna Limited), but performance was probably not even a consideration (and I'm OK with that). For volume and cargo space (and human space) nothing beats a minivan"
I'm sorry you went back to an ICE. I still have my ICE cars and drive the Tesla every opportunity that I can. 
You could get a more responsive car. I tend to drive my Mazdaspeed like I stole it.

"The statement was that Teslas are 4 times safer than the average car.  The issue is that the data does not support that statement because it doesn't take into account many differences in the data set that lead to those numbers.  Most important of which, the typical driver of a Tesla is different than the average driver on the road.

The statement leads someone to believe ""If you're driving a Tesla instead of an average car, you'll be 4x as safe,"" but that's not something proven to be true.

Musk also stated that Tesla is the safest car on the road, but the Model S does not have the best ratings from either the IIHS or the Euro NCAP."
"> If you look at adults in the same age range using other vehicles with somewhat similair features, like Ford's adaptive cruise control, crash avoidance, lane keep, you find that Tesla is still the safer car with less accidents.

Wait, is this really true? This seems to be what a lot of debate is about. This data isn't actually available...?

We're all waiting on Elon + other car companies to release it. Elon continues to quote the NHTSA stats, which are argued to not be detailed enough for proper analysis."
"Autopilot and autoland are separate systems. They are not fully automatic, for instance they may lack any sort of collision aversion. That remains the responsibility of the pilot, who must constantly scan the horizon for other aircraft, communicate with air traffic control, and adjust autopilot settings if necessary. 

An aircraft autopilot is generally meant only to maintain the heading and altitude set by a pilot, so the analogy to Tesla Autopilot is apt. 

An aircraft autoland is engaged at the end of a flight once a runway has been selected by a pilot. Teslas don't land on runways, but an autoland system is basically analogous to Tesla Autopark."

Which is a distinction without difference for the average person."

Because Toyota doesn't call it the safest car ever or tout it's crazy advanced self-driving features?

>The Prius, the bolt, the leaf, etc... all made headlines. 

Of traditional auto media, sure.  Of media that doesn't otherwise cover cars?  Not really.  The Bolt was quite a bit more than usual, but even that wasn't to the scale of the 3, and much of it was centered around it being a 3 competitor."
do you honestly think if the new Corolla broke that machine it would be front page news? Or page 17 news? Or a single person on earth would give a shit about the Corolla in some test?
"The driver claims autopilot was on, and previously there was another case of similar circumstances with antesla hitting a fire truck on a freeway. Look at the number of salvages or iihs claims for tesla. Minor crashes do NOT make national news.

Seeing what they can do with LiDAR can do when looking at the ground through a jungle canopy is super impressive. 
"Lidar didn't save the Uber from killing a pedestrian. And the ""skip lidar"" argument is that humans work with regular optical detection just fine and have none of the limitations that lidar has, so it's at the end of the day inevitably necessary to develop camera-based systems instead of going down the lidar intermediate path only to supplement its shortfalls with camera systems for full autonomy at the end. Skipping lidar makes things more difficult at first but also make it a more direct path to full autonomy."
"You are misunderstanding what he is saying. He is saying that mailbox and buildings are currently not a hazard to the Tesla. Therefore, the camera should be able, to some extent, to detect non-moving objects. He's not saying it's a useless thing, he's saying the Tesla already does this. "
"Yes, but the extent to which it is not fully autonomous is not clear to the average person. According to Wikipedia's article on airplane autopilots, it's justifiably vague.

""Autopilots in modern complex aircraft are three-axis and generally divide a flight into taxi, takeoff, climb, cruise (level flight), descent, approach, and landing phases. Autopilots exist that automate all of these flight phases except taxi and takeoff."""
"I don’t think people are thinking about the name when they’re looking at their phone whilst on autopilot, they’re doing it because they feel over-confident in the technology. Calling it anything else won’t change a thing. These people know they should be looking at the road. I bet they’re also the kind of people that would use their phone while driving in any old car."
"I hear you, but I'm not convinced. Else why not just call it ""driving assist"" or ""lane keeping with adaptive cruise control"". Tesla wanted to market their system as self-driving (or self-driving capable;  really soon—trust us, guys) to get an edge on the competition."
"It does not imply that. It specifically states that all control of the aircraft is done *without* any input needed by the pilot. Autopilot on an aircraft needs absolutely zero input from the pilot or co-pilot to fly the aircraft. Realistically the aircraft needs zero input from either pilot from takeoff to landing. 

Tesla does not have this capability. They are marketing their system with a name that is not misleading, it’s downright false. The car cannot completely control itself without driver input. It is not an autopilot system and they know this but for some reason keep using completely inaccurate terminology. An aircraft doesn’t need a pilot for takeoff, flight or landing. *That* is what autopilot is, not what Tesla markets their cars as having in terms of terminology. "
"That isn't misleading it's true (according to Tesla at least). They have all the hardware they will need to enable self-driving. What they don't have is the software, yet. It's an important thing to tell people, as well, because now you know that in the coming decade if Tesla achieves autonomous driving you'll be in on it.

Once again Tesla never advertised that their fleet is self-driving."

Easy: [Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_\(law\)). 

If they get sued, the plaintiffs lawyers get to see the log files. If Tesla doctors the logs, that changes a civil matter into a criminal one. It just ain't worth it. 

They will certainly do their best to spin things into the most positive light, and they could be slow to release damaging info occasionally if it suited them, but it's pretty doubtful that they would take the risk of actually trying to cover anything up."
"Try reading the next paragraph:

Everything is relative. My Miata feels like a boat compared to my sport bike. A Tesla is even faster.
"I dunno. I've got a decent 0-60 time, paddle shifters with less than 100 ms gear shifting, pseudo-manual mode so I'm not hampered by the automatic's shifting... it's just not exciting. Granted, I swapped the P85 for another straight-line boat of a car so it wasn't exactly designed for exciting but when you're moving liquids (aerosols I guess by the time the gas is in the cylinder?) and mechanical parts around it's just not physically possible to be as responsive as getting electrons out of the battery and into a stator or two.

When it gets close to time to turn this lease in, I may see if my broker will let me test drive something actually sporty but I'm really not expecting to enjoy any of it after having electric for two years.  I got to play around with a Fiat 500E a couple weeks ago - tiny though it may be, and as janky as its suspension is (I've felt more secure in golf carts lol), it solidified that I really just belong in an electric.

It sounds goofy but maybe it's just cuz I grew up on video games?  Regardless of total power, an electric responds less like something I'm piloting and more like a game avatar - there's no human-visible delay between me deciding to do something and the car responding to it."
"Yes, but you obviously haven't, or you don't understand what you read.

There is nothing definitive, just suspicions without any data.

the police (in the second article) said speed ""may"" have been a cause - but they couldn't determine the speed. 

Tesla makes a statement that things they saw indicate speed and that autopilot was not on - yet also state they had no access to the logs (ok, so how do they know autopilot was off?).  Were they even on site when they said that?

Now, speed, drugs, texting, or any other number of factors may have caused the crash, but I prefer to wait for facts before slamming two dead teenagers.

> Also, not that you should take my word for it, but I've also heard second-hand things as well   

Let me guess, you heard from someone whose cousin went to a party and saw of friend of one of the dead teenagers who said they heard that they read that Tesla stated that based on what they saw, speed was a factor and AP was off.

They do this as a habit, a really good one, but an aircraft can absolutely fly happily along with no input from the pilot at all. None. This is happening right now with thousands of aircraft flying around the world. 

>	An aircraft autopilot is generally meant only to maintain the heading and altitude set by a pilot, so the analogy to Tesla Autopilot is apt.

It absolutely is not. You can input an entire flight into the aircraft and it will fly you from your departure to your destination without the pilot putting any hand or foot on any control for the entire duration. Waypoints can be input, altitude changes can be entered and the aircraft will even land itself. Tesla’s system is in no way comparable. Not even close. 

You’re changing decades of aviation and aircraft capabilities down to what Tesla can do now and it’s wrong. Their system is nowhere near what autopilot actually is, they chose a name that would be marketable and it’s wrong. It doesn’t matter how anyone tries to change/dumb down aviation to its level, it’s not autopilot and shouldn’t be marketed or called that because that’s not what it is. "

Why is it astonishing that someone wouldn't admit fault which would result in higher insurance costs and possible points on their license?

The problem is it is extremely difficult without maps documenting where they are.  Waymo has been working on this and recently discussed some of the difficulties.  AI vision works in unpredictable ways, so (as one example) a vision system inappropriately read a stop sign as a 45mph speed limit sign because someone had put a sticker on it.

A human would simply see that as a stop sign with a sticker, but an AI vision system is looking for patterns based on its learning (likely from a database of pristine stop signs) that may be very different from the types of things we look for.

In any case, it's really difficult and likely not coming any time soon.  Or if it is released, will still require human monitoring..."

Musk has said himself that most of the autopilot crashes are not from new Tesla drivers, but from seasoned Tesla drivers."
"An autopilot could theoretically fly an aircraft across the ocean without pilot input, just like a Tesla could theoretically drive from Chicago to New Orleans without driver input.

But in real life, there are other aircraft in the sky and obstacles on the ground. Many aircraft autopilot systems will not detect or try to avoid a midair collision at all, and therefore this responsibility remains entirely with the pilot and ATC. 

Tesla Autopilot does try to detect and avoid collisions, which means that it's actually more advanced than many aircraft systems. But of course it's not perfect.

Therefore, Tesla drivers using autopilot must maintain situational awareness at all times, just as pilots do."
"I understand that wording, but apparently there are a ton of people who don't. There are people who have bought Teslas that don't. Again, you have a feature that is mostly self driving, people are going to treat it like it is fully self driving.

"What is the safety rating based on though? Overall safety or frontal crashes? Because the latter is the only relevant thing concerning the engine block difference between ICE cars and EVs, right?

It's probably correct that having no engine block helps building the front of a car in a way that absorbs impacts more efficiently but I agree with you that this doesn't make all ICE cars less safe than EVs."
No he hasn't... You stating that he changed his mind doesn't mean he actually did... Nothing even demonstrates that he changed his mind.
"Absolutely. It would be bullshit if Tesla were to be blamed for this shit, in my opinion. These features are there to help the driver, not fucking drive for them. It pisses me off that these assholes with more money than sense ruin it for everybody else.

"Of course, this is no different than drinking while driving and hoping autopilot will save you from the accident and DUI that follow."

Frankly, I'd rather just drive myself. At least I know when I fuck up, it's not because of an arguably *trained* faith in a technology which bears no responsibility.

I say trained, because repeated trips where the automation was fine will lull almost anyone into trusting it. It's like a weird twist on learned helplessness.

"> If they get sued, the plaintiffs lawyers get to see the log files. If Tesla doctors the logs, that changes a civil matter into a criminal one. It just ain't worth it.

Plenty of companies have proved that not only do they not mind being criminal, but that they can get away with it. Heck, find me a bank that hasnt.

If they can, I think that should be taken into account and we should never trust it based alone on feeling like the risk is too great for them to attempt it. 

If this were true all the time, on a personal level there would be no violent crime and on a company level there wouldn't be incidents like with GM ignitions failing and their substandard approach to fixing the issue.

This is a pretty open and shut case as far as causal factors. How the car did post-impact is what we all should be concerned with here.

"> You can input an entire flight into the aircraft and it will fly you from your departure to your destination without the pilot putting any hand or foot on any control for the entire duration.

Not every aircraft autopilot system has the capability to enter way points. Some just maintain a fixed heading and altitude, like I said. You knew this, of course, because you did your research.

So if a particular aircraft system is not capable of anything more complicated than maintaining a fixed altitude and heading, should we stop calling it an ""autopilot""? Because otherwise aviators might be confused (chuckle)!"

">	Do you actually think it matters and would make any difference?

Yes. Tesla right now is giving a false impression of what the car can do. The name alone is extremely misleading. One of these cars will happily drive right into a stantionary object with no warning given to the driver. It will follow the road right into a barrier because it isn’t good enough to tell the difference between stripes on the road in a construction zone. What people know as “autopilot” on aircraft does not do this. The system does not just happily fly you into an object. They chose a name they wanted to sound advanced, cool, awesome or whatever you want to call it and it’s false. It gives the user the wrong impression. 

>	The issue with the crashes isn’t the name of the software, it is the complacency of the user.

It’s both. The name lends itself to be able to do things it can’t and the user trusts it can. It can and is both. Anyone that’s ever done anything involved in human factors knows this. 

>	Musk has said himself that most of the autopilot crashes are not from new Tesla drivers, but from seasoned Tesla drivers.

I don’t trust Musk’ word. He’s know to outright lie to absolve himself and his company of any wrongdoing allegations. He’s been saying misleading or false statements for years. It doesn’t matter who is involved in these crashes, the name is not a true label for what the car is capable of. "
">	An autopilot could theoretically fly an aircraft across the ocean without pilot input

It’s not theoretical, it happens hundreds of times a day. If you’ve flown in any commercial aircraft your pilot had very little to do with actually flying the aircraft after takeoff. Hand flying aircraft hasn’t been a thing for decades. Especially across long over water flights. 

>	But in real life, there are other aircraft in the sky and obstacles on the ground.

And? That doesn’t change that what Tesla does is not even close to autopilot. 

>	Many aircraft autopilot systems will not detect or try to avoid a midair collision at all and therefore this responsibility remains entirely with the pilot and ATC.

They have other systems that monitor this. It’s called TCAS. It never ceases to amaze me that people can’t do basic research. It’s almost laughable how lazy people are and don’t even bother to try and research anything to push an ignorant narrative.

>	Tesla Autopilot does try to detect and avoid collisions, which means that it’s actually more advanced than many aircraft systems. 

This is laughably wrong.

>	Therefore, Tesla drivers using autopilot must maintain situational awareness at all times, just as pilots do.

And yet Tesla marketing their system as an autopilot system is absolutely false advertising. It doesn’t meet the definition and they’re knowingly giving people a false impression. They’re beta testing something on live roads and while it’s an awesome system that does good things, they need to stop trying to lie, misdirect and generally absolve themselves by using false or misleading statements. What they sell is not an autopilot system and they need to rename it. "

"Yeah but if you've used the autopilot a lot and it has always worked you grow complacent.

People in dangerous jobs receive training on the dangers of complacency, and many become complacent in any case and make dangerous mistakes. I'm a medical student and I've seen two doctors so far stick a used needle into their fingers while closing it. Capping a used needle (which you are never supposed to do btw) is very simple and it's not dangerous if you are paying attention, but you stop paying attention if it's the 100th time you do it.

In an OR before a spinal placement a patient was given morphine instead of midazolam because the nurse didn't read the label. You think you'd be careful handling dangerous drugs, and you are, but you stop when you've done this for years and nothing ever happened.

If the autopilot works almost all the time people will stop paying attention, and saying ""well it's the driver's fault"" won't solve the problem. I don't know if Tesla should be blamed, but they should work on a solution as their autopilot gets better and their cars more popular."
"I'm a little confused at how any company, not just Tesla, can sell a product they claim is an ""auto drive"" anything. Shouldn't at a bare minimum the wording be more accurate to call it assisted driving? I don't think Tesla is the only company doing this, but I'm against giving consumers technology called Auto Drive until an actual auto drive system exists."
"There is one point where I disagree with Tesla and Elon Musk... and it has started to bother me more than it used to with recent accidents.

Basically every other company that is still developing their driver-assist capabilities do not make the bold claim that their car can basically drive itself. Tesla flaunts their auto-pilot (which should be called something else) and then says ""but it's your liability"" in the fine print.

I think in the long-term, Elon's approach is going to save millions of lives. In the short-term, it may cost some."
"Tesla sells the thing as Autopilot/autonomous driving. Its all over their marketing then when people inevitably take that at face value its all their fault for not reading the fine print and thinking  *the safer than humans* autopilot will do it all alone?

No. I definitely think Tesla has some blame in this. Maybe when they make their marketing less grandiose I'll give it a pass. Currently, they make it seem like the only reason they arent going whole hog is because of slow legislation, not being actually unready for prime time."
"I just don't understand why they haven't focused heavily on accident avoidance more vs other things. Who cares how well within the white lines the car drives, the first thing I'd teach a machine learning autopilot would be avoiding cars, trucks, medians, etc. And having a false positive braking event sometimes might be worth it to eliminate slamming in the back of a firetruck. "
Do you think Tesla should adjust how it markets the Autopilot feature?
"> Frankly, I'd rather just drive myself.

Agreed. Yeah, Autopilot is nice, I've driven both AP1 & 2 but I wish I could just order TACC instead of the full package.

I think the more you use Autopilot the more complacent you become and the less you start paying attention to the road because it actually does work 99.9% of the time. I just want to be aware when that 0.01% instance occure.


Only way to ""fix"" autopilot is to have the sensor register both hands on the wheel at all times. Then you know the driver can't play with their phone/makeup/whatever."

You do think they say “well actually there are three different types all according to what kind of aircraft, the routes they fly, their flight time, passenger load and other capabilities affect what type they are equipped with”? Absolutely not. 

When you say autopilot to the average person they think of an aircraft flying without pilot input and it will happily fly itself and avoid obstacles all the way to their chosen destination. That’s what your average person thinks, and you seem to as well. Tesla cars do not have what 99% of people think of as autopilot capabilities. 

You can argue incorrectly it’s similar all you want, the marketing is extremely misleading or outright false to what it actually is capable of versus what people know as autopilot. Musk being misleading or outright lying about the cars performance doesn’t help anything either. He constantly cherrypicks it distorts data to keep his false narrative going. And people eat it up. Tesla make amazing cars, but they also misrepresent their business on a daily basis. I hope they succeed, I just wish they’d be more truthful about it. "
"> Because that's how you avoid liability

If people are unfamiliar with the term, then it's Tesla's obligation to explain how the system is meant to be used and to emphasize that driver attention is required even when the system is active.

Which is exactly what they do when you first enable the system.

> They're using a bad terminology.

The term is perfectly accurate.  Everyone who uses Autopilot has been warned, probably more than once, that driver attention is required.

I don't think the problem is in the language. People would read email on Autopilot even if you renamed it to something neutral, like Tesla Driving Buddy. Instead people would complain that they expected Driving Buddy to operate without supervision. 

I think the fundamental problem is that users have not properly adjusted their expectations when it comes to assisted driving in general. It's a pretty common problem whenever a disruptive technology emerges."

"I am not contending that every media outlet is controlled directly by these industries.  Its more subtle than that.  The number one rule for media business managers is to not piss off the advertisers.  

so of course channels like foxnews are going to be completely corrupt.  They will say climate change is a hoax, and they will spin news about tesla saying its losing money on every car it makes, but then not tell you the reason for that is tesla is in an extreme growth phase.  

something like Msnbc or cnn are less corrupt.  They will occasionally cover climate change but it will be exceedingly brief. Often when they cover climate change they will make it a debate between both political sides.  even though 99% of peer reviewed studies on subject say its not in question and civilization could potentially collapse.  Then the 1% who say it is in question could easily be investigated to find they have ties to fossil fuel companies.

 Both these channels will cover climate change once or twice a week for a few minutes.  But they will run ads from fossil fuel companies.  Generally these ads come in the form of the American Petrolieum institute talking about how many jobs they create.  Or exon will talk about how it is making biofuels which is a complete joke.  it is greenwashing.

If MSNBC and CNN were covering climate change the way it should be more frequently with actual scientists explaining it in detail, I would submit the car companies would threaten to pull their ads.  There business model is all about selling large amounts of SUV's and trucks.
This story discusses how many more pro fossil fuel commercials are run then stories on climate change https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cnn-climate-change-big-oil_us_571fa61ce4b0f309baeeca99
Some of the journalists from these companies understand climate change, but they are directed what stories will be the lead.  These journalists are essentially paid 20,000-30,000 a day not to bring the really important news.  If they started to try to exert more editorial control.  They would be moved to the weekend or fired.  The selection process for journalists is really the key point.  They are going to get journalists who will pretend to be neutral but are really just partisans.  They will pick journalists okay with talking about political gossip.

Then you have various halfway decent websites and newspapers who do a similar thing.  They hide stories in the back.  They write just enough to have plausible deniability, but no way are they going threaten the business of their advertisers.

Then are going to be numerous websites and newspaper that do all kinds of hit pieces on EVs.

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/electric-cars-are-not-necessarily-clean/

These articles have been written in the think tanks what these articles do not tell you
1.) is the grid is becoming increasingly renewable.  in 30 years we could easily have a 100% renewable grid
2.)  many EV owners also have solar panel systems.  solar panel systems dropping in price by 10% every year and in the future even more EV owners will have solar panel systems
3.)  for over a decade batteries have been falling in part by 16% per year in large part because of EVS have been increasing economies of scale.  These price declines are as certain to continue just like prices for computers decline.  buying a EV is one of the most important thing that can be done make a 100% renewable grid possible, because the last component of that grid is affordable battery storage.
4.) They will not tell you the battery of the EV can be used for grid storage after it is lost 20% of its capacity and the car has aged
5.) They will not tell you the battery can also be recycled, so in 20 years it will take much less pollution to make battieries
6.) they will not tell you how it is certain that EV technology will improve over time so it takes much less pollution to build and operate an ev
I could go on and on.

The media is continually printing and airing these stories that EVs are not that good for the environment.

anyhow I hope I have open your mind a little and you really start to question how the media cleverly does the bidding of their advertisers.

They will continue to print stories about every single tesla accident/fire to make people think they are not safe.  They will continue to say tesla is never going to turn a profit in order to making borrowing money more difficult.  tesla will continue to have to borrow money to build new factories as they continue to grow rapidly.  They are doing whatever they can to slow the transition.  because when EVs do eventually dominate.  all autocompanies are going have to fire thousands of workers.  retrain thousands more.  They will have to completely retool their factories or build new ones.  billions of dollars of intellectual property will become worthless.  They are doing whatever they can to slow the process.  any delay means billions of dollars saved."

Yes, and a Tesla driver does not have to ""hand drive"" their car when Autopilot is engaged. But they must still maintain awareness and be prepared to take over. Just  like pilots who engage aircraft autopilot.

It's pretty clear you don't understand what pilots are required to do even after they engage an autopilot. 

> It never ceases to amaze me that people can’t do basic research.

When you did your research, did you note that small aircraft do not always have TCAS? And if an aircraft does not have TCAS, it cannot be detected by an aircraft with TCAS? And that TCAS is never meant to be the primary means of avoiding collision? 

TCAS is like the collision warning sound a Tesla emits before applying emergency brakes. If it activates, you have already done something wrong. And if that's all you're using to avoid an accident, you will inevitably end up in an accident."
"> see if it's prevents more accidents than it causes and that's really hard to find out.

"It's funny how that works. As a climbing instructor I'm 'blessed' to see people make stupid mistakes pretty much every week, which instills me with the notion that humans are fallible, which in turn strongly reinforces the need for safe behavior (double checks, etc) for me personally. I've seen real accidents and many near-accidents in climbing. In my head safety checks are directly connected with the fear of fucking up and dying. 

On the other hand people quickly get complacent when things go well and their perception of risk goes down. For beginner climbers it's usually the third or fourth session where they start skipping safety checks or simply glance over the system and miss obvious mistakes. Really, it's not exceptional to have people redo the check twice before they sense something's off and actually start looking. 

I don't have to get stern or angry or anything. The sinking feeling that you could have hurt yourself or someone else badly drives the point home like nothing else. I'm not saying I work with stupid people, on the contrary: these are smart well educated healthy young adults who listen to instructions intently. It's simply in our nature. 
We need to be convinced that shit can go wrong to stay vigilant and therefore shit has to go wrong every once in a while. Either that or rigorous and continuous training, which is unrealistic in the case of driving. 

Consequentialists will argue all this isn't really an issue with autonomous cars, because the technology will at the very least be safer than 100% human drivers. Accidents will happen, but driving will be safer on average. I tend to agree with that. "
"Confusing roads tend to be safer. I remember watching a video about a town that hat a big ugly dangerous intersection near their center. They decided to ditch all the traffic lights and make it a free for all. Because of the confusion, drivers paid better attention and were more careful. I think the efficiency went up too."
"It isn't called ""auto drive"" anything - it is autopilot. 

On Wikipedia, this is used to describe autopilot - an idea we're most familiar with in relations to planes:

>An autopilot is a system used to control the trajectory of an aircraft without constant 'hands-on' control by a human operator being required. Autopilots do not replace human operators, but instead they assist them in controlling the aircraft. This allows them to focus on broader aspects of operations such as monitoring the trajectory, weather and systems.

"
"Don't they throw up a ton of warnings and things you have to agree to that explains exactly that? It's not a replacement for a driver and they don't make the driver think that at any point. The thing beeps and buzzes at you when you even take your hands off the wheel, so to be paying so little attention that you slam into a stationary car going highway speeds, that's the driver's fault. "
"I understand your concern about how Tesla markets Autopilot, but it is never called or advertised as ""auto drive"" anywhere by the company. There is a larger discussion thread that was started recently that talks about what people think of when they think of ""Autopilot"". However, to try and make it seem like Tesla is advertising something called ""auto drive"" \(quotes yours\) anywhere is only perpetuating the problem."
Autopilot in planes is the same way and nobody ever complains about that. They need to just not be dumb and actually learn about the features of the car they’re driving. Especially the one that controls it for you
Autopilots used to only maintain course and Altitude.
"Fun fact:  the first version of cruise control was called Auto-Pilot with a hyphen.

>	After working for almost a decade, Ralph Teetor received his first patent on his device in 1945, earlier known as “Speedostat”. However, his device was used commercially only years after in 1958 Chrysler Imperial, which was advertised as featuring “Auto-Pilot” technology. It was actually Chrysler who make the term “cruise control” popular.

[refrence](http://wagenclub.com/2015/01/ralph-teetor-blind-invented-modern-cruise-control.html)"
my car's an automatic
"Edit: TLDR: autopilot isnt self driving, its basically advanced cruise control.

The problem with that though is that autopilot doesn't actually mean self driving. Even in aircraft, autopilot simply keeps the aircraft steady. It doesn't change speed or direction, and a pilot must still be present in case they need to take control. Self driving cars havent been aproved, and the Tesla 3 isnt sold as a self driving car. In fact, Tesla's ai and autopilot system is more in depth than most autopilot systems. This is just people misunderstanding a term and trying to blame a company for their own ignorance.

While Tesla does boast about his cars a bit too much, the term autopilot has never been used to mean self driving or self piloting."
"Yup this is exactly the problem. They keep calling it autopilot and a cursory read of their website makes it seem like it drives for you etc. Even just  naming it autocruise or something would help. 

They should absolutely get rid of all mentions of autonomous driving for now at the very least. If they want to keep the name autopilot then ok I guess 

While technically Tesla are correct in what they say when you read the fine print this still provides the media with a means of attacking them every single time there is a crash. 

"
"I understand the name and such can be misleading, but doesn’t it remind you of this in the car when you activate it?  With keeping a hand on the wheel and such?"
In the short term it costs less though. The autopilot is still a better driver than if the people did it themselves. 
"> Basically every other company that is still developing their driver-assist capabilities do not make the bold claim that their car can basically drive itself.

Tesla does NOT make that claim..."
The good news is that it’s only going to get better and safer than it is today.
In the short term it has saved lives too. Don't forget that HUGE fact in your analysis 
"I don't know much about Musk or Tesla, but when you lock out all of your contractors and blame them for waste, I'd say you are having some problems with honesty and taking responsibility."
"What you say is fair but I’ve a different perspective; based on a personal anecdote I think the situation is even worse:

My car has “lane assist”. It’s the simplest of these types of systems... it just and only beeps if you drift out of your lane. I don’t have any cruise control or other features at all. None. 

On a recent road trip I busted a friend totally ignoring the road. His defense was that the lane assist would tell him if he needed to pay more attention.  (Yes, I was pissed).  

My friend didn’t know the name of this feature or even that it existed until he started driving my van. He starts driving - had it beep at him - and immediately trusted it with our lives. If even a small percentage of people act the same way we are fucked. 

I think we should focus on “emergency take over with zero interaction during normal driving” or compete full autonomous driving. 

"
"They market it as ""auto pilot"" assisted driving and promise it can be upgraded to full autonomous driving in the future.

The press seems to think that the cars are being sold as self-driving today.  They are not."
"Absolutely. I think they want it to be a full autopilot and jumped the gun by using this name on a beta SEMI-autonomous feature. I've never seen them market it as a full real autopilot, but I do see how the name could lead people to believe that."
Tesla has both of these systems (Forward collision warning and AEB)
Have you not seen the many news stories about companies getting fined for doing just that? Why are you so keen on believing this is rare and assuming that Im conflating anything?
"and despite that people still do it...

[https://electrek.co/2016/09/25/tesla\-model\-s\-crashes\-into\-gym\-driver\-claims\-autonomous\-acceleration\-tesla\-says\-drivers\-fault/](https://electrek.co/2016/09/25/tesla-model-s-crashes-into-gym-driver-claims-autonomous-acceleration-tesla-says-drivers-fault/)"
"Your comment seems to suggest you think Tesla knowing whether it is on or not is somehow bad. In reality, there is no way a feature like autopilot would ever be sold without comprehensive logging. 

Think about it... Without Tesla knowing all the details, every time someone was in an accident, they would just say it was autopilot's fault and sue Tesla. It would be up to Tesla to argue that they weren't responsible, but could not actually show that they weren't. The liability exposure would be insane, and no company would ever be foolish enough to sell a product like that. 

So yeah, I get that the logging is kinda horrifyingly big-brotherish, but I completely understand why they do it. "
">I read the articles and quoted some parts that said they think speed MAY have been a factor.

Teenagers with a recent history of reckless speeding crash at high speed in a fast car on a highway. Plausible? Lol

>What was the cause of the speed that MAY have been a factor?

Being a teenager with a lead foot. I did >100 mph for about 15 minutes straight on I-95 in Ft. Lauderdale every Monday night from when I was 16 until I was 18. In hindsight, the only reason I didn't end up dead or disabled is because I understand car control, had experience operating *much* faster machines, and I had a continuous trickle of good luck. Without any one of those things I'd be in an article just like those ones. Teenagers just do stupid shit, and sometimes the luck runs out. It's not an indictment on these guys in particular (although it *is* another level of stupid to speed like that anywhere other than an empty, well-lit highway), it's just what teenagers do and sometimes shit catches up with you really quick.

>why did that Tesla suddenly accelerate into a Starbucks the other day? Or into a gym a couple weeks ago?

I'll assume ""wrong pedal syndrome"" until proven otherwise. It's not like it's uncommon in normal cars, and Teslas are even more responsive to such a mistake.

>Some people sure like to convict people before the facts are in, “we got him!” (Boston bomber) and enjoy the idea of being part of a lynch mob in their efforts to defend a multi-billion dollar company. It seems to be good for their emotional stability.

I was criticizing the way Tesla has presented Autopilot years ago, I invite you to look through my submission history. The phenomenon I worried about then was the same that led to the recent barrier crash in California. I harbor no special feelings for Tesla, it's just another company that I'll criticize when appropriate."
Are you seriously saying that 12 year old beat up Honda and Tesla drivers have the same demographics? 
"You're the one who brought up sample sizes......I agree, it's irrelevant here, I even said it up above. The problem is that the demographics aren't the same. 

So yes, you can say that Tesla drivers crash less often. That's absolutely true. You can't say that Tesla cars are safer since so many other things effect that, and you need to control for them. "
"Well it seems like common sense to me, but since you apparently want some sort of data, [here's an article from 2014](https://247wallst.com/special-report/2014/10/02/cars-with-the-oldest-buyers/2/) listing the car brands with the oldest buyers in the United States.

1.  Lincoln
2.  Buick
3.  Bugatti
4.  Cadillac
5.  Lexus
6.  Jaguar
7.  Bentley
8.  Smart
9.  Chrysler
10.  Mercedes-Benz

Luxury brands seem to be pretty heavily represented in that list, and I don't think that's a coincidence.  Does that mean only old people buy luxury cars or that no young people buy luxury cars?  Of course not.  But it takes more money to buy expensive vehicles, and older people tend to have more money than younger people.  And sure, some people with a lot of money buy their kids nice cars as well.  But certainly not all of them do.  I'm sure that Teslas even skew younger than a lot of other luxury brands given they appeal to a younger tech crowd.  But there still aren't many people paying for an $80k vehicle as their first new car out of college.

Also, a quote [from this article](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/05/sorry-elon-musk-theres-no-clear-evidence-autopilot-saves-lives/):

>""To own a Tesla, mostly you have to be mature enough to amass enough wealth to buy one,"" said Philip Koopman, an automotive safety expert at Carnegie Mellon. ""You tend to get more middle-aged drivers who are in the safest demographic.""

Of all the things I've posted on this site, I never would have fathomed that this would be a controversial idea."
"When you say the word ""personal assistant"" to your average person, what do you think they think it means?

Whatever that is, it's someone far more capable than Siri. Yet Siri was marketed as a personal assistant and nobody batted an eye. Because people are more capable of adjusting to reality than you seem to think. Meanwhile, you insist on holding Tesla to an unreasonable standard."
"> If people are unfamiliar with the term, then it's Tesla's obligation to explain how the system is meant to be used and to emphasize that driver attention is required even when the system is active.

Or they could not use misleading terminology.

>I don't think the problem is in the language. People would read email on Autopilot even if you renamed it to something neutral

But that then shifts the liability to the customer. 

Again, there is a common belief about the term ""autopilot"". Tesla knows this. By using the term, they are opening themselves up to liability based on a reasonable interpretation of the word."

"This whole post is about Tesla getting rammed in the news every time someone crashes one.

">	Yes, and a Tesla driver does not have to “hand drive” their car when Autopilot is engaged.

This is true, but it still doesn’t have all of the capabilities that autopilot in aircraft does. 

>	But they must still maintain awareness and be prepared to take over. Just like pilots who engage aircraft autopilot.

The difference is they have to have their hands on the wheel and feet on the pedals. Autopilot does not require this. 

>	It’s pretty clear you don’t understand what pilots are required to do even after they engage an autopilot.

I do. I’m just not invested in defending Tesla for their misleading or outright false statements of their capabilities. 

>	When you did your research, did you note that small aircraft do not always have TCAS? And if an aircraft does not have TCAS, it cannot be detected by an aircraft with TCAS? And that TCAS is never meant to be the primary means of avoiding collision?

I absolutely do know this. Is there a reason why you’re trying to tell me that no systems on aircraft are linked together? That all must be watched and monitored separately? You keep trying to tell me things like autopilot, autoland and other systems are separate and act like they don’t work together. What narrative are you trying push? Are you trying to convice me that Tesla is equivalent to aviation systems? Because no matter how much you love Tesla, what they sell is not autopilot. Not even close.

>	TCAS is like the collision warning sound a Tesla emits before applying emergency brakes.

Tesla’s cannot detect stationary objects. One slammed into a fire truck. I really don’t know how you people convince yourselves of things like this. You have to throw out honest facts and real world failures to keep pushing this nonsense. "
"Go on then show me that I am wrong,  you can respond by typing while you are sitting in one of his mass produced cars while the auto pilot is on. "
"This is really valid thank you. I can't help but think if we're having consumers deal with Boeing 747 style terminology that it's a recipe for disaster, but more training could do just as well."
I would bet there are plenty of people who believe that an aircraft's autopilot can take it from terminal to terminal with zero human input. I'd say it's still a confusing term for marketing.
I have a feeling most people believe autopilot doesn't require any human operation.
"There's a warning dialog that clearly spells out that autopilot is **not** self-driving that you have to accept before you can use it for the first time.

Every time you turn it on, there's an alert that says to keep your hands on the wheel and be prepared to take over at any time.

It forces you to tug the wheel a little every few minutes.

If after all of that and being constantly reminded to keep your hands on the wheel you think it's a replacement for you paying attention, natural selection is free to run its course."
"I mean I gave you an upvote for contributing to the conversation but I highly believe that consumers will see ""auto"" in the name and assume it's more automatic than it is. I very much so understand that Tesla isn't directly responsible for this but I also think Tesla, and every other company in this market should be regulated as if the person driving is not someone with any technical knowledge."
Or you know Autopilot name has nothing to do with it and humans are prone to distracting driving with or without a driver assist system. If they called it Tesla driver assist there would still be people running into things not paying attention just as there are people doing that everyday with no driver assist system.
This I would agree with... Crazy # of people who seem to think it's fun or funny to trick Tesla into thinking their hands are on the wheel and let the car drive itself.
https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/799910213851590656?lang=en
My lane assist in my qashqui only beeps. It also has a steering assist... It just breaks a little to keep on line. With those two together I thought I'd have the ability to let go for a bit and itd bing me in if it drifted. No. Not at all. It's just a warning to force you to watch the line a bit better. Won't work below a speed and doesn't work in all conditions or in all types of marking. This I only learnt from experience. What I wish it would do is detect the edge of the road and instead of only when you cross the line that would be more useful especially in the qq as it's got a huge left hand pavement side blindspot.
"> Have you not seen the many news stories about companies getting fined for doing just that?

No I have not."
"And despite that they're still called out. If Elon is out on the war path on twitter, ya think he would have brought that up?"
"I'm just starting the facts broseph. Telemetry is useful, prehaps dangerous and arguably necessary, but the fact is the guy above me is trying to pin the reporter on false news.

The thing is tho, Elon is on Twitter bringing up arguably unrelated stats instead of calling out the driver for lying."
"This is cute, now you want to change your argument and now claim its not who is driving, but age of the cars?

haha, you just invalidated yourself.  And no, 12 year old cars are not beaters, quality is way up on older cars.  And no, age doesn't change anything.  New cars still lack anything close to autopilot.

Emergency breaking would be the only feature that could change numbers and most new cars still don't have it."
"> You're the one who brought up sample sizes

Ah, your ignorance and inability to understand is somehow my problem?  You are laughable."
"Oh dear, so you think because other sample sizes can be larger, 200k isn't enough?  Shut up."
">	Whatever that is, it’s someone far more capable than Siri.

I absolutely agree with that. Siri is called something it pretty much isn’t. 

>	Yet Siri was marketed as a personal assistant and nobody batted an eye.

I don’t know if you follow tech news, but it has been very seriously criticized for its poor performance when it came out and has been since. It’s widely regarded as almost useless. I myself can’t stand how much praise it gets despite it’s seriously bad performance. "
"""Autopilot"" is not misleading. It's just unfamiliar.

Autopilots exist for aircraft, and autopilots exist for ships. Now they also exist for cars. They do the same thing in all cases, and soon enough drivers will understand what skippers and pilots already understand.

Decades ago, ""computers"" were large machines found only in labs. The general public did not understand what they did, and many thought ""computer"" meant ""AI"". 

Then computers became commonplace. Now most people know the difference between computer and AI. We don't expect a computer to be highly intelligent, sometimes we expect the opposite. 

But how strange would it have been to call desktop computers ""supercalculators"" when they were introduced, just to avoid misunderstanding!"
"That has nothing to do with intentionally making something difficult to impossible to repair, not making parts available and having their repair shop the only possible option with  with unrealistic terms, pricing and lead-time.  Besides, not only should the electric drivetrain be easier to repair, there are still plenty of other simple things that you should be able to fix yourself.  It sounds like tesla is in violation of every ""right to repair"" bill/law/legislation which is a shame because otherwise, it might be a practical car to have."
"Again, completely FUD.  You can make a vehicle repairable but making it more difficult is done intentionally by many auto brands (some more than others) so you rely on their overpriced service centers.  If Tesla wants to be the John Deere or Apple of cars, They can go fuck themselves.  They're perfectly capable of non /r/assholedesign"

"If someone looks at their phone while using AP, and it crashes into the back of a firetruck, is that AP's fault or the person's fault for not monitoring AP while it was in use?

If it is the second, how can you claim AP is safer than a human?   

You can't have it both ways.  AP can't both be better than a human when used correctly and require a human to be used correctly.

> Please, explain to me how AP makes people less safe.

AP can make people more safe and not be safer than a human.  Like power steering, anti-lock brakes, etc.  It would be absurd to claim a tool used to increase human safety is more safe than than the human using it.  It doesn't make sense."

Most of these people think what they are doing is good.  They justify so many actions which are unethical to get to their goals. They are surrounded by peers who think and act the same. if climate change did not exist it would be okay to a degree, but they are not willing to see the truth because they are thinking about self-interest for them, their family, and their associates

"I might be biased, but I don't think of autopilot as flying the plane for the whole trip. They hold a heading, altitude and speed; that's it. On the really big commercial airliners they can also land when connected to an airport with landing guidance.

When Sully hit the geese, he didn't hit the autopilot and tell it to land on the hudson, it isn't capable of that at all. Same thing with the car. You can tell it what speed to maintain, and which lane to keep. Thats it. It also has some basic collision avoidance."
"The point is that some people think autopilot means that the plane flies by itself and that the tesla autopilot thus drives itself. Depending on how you see it the tesla autopilot is actually more autonomous than an airplane autopilot. An airplane can't stop mid air so the autopilot just disengages when it encounters a problem it can't safely solve.  

Day one on autopilot training you will learn: The auto flying system does not fly the airplane. The pilots fly the plane through the automation.  

It's crazy to me that some tesla owners on autopilot will be less hands on than an airplane captain. The road is a much more chaotic and crowded place than the skies."
"Here's an idea that is not realistic: People should become more aware of what they're buying and using on a daily basis. Such as how to safely operate their 4000lb Powered Steel Deathtrap. If that means they need to be of a high enough literacy and mental capacity to understand the difference between driver replacement and driver assistance and that others need to seek simpler modes of transportation, so be it. 

If you want to look at your phone on your way to work, catch a bus, you'll have plenty of time to stare at your phone. 

Tesla's out here being incredibly realistic and firm on their standpoint and the people that treat them like complete jokes are those that will be firmly left behind by the tech advancements of the next 20-30 years."

I have to take a rather vehement opposition to this statement.  
it is not Tesla's fault that deregulation and GOP budgets have so obliterated driver training programs in schools as well as the DMV's ability to properly evaluate and properly ensure new drivers are ready for the road.  Laws should be adapted here, but not to force cars to deal with stupid drivers, we should instead focus on teaching drivers not to be stupid.

"It's not semantics, claiming AP is

> safer than human drivers

is flat out wrong.  And dangerous to promote.  If it was safer than human drivers, human drivers should be able to stare at their phones and let it do its thing

> AP saves lives

That's inconclusive and says nothing about severity of accidents.  it could both prevent minor accidents and increase fatal ones, for example.  There are plenty of vehicles with lower fatality rates per/mile than Tesla that don't use autonomous features, and according to AAA, Model S owners have made 46 percent more insurance claims on average than owners of other passenger vehicles."
That piece has nothing about Elon changing his mind.
"And airplane autopilots can fuck up with temperature changes, icing, or magnetic variances. Its not ""forget you're in charge of the vehicle"" pilot."
"What signs can the current version detect? None. Pedestrians? Maybe. Not that I know of. Where are are you getting this info from? 

All this are capabilities that do need to be added. "
"The root cause is what some people THINK autopilot a plane actually is. It legitimately IS autopilot, the problem is that what some people think autopilot is, is wrong :)  

This is a very common problem. Here are a few examples:  

1. People (even most gun enthusiasts) MASSIVELY over estimate the stopping power of a handgun with conventional ammo. Yes, a single round is deadly, but not instantly. ""Why did they shoot the guy 10 times?"" Because a couple of pistol rounds centre mass usually isn't enough to stop an adrenaline jacked maniac in his tracks. A round from a Glock 9 to the chest won't stop a guy from running towards you. It might kill him in a few minutes, but he'll still be able to run for a while. The one pop-drop is  just in the movies.

2. ""It's just a theory."" In science a theory is the surest explanation model available for a particular issue. There are no higher level than theory.  

3. AI is going to become self aware and we need to prepare to give them rights. No. Artificial intelligence and artificial consciousness are two wildly different subjects, and we are no closer to AC in machines now than 30 years ago. Only in the movies can you add a bunch of nodes in a neural network and suddenly achieve self awareness. There are a bunch of different dangerous paths with AI we need to adress. That will be harder to do the more regular people think it's about consciousness and not highly specialized AI."
"No, the root problem is people who are so careless that they would risk their lives and the lives of others because they made baseless assumptions about a life or death situation based on a brand name. 

Blaming the name of an amazing safety system because one idiot thought (without reason) that it meant it would be okay to play on the phone while cruising at 60 mph in a multi-ton chunk of metal on wheels shows a concerning lack of emphasis on personal accountability.

We can't give people a pass because they didn't bother to think."

Nice job invalidating everything you said in this thread. 
This is literally the same exact logic that brought about DRM schemes and we all know how well that worked out.  Mandating Tesla tries to save their drivers from their own stupidity will serve only to drive legit users off the platform and encourage the rest to find new and creative ways of circumventing whatever it is you mandate.
"Just to be sure, that wasn’t meant to be insulting to you, I just noticed a lot of people talking about the apparent marketing for it but I thought the in-car use of it was pretty clear on where the technology stands.

"No it's a demo of functionality they're developing. You're trying to intentionally misinterpret this to suit your own opinions. I don't understand why you're doing this.

No a concept would be a 3D CG video showing simulated images of cameras. This is certainly not that. It is ACTUALLY driving itself that distance. That doesn't mean that it can do it that well always or that it can do it on non-prepared routes. That's why that software isn't released, because it would be unsafe to do so.

> especially compared to mature car makers who have competitive technologies and don't make similarly bold or flashy claims.

No car companies have full self-driving functionality even to this level. They do have Autopilot-similar technology, but it tends to be less accurate and ping-pong back and forth between lanes."
Age of the car is meaningless. But different drivers isn't meaningless. Unless you are saying teenagers drive the same as wealthy old men. Which they don't. Tesla demographic distribution is nothing like the general population.

"I meant how in English, 'autopilot' (without someone actually looking up or being told the definition), seems like it means automatically piloting which implies the more full autonomous AI control. I.e. the guy who originally came up with the term in the first place caused this indirectly by making it seem like something it is not."
I was referring to the root cause of the confusion of the autopilot term (as that is what letmeseem is talking about). I'm in agreement that stupid people are stupid.
"Something like ""assisted driving"" would make it more clear that it supplements driving instead of replacing it. I'm not saying you can't easily research the term and find out what it means in an aviation context. Anyone who knows exactly what autopilot does in an airplane would probably know what it does in a Tesla.

Even though autopilot is a specific term, it *sounds* like automatic pilot, which *sounds* like the car drives automatically, which *sounds* like you don't have to do anything. If you don't know much about aviation (like most people, I'm assuming) and all you know is that a new car has autopilot, it's really easy for me to imagine you'd assume the car drives by itself.

It's important to be educated and I'm sure neither of us would make a mistake like that, but I don't think it's enough to stop there if the goal is to keep the maximum number of people safe. Safety design is often about making the assumption that people will do minimal due diligence and *still* keeping them safe through smart design. For example, buildings are designed to have bright, obvious emergency exits. Imagine if the solution was instead to put a fire exit map on the building's website and blame fire victims for not doing their due diligence by reading through it first. It's just a better idea to think about how to keep even the dumbest motherfucker safe."
"Advertising is not the same as marketing strictly. Tesla releases statements on their website and has official marketing material on there as well. The ""Paint it Black"" self-driving video is an example that went completely viral.

Elon Musk is a popular personality and he knows it. He's an entertainer as well as CEO."

Cute, but their are almost 200k cars out there shared by buyers and their families.  Acting like only rich old white men are driving them is so incredibly stupid.  These are family cars. Many people buy them for their spouses.  Their kids drive them.  These are not sports cars locked in a garage."

"In that case, ""computer"" was a bad name for the Altair, ""drone"" was a bad name for DJI products (it previously only referred to fixed wing aircraft, or maybe bees), random access ""memory"" is inappropriate for something that is so easily overwritten/lost, ""cell"" phones are misleading because they do not contain cells, and ""Navigator"" was a bad name for TomTom products (everyone knows ""navigation"" refers to the sea!)

"No other automaker I know of refuses to sell parts, only has their own repair shops as an option and refuses to repair a car out of warranty or refuse warranty service on a car if somebody fixed something trivial on their own."

Also from that report ""The overall rate of driver deaths for 2014 models is 30 per million registered vehicle years, ""

Average mileage in the first year of a new car is 19,000, so it appears that the average new car goes 633 million miles per fatality. Twice as safe as the average Tesla.



"
"Another consideration as to why the semantics argument is BS:

You're language is too sloppy to distinguish between AP and a vehicle with true level 5 capabilities that was (actually) safer than a human, or a more primitive cruise control system that worked only in moderate highway traffic, etc.  Virtually any and all of these systems would be ""safer than human drivers"".

Sloppy, illogical language that promotes dangerous behavior."

> 1. Create a low volume car, which would necessarily be expensive

Fuck Tesla’s. I’ll always stick with a petrol and manual car.
Same here man
[deleted]
It's the sexiest car i've ever driven. Hands down.
"Buy a used Model 3 in a few years or take over someone's lease, these are inexpensive as hell. That's even before you start counting the money you save on gas! Compare the prices from a $/month perspective."
"Oh man me too. I’ve been on a “I want a Tesla soooooo bad” kick for the longest time. And my dad, an avid electric car disliker, keeps asking me why? I explain it to him. He says I should just get a Nissan (whatever electric car they have). I’m like “NO! Tesla or nothing!”

One day. ONE DAY I will have one. Dammit. "
Same
You could try something cheaper like heroin?
"Planning to buy a plain black and have it wrapped in matte something. Probably dark grey or anthracite.

That is if they ever come to Europe"
"I think the model 3 starts around $36K? I don’t think that’s too bad, much cheaper than their other models that’s for sure.

I’ve never cared for Tesla’s, but over the last few weeks I’ve been more and more interested..now I kinda want one"
"Lol, same here."
And theyre comin out with the convertible too 😍
Wisconsin is not Boulder. 414 is not 303.
It looks like what the Black Panther would drive
I was about to say the same. Black looks awesome. The stripes look odd.
Seriously that line just ends like that on front? Bleh
[deleted]
For real. What if my boss had walked by and saw me looking at such smutt. That amount of sexy must come with a warning. 
My boss caught me masturbating to this in the office. They’re having a meeting about me on Monday.
I'm also not a fan of fake NSFW posts.
I mean it is nice but....You owe us...
What's the difference?
[deleted]
"I think it looks nice in this pic, but I'd never want it myself. And matte is a huge pain to keep up with based on the majority of cars i see with this (i.e. they look terrible) "
"I feel the same. Maybe I’m getting old too! It is not my cup of tea. But as long as OP loves it, that is all I care about. "
Good taste never gets old
"I don't mind the black but I think debadging it removes something. Tesla's are pretty bland from the front because they don't have front intakes or cooling system, you need something to break up the nose."
I think this sub is weird.  They all have money but have never modified a car basically ever so the sub generally has the taste of 17 year olds who think autozone is where you get dope wheel covers.  
"How is age related to whatever or not you like a color? lol

I’m 17 and I also prefer stock over this. I also have a Grand Marquis with a ton of chrome all over it, which is an old fashioned automotive style that is falling out of favor, but I love it. 

EDIT: Thanks for the downvotes, remind me not to ask a logical question on this sub again"
"This is satin, not matte."
Lol I was just about to say this
"No , but they were a little lighter than the paint "
It’s sexy 
No I’m sorry :( 
I definitely took a video of water droplets on your roof
How are you liking red?
Could have used you there Teslas are severely underrepresented at car shows. 
Saw this at my local cars and coffee
yep
It still is
"It's basically got the front end of Porsche 911. Your opinion is your own, but plenty of folks enjoy this look independent of brand."
Yeah! My favourite EV with my favourite ICE
What the fuck. A shit monte Carlo?
The place I went to usually wrapped around and covering the edges for full wraps like stealth.

Yep that’s where I took the picture 
Why tho?
"I've never tried to maintain one myself, I don't like the look anyways, but even at exotic car shows I've never seen a matte black finish that actually looked nice. Even the matte black Lamborghinis we're splotchy and uneven. So my only assumption is, yes it is as hard as people say. "
[deleted]
Nope
Yes 😩😩😩💦💦💦💦
hood is not symmetrical on the 3. It bulges slightly out on the right side to make space for the windscreen wipers.
"I would argue this is significantly different with the matte and white accents, so it should be allowed in the main area.  I have seen plenty of unique S/X paint jobs go through the main page.  "
Why? 
Me too thanks 
"When the Model 3 becomes more readily available, there will be more used Model S’s on the market and I’m thinking their price will drop since lots of people will “upgrade” to the 3"
[removed]
"The thing people don't ever seem to understand about buying a used car is that cost of ownership is typically similar to the original purchase price.

The batteries on these are incredibly expensive to replace. The original warranty doesn't last forever... and they say a replacement battery is something between a third and half the cost of the original purchase price.

It's just like how used BMWs and Mercedes have exceedingly high maintenance costs compared to the typical Honda/Toyota/Ford/etc"
"My father is heaps old-school too. Still under the impression electric cars are ""slow"". But then again so is most of the population."
Same as my dad. I keep telling him the first gen leafs have horrible battery degradation.
Front trunk or nothing.
55k right now.
You basically can't get it for that price right now and it's not known when/if a 35k model will ever really be mainstream.
"Nah, I've seen him driving around in a Lexus lc500h. "
"One should point at those stripes and yell . . .
What are those ?"
Wait I though OP was going to peel them for us in a video for satisfying subreddit.
Not really. The model 3 front bumper is easy
Stupid sexy Tesla! 
He didn't join you for a circle jerk session or a Dutch rudder even? I'd quit that's terrible management. He should have at least coached you to climax 
Woah Good luck man 
Username confirmed.
I'm OK with it.
When I saw NSFW I had to check carefully for presence of tits and ass but on not finding either I got so mad.
"Satin has more of a reflective matte finish. Matte is..., matte."
"“Uh, it’s Sah-TEEN.”

(...obscure references for $200, Alex)"
How / why? Maybe it's just a foil?
"Matte/satin wraps are actually way easier to maintain. You just wash them. You never have to polish or wax. 
"
"This is probably a wrap, not paint."
That was so popular.. I definitely took video of people taking videos of water droplets on the roof. Must have been a hundred people who did that. Even if it does not rain I should bring a water bottle to make the roof wet in the future. Lol
It’s the best color. 
Lets go next month! We should try to get as many Teslas as possible. 
"Got a quote from a local Xpel certified dealer who said it would take two days and $5,400 to wrap my Model 3 in stealth, butbthey could only get within 1/16th of inch to the edge of each panel. 

Sounds like I need to keep looking?"
I did the same today. One of the cooler cars there because of the rain. 
did you see the car
"Interesting, good to know!"
"Regardless of symmetry, Tesla's have a problem with keeping all of their body panels straight.  Walk up to any one at random and the door panels, hood, or trunk will very likely be misaligned. "
"I hate the idea of a self driving capable car. People will be buying these and there’s going to be so many more accidents. Also, I like driving."
The 3 is a downgrade in every way from an S
Yes. They died. 
How many human driven cars have been in accidents involving death since the last auto pilot incident?
Mod note: removed.  Trolling.
"Total cost of ownership is typically much less on a used car (Honda, Toyota, Ford, etc). Luxury makes like BMW and Mercedes don’t fit this mold because of a combination of their extremely high maintenance costs and the free maintenance until 100k miles or whatever it is now.
"
"Batteries are getting better over time, of course you will have to pay a lot for a range upgrade. You are adding value to the car, that's not comparable to a high maintenance cost at all, especially when the car has barely any required maintenance at all.

You need *less* maintenance than BMW's and Mercedes, or even Honda/Toyota/Ford. The battery only needs to be replaced every 8.5-10 years too! There could possibly be ""same range"" battery options too that is less expensive."
"Yah he thinks it’s not worth it to have to stop and charge them. I keep explaining that they’ve come a long way, especially Tesla. 

This example is his argument: in December 2017 my husband and I went to the Blue Ridge Mountains for our honeymoon. It was roughly 4 hours away, around 200 miles. He said “you wouldn’t make that without having to stop and charge it.”  I said no shit, we also had to stop and eat, and get gas. And it’s not like I’d be driving 200+ miles daily. That was one time. Lol. A Tesla would get me to work and back, on one charge since I work 20 miles away. 

Now he constantly picks on me about it. He’s a Dodge Challenger guy. He has a 2015 B5 Blue Dodge Challenger Hellcat. It’s his baby. He saw the pic OP posted above and my response to the top comment and said “you think that looks hot?”  I said “yes....”. He just shook his head. 

Whatever. I will own one one day. "
"Instructions unclear, bought a 911"
"I had a smart roadster with a front trunk. That thing was a suicide machine too!  Seriously though, pinching my pennies hard for a Model 3. I work across the road from a Tesla dealership and it’s torture!!!"
49k
"What do you mean you can’t get it for that price now and it’s not known if a 35K model will be main stream?

Sorry, but I’m not super educated when it comes to Tesla’s."
"It’s worth mentioning that there are other costs too - insurance is high (I pay a bit more on the Model 3 than I did on a Porsche Cayman) and while it’s definitely cheaper than gas, there is a cost to electricity. My elec bill went up by about $55 a month."
That is a pretty baller car though. 
Saw him in Atlanta driving a charger. 
He drives a Prius pfft
Kk thx fam
"It's okay, we get them here!"
Model 3 is the best color. 
I will join. That’s at least 3!
Yes. The official XPEL place gave me a higher quote and precut everything. But I found another certified place hand wrapped for cheaper. Still used XPEL. They also carried feynlab and I could tell it was legit. Check out your local Tesla FB fan group. See where they are getting things wrapped.
maybe. but you havnt seen a fisker karma yet ha.
"Wait... so f*** Tesla’s because they offer the ABILITY of a drivers assistance software? Their mission is create sustainable transportation so you’re against that ? 

“Petrol” cars have had varying drivers assistance programs since 2012 which also could make people “complacent” 
"
self driving is not mandatory. I personally use it like anyone would use cruise control. Works great in stop and go traffic. 
"Not every way...

Obviously the S is meant to be the flagship, but the 3 has advantages. Offhand: it charges faster (in MPH)."
"That’s, like, your opinion, man. "
"That’s pretty subjective. I prefer a smaller car, and I like the lines on the model 3 better. "
"I know from the standpoint that it’s supposed to be the entry level Tesla vehicle, but it being newer may have some features that the S simply doesn’t have yet until it is refreshed. Still, people will say it’s an “upgrade” just because it’s the new Tesla."
yup i'm so talking from beyond the grave
But technology bad /s
"2900$/year if it's per ten years. If you're buying it 8 years used @ say 20k, that means after a couple years you're spending more than you bought it used for... 

You're still going to need a lot of maintenance over time because all of the mechanical parts wear out. There's been at least one user saying that a commerically used model S required a [drive unit replacement outside of warranty and it cost 15k.](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1093713_tesla-model-s-drive-unit-replacements-how-big-a-problem) Same article mentions that over a quarter of owners have had their drive systems replaced from the early batches of Model S but this article is from 2014. The model 3 is still new, it will have it's own issues that will get better in time.

Don't assume that maintenance costs for this car will be lower than an equivalent luxury car. The car isn't cheap because it isn't cheap to make. When something breaks it won't be cheap to fix it either out of warranty.

My point is... if you can't afford the 35k for a new Model 3, you probably shouldn't be looking at a used one thinking it will be a steal. The cost of ownership for these things is reasonable if you can afford the original purchase... if you're barely able to afford a used one you could be in for an unfortunate situation."
"I think 'range anxiety' is a common argument. Even now as most EVs are designed for 500km/350mi ranges, the argument continues ""what if you need to drive 1000km"".  
I'm in Australia, and we're atrocious for EV take-up. Many people seem to have a seething hate for them. I've only seen one S and one X ever. Can't wait for the right-hand-side Model 3 production to begin."
Going once!
Tax 
"Since they are still ramping up production and paying off equipment, they are only making one version now (long range with premium package, starting at 50k). Once they get production at optimal levels, they're going to start offering the other versions, including AWD and standard range battery. Probably 3-4 months away from that. "
"Big order backlog, standard model production doesn’t start until next year."
"You can't get it now for that price now.   
You can get it later for that price now.  
You can *probably* get it later for that price later.    
You can get it now (well, a short wait) for another price.   

Edit: What did I say wrong?"
"$55 a month.. that’s not bad, but still more than a months worth of gas in my ‘92 Civic, (not modded at all don’t worry lol) when gas was expensive before, and my insurance was like $40/mo. Mind you it didn’t have fancy features like..AC, power anything, a battery sometimes.. (manual, battery usually held enough juice to jump start it) I mean it was efficient as hell, it never left me completely stranded. I guess I’m an old school petrol head but the price point as far as actual travelling, was probably about the same in that thing. A 2.5hr trip to visit my mom, done in 1.5-2.0hrs, would only cost me $13 in fuel in that little 1.5L. ($55 in my Chevy blazer, $40 in my impala) 
Honestly if I had like $40-50k to spend on a car, I’d go somewhere with very little rust, buy another ‘92 civic sedan, manual everything, and restore the shit out of it like brand new. Protective coatings underneath and in engine bay/trunk. Oh some day.."
Agreed. It's a beast. 
So baller Lexus had to pay them. 
I saw him in LA. 
Then it is clearly prejudice and you should take it up with HR.
No prob.
Are you still up for C&C this Saturday?
Gulfcoast Autoshield? 
I understand some people will be responsible but there’s going to be ignorant people who will use it to get to A to B. You just can’t build an AI good enough to out weigh a human driver.
It is also a more spacious car even though its profile is smaller. But musk has said before that the model S will still remain a higher end model for all intents and purposes
"No it doesn’t. You can charge an S at home at 52 MPH. 3 tops out at 44
https://www.tesla.com/support/home-charging-installation#wall-connector"
"It’s like comparing a Camry to a 5 series. You can like the Camry more, but it’s not an upgrade"
Have you seen both in person? There’s nothing in the 3 that’s not in the S
"Awesome! So who was right? Muslims, jews, hindus??"
"The cost are high on these components today, because there is only one place to get them, in the future there will be salvaged components and rebuilders.

Batteries also will likely get a credit for the current core, the material in them is worth something and will offset some of the cost. It will take awhile for the aftermarket to catch up on these parts but it will happen.

"
"I work at a large hospital, and in one week i saw FOUR Teslas in the parking garage (doctor spaces). There were 3 S’s and an X. Since then i see the X fairly constantly, and have seen only 1 of the S’s. I drive by and just gaze longingly. 😍"
"In the northern beaches in Sydney, Teslas are everywhere"
Best I can do is tree fiddy
Tax varies by locality
"Ok that makes sense. Then again most people I talk to that want the $36K model 3 will end up getting upgrades to push the total around $50K anyways. Which is a lot of money for a car. Given what I’ve read about Tesla so far, that’s the only car outside of a Corvette(my favorite car, $55K) that I’d consider spending that kinda cash on.

in the meantime I’m going to drive my 2010 Chevy Cobalt until it’s run into the ground."
Yup. Gonna go.
"Yes. When I dropped off my car, they just finished a stealth job on a blue 3 and he let me look up close. Solid work. He does use precut, depending on the job. But on the full blue stealth, all the edges were covered."
"I mean, there are a lot of ignorant people that drive cars. and also they already HAVE built an AI that can outweigh a human driver. It’s saved me more than once from hitting parked cars or switching lanes into somebody "
"Even though I'm shocked you're saying this, I'll upvote you. No reason to downvote just because we don't agree.

That being said, I can't believe you would trust the idiots at the wheel over a computer. I can't wait for the day the insurance companies start offering huge discounts to cars with no steering wheels, and that day will be here by the time my toddler starts driving I bet.

A human driver will be seen as a liability. Once most cars are self-driving, the AI cars will all get along, all following the same rules, creating a safe and efficient traffic system. 

Throw a human in there and the unpredictableness makes it all fall apart. Every human has a different opinion on proper speeds, braking, tailgate distance, etc. We won't be outlawed, but we'll have to pay a premium one day."
"Wow, well you might want to inform Tesla that you know this for sure. They’ll be super thankful you saved them millions in R&D and years of hard work. Then, the people they’ve hired to work on related projects can just quit now and find new jobs."
"Sorry, should have clarified - I meant at a supercharger."
"I would say it’s more like a 300 series to an M6 but what the fuck do I know? Also, if you need to park in small spots, it might still be an upgrade."
Tesla is right. 
"I'd say it's likely there will be some credit on a trade in on batteries. The batteries in Tesla's are comprised of a whole shitload of 18650 cells and a portion of them will be recoverable. Something like 5% of lithium ion cells are 'recycled' nowadays. They don't actually recover the lithium either. They get some metals from melting them down but Cobalt is the only profitable part of it @ ~40$/lb


Anyway.. Nissan has a refurbished battery program in japan for the Leaf where you can pay something like 3k (instead of ~8k, these are 30kWh packs) for a refurb battery replacement... where they basically give you someone else's old pack with the dead cells removed and replaced with either fresh or batteries sourced from other old packs.

The refurbs will never be as good as a new pack, and will obviously already have some wear on them. It could be a cheaper option for people who can't afford a 15-30k battery pack, depending on whatever kWh tesla they own.... not that Tesla offers this yet. But it's certainly something I can see happening."
Locality varies by tax
"> in the meantime I’m going to drive my 2010 Chevy Cobalt until it’s run into the ground.  

Smart move  

> Which is a lot of money for a car. Given what I’ve read about Tesla so far, that’s the only car outside of a Corvette(my favorite car, $55K) that I’d consider spending that kinda cash on.  

While purchase price will always be an important metric, ""total cost of ownership"" is a bit more applicable when comparing an EV to a gas car. Depending on how much you drive, fuel type and how much electricity costs, you could be saving a couple grand a year in fuel costs with an EV, as well as less maintenance. I currently spend $2,600 on gas a year and have free charging available at work. Switching from an Acura MDX to a Model 3 as my daily driver will save me around $20k over 10 years, and that's with gas being pretty cheap currently. Also, the $7,500 US federal tax credit and any state tax credits bring down cost a ton."
"Really you can get away with the $35k option and it will probably become Tesla's best seller without the need for any upgrades. If you charge at home on a good time of use plan (your electricity company usually provides better rates during certain hours to charge), drive relatively conservatively, and get the federal/state/county tax credits you could realistically be below the $30k price point for a brand new car and save $50-150 a month on fuel which adds up over time. 5 years down the line you should be able to buy a depreciated (granted, depreciation will not be as good due to the longevity of an EV and the fuel savings) Model 3 at 75-80% of the cost which would make it a great buy at that time.

Autopilot is a fantastic upgrade for the $5k and realistically the only extra caveat here but in terms of going the financially smart route when compared to $30k class sedans, the Model 3 will become very competitive very soon.

I think my only regret about it being the best seller is they will all be black with aero wheels. Hopefully they add in other colors to the $35k price point down the line... there will be so many of them!"
Awesome! Hopefully more owners show up too.
If you trust in it too much people will be complacent. I’m sorry but it’s not possible for an AI to our perform a human
"On the Tesla site, they advertise the same 170 miles for 30 minutes at a supercharger"
"I've watched several tear down videos of the Tesla packs. I would imagine that in the future you will be able to replace an individual module if there is something wrong with it. 

The beauty of an electric car vs ICE is, at least the way I see it, it's similar to aircraft. I fly a plane that's 7 years older than me. It's dated, but you rebuild the engine frequently.

If you're in the market for a given model the values vary significantly. Many factors impact the value but one of the largest is how much time is left before a major engine rebuild. The rebuilds cost $20K-$30K. I think electric vehicle values will be similar in the future, unless the battery costs come down.

I also think that due to few moving parts in EVs they will be on the road longer as long as the body has been taken care of / no significant accidents. You replace the battery and you're good for another X years. Everyone says ""oh who can pay for the expensive new battery"", it becomes a different story when the decisions is between $10K battery of new $40K car (factoring in inflation over 10 years). With the option for additional software updates along the way, your car might have a different feel down the road in the same body. 

"
"As for the tax credit, anyone who will be reserving one right now will not get it for the Model 3. Simply because by the time they actually get their car so many Model 3's will have been sold that the credit will have been used up. "
"Cost will come down eventually, maybe not for a few years but I could see them building a 30k model.

I don’t need a premium interior, glass roof, motorized mirrors, etc. I’m talking about the equivalent of a Honda Civic or Accord. I don’t know if they will want to move down market, or if they will be need to, but the demand would probably be massive.

Edit some spelling"
Yes it is. There is proof. 
"And yes I agree, Self driving AI is definitely not ready to be available to the public. That’s why it ISNT available to the public. But AI in general is used in so many technologies and clearly works better than people, such as a chess robot or one that can solve a Rubik’s cube "
"I don't have a source offhand, but the 3 supports similar or higher power charging and it's more efficient so it gets overall faster charging. And in a shared charger / power limited situation the lower consumption also improves charging MPH."
"It will be really interesting to see what happens when the credit expires for Tesla and GM, and then foreign automakers have an advantage in the market. I could see Congress acting to put in a date-based phase out rather than total number of cars sold by automaker. As it is now, it basically (temporarily) punishes the companies that actually make popular fuel efficient cars."
I preordered 2 hours after opening reservations and i still don't think I'll get mine
That glass roof is really nice though....
But those are rudimentary. Driving requires so much attention and decision making.
"The 3 has a lower output on-board charger. That’s why the S and X can benefit from a 90 A circuit on the home charging setup, but the 3 doesn’t charge any faster. The 3 is more efficient, but it’s not that much more efficient.

Another fun one I found out from a co-worker: You can charge S and X with 277 VAC. The 3’s on-board charger doesn’t charge on it though."
"You will. It may not be the fill 7500, but you'll get some of it."
"I have no doubt it's nice, but there is always a tradeoff.  Is it $2k nice, or $5K nice. If it's $5K nice it i'm probably not interested. 

"
"my Tesla is watching the road with 8 cameras, let alone all of the supersonic sensors that surround the entire car as well as the radar sonar systems that measure traffic ahead. I’d say that’s comparable to two human eyes "
"> Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk is said to have made two new hires as the electric carmaker continues to lose high-level executives amid a structural reorganization and a myriad of headwinds.

Golly. That's the kind of juxtaposing that should only exist in the minds of the obsessive Twitter trolls. I feel like the format should be 'Tesla just added a new paint color. This comes at a time when Tesla is struggling [500 more words about how they are struggling despite paint color efforts]'

edit: Elon deleted this Tweet btw."
"My company just hired a couple interns too!  
... which is what ALL  companies do when they find an intern worth keeping!"
"Man, it sucks this cool thing that happened got turned around on Tesla in a bad manner. First and foremost, when a company is getting restructured the responsible thing is to look at the highest paid people and figure out the overlap in positions. If there's too much overlap  between those highly paid positions, you eliminate one of the positions and shift them to something else!

Second, these guys were a little special compared to other interns because not only did they solve a production bottleneck in a unique way, they literally ambushed Elon at a production meeting to share it with him. If I ambushed the CEO of my company with a Great idea that both fixes a major issue AND shows I have balls, of course they're going to get offered a job! And guess what, they're CHEAP because they're transitioning into these jobs from an internship."
"I like that Elon has been more active on twitter recently. It is unfortunate that he's been having to defend Tesla from a lot of click bait articles, but I think that it will lead Tesla into being more transparent. I think being transparent leaves a lot less room for negative speculation.

EDIT: Elon deleted this tweet. Hmmm..."
"That's fair.

I see a lot of people who effectively say that Elon needs to stop complaining about negative press because he gets so much positive exposure from the press, too. I genuinely don't understand this line of thinking.

Typically, when Tesla gets a lot of positive press, it's because they've announced or done something which seems insane or impossible. They've largely earned their positive press. And often, when they get negative press, it's because of something relatively mundane. Just because you like some press coverage you get doesn't mean you have to embrace unfair coverage.

Of course Tesla also gets a decent bit of negative coverage for failing to meet their own goals, but that's kind of their own doing, and another story altogether!"
This tweet has been deleted now. I wonder why. 
"""Breaking news: company hires smart people to do smart things."" Do I win a Pulitzer?"
Elon should take the company private.
"At first glance the news sites pumping  out clickbait articles  about Tesla is annoying. But if you think about it, it is great. It is the Trump effect. By constantly  talking about Tesla good or bad, they are building the brand recognition  that most companies  spend hundreds  of millions  of dollars to establish, FOR FREE! It's  free ~~realestate~~ advertising."
Musk should ignore the press and focus on delivering results. Get to your production targets on time and the rest will follow.
Twitter really needs to do something about all those scammers.
Did Elon delete his tweet? Can’t find it anymore.
This right here explains why Elon works 18 hours a day. Tesla is the ultimate high stakes bet. Elon has against all of the naysayers to prove wrong and to profit from. The beautiful thing is he influences a big part of the outcome.
"elon is being childish lately. felt the same way when he got mad at having to explain why profit margin on M3 went from 25 to 20%. thats a pretty significant detail.

yes the media is definitely more focused on tesla than other auto companies but it works both ways. a tesla product announcement gets way more coverage than a ford or chevy one. elon going to the MET gala gets way more coverage than another auto exec.

fact of the matter is tesla's executive turnover is pretty high lately. 

also dont accuse me of being some FUD person, i have an unhealthy amount of my capital invested in $tsla. "
"The article I saw about the hiring of the two interns was a positive article showing that they identified a problem, took the initiative, solved it, for the attention of the ceo who personally made them an offer and recognized them as problem solvers. 

Terrible coverage they get. /s"
"As /u/mrv3 points out in another thread since 2006 there have been 3 CEOs at Ford with the last still serving. 

Musk probably thought he was being really clever with his.spin of the facts.

Ford had a ceo serve for 3 years.  So yes, in a period of 4 years they had three different ceos.  The outgoing ceo, the one who served for three years, and the new ceo who is still serving. 

He would have been technically correct if he said 3 different CEOs in a period of 3 years and 2 days. 

Maybe he will try that in his next tweet.  
"
Ibrohim Ikromzoda's meme is great.
"Tesla also lost a number of high level folks that were reported. And BTW: Ford CEO changes are reported as are Ford losses of key folks. 

For example: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ford-loses-2-executives-hired-from-silicon-valley-2018-03-21

All this churn: nothing that profitability won't fix. The core issue remains that Tesla has been bad about setting and meeting expectations."
You can almost hear the sulky petulance in his voice

I think he needs to calm the hell down and not respond to every article.  He can let the results or lack there of speak for themselves.

I love this man!
Elon has driven Tesla marketing entirely through media attention and viral social media. He’s got a tough balancing act to keep the public’s attention on Tesla and also keep their impression positive. 
"This kind of stuff is not going to stop for a while.  The downside with being the new hotness is that everything you do is newsworthy.

*This just in!  Telsa CEO Elon Musk has reportedly farted in an elevator*"
Hope Elon doesn’t burn out
Hes such a douche
Tweet seemingly deleted... Anyone have a screenshot? 
"I think Elon is right in a hyperbolic sense that, ""no one even knows,"" since perhaps not many critics are using comparisons. I think though, that in a more general sense, the market (or at least, F's investors) has responded to the shuffling and struggles of Ford. 

I'm including below a history of Ford against the Dow just so we can kind of see how it has done next to some other companies. I won't include Tesla here since the timespans are so different and all I'm really trying to show is that there is some acknowledgment of Ford's situation.

**F, DJIA** | 5/16/14 | 5/16/18 | % change
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--
**Ford** | $15.76 | $11.40 | -27.6%
**Dow** | $16,491.31 | $24,768.93 | 50.19%

"
Meanwhile Ford's current CEO is pulling us out of the car business.
I love how much shit they get.  Shows how successful they are and how many haters they have.
"Unhinged. the difference is ford \*turns a profit\*. Get a grip, Musk"
I must have missed where he complained about the media covering his tweets to fix South Australia's energy crisis...
Fuck everybody hating on elon musk
I expected nothing less from US media. /s
"he's getting worse than trump

think someone needs to approve his tweets from now on"
https://i.imgur.com/zHkcFJB.jpg
"I think the craziest thing was that everyone in this sub predicted these headlines the last couple days when we learned that a couple young guys had solved an issue. 
"
why the delete? that's rare for Elon.
username weirdly checks out
"LOL, yeah, I always thought this was just a positive, feel good story. A couple of interns overperformed and got a nice job.

How this got turned into a sign of crazy company problems, I have no idea."
"Man I am seeing you everywhere recently, both on this sub and the other one.....is that you Elon? "
Legal slavery!
"Stock has several downsides.

All of these well paid talking heads have invested in standard car companies for decades, ammasing tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock.

Now Tesla comes along, even without coercion or collaboration, there is an army geared towards not liking anything Tesla does, while glazing over anything conventional companies do."
"You are thinking one level down. Be like Tesla: look for the root issue.

He's defending Tesla from Tesla's inability to set and meet expectations. The only reason there are clickbait articles is that Tesla keeps setting deadlines and not meeting them.

The fix is simple: Set some dates. Meet some dates. Instead of over promising and under delivering, under promise and over deliver.
"
Perhaps he gets all the media because he doesnt STFU. 
There's no such thing as negative publicity.
Tesla get positive press?  Really?  Can you point me to some recent positive Tesla articles?  I can point you to 500 negative ones.
"Probably because it sounded pretty dismissive about the folks he hired...referring to them as ""some interns"" sounds pretty dickish."
"Probably because it was wrong and most business media did report when the Ford CEO transitions happened.

http://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/05/22/ford-names-jim-hackett-president-and-ceo-replacing-mark-fields-after-less-than-three-years.html"
"Probably because it was inaccurate.

>CEOs of Ford Motor Company

>Jim Hackett: May 22, 2017 to present (CEO)

>Mark Fields: July 1, 2014 to May 22, 2017 (CEO)

>Alan Mulally: September 5, 2006 to July 1, 2014 (CEO)

>William Clay Ford, Jr.: October 30, 2001 to September 5, 2006"
He can't afford to. You need to buy up a majority of the shares of get a majority in a shareholder vote to take it private. 
Who would give him the $50B to do so?
"Hey, it worked for Chrysler, right? LOL"
With what money?
This makes alot of sense. I guess Elon is just leveraging all the clickbait lately. Getting more advertising out of it. 
"Agreed, there are people who are listed as verified with profiles that say they are [Elon Musk](https://news.sky.com/story/elon-musk-fakes-steal-thousands-a-day-through-twitter-11290904) linking malware who are early to comment in really high profile tweets but they don't seem to get deleted in a timely manner at all. "
Yup. Wonder why
...
"In all fairness I have never met an executive that's worth their pay. 

I remember i had this gem from back I  the day from my new VP of retail. ""So the key here is we need to sell more of X and increase our average ticket to hit our sales goals."" Oh thank you mr. executive so what you're saying is I should sell more to get higher sales? That's so profound.

Sorry just venting lol"
I’m not sure why people get upset about him Tweeting. It takes him a few seconds to tweet and it gets tens of thousands of likes. You’re talking about how Tesla gets attention. Him tweeting about this gets Tesla even more attention. 
People have been predicting Tesla's death since it's inception. Must be starting to annoy him. 
Are you saying that Ford losing 3 CEOs in 4 years gets the same attention as Tesla?
"What he wrote was fake news, Fords last 3 CEOs were over a 12 year span - he can’t complain about it if he does the exact same thing."
It probably takes him a few seconds to tweet that and it gets rid of some of the fog.
Take something you're passionate about and are working endlessly to make happen then have a bunch of idiots shit on it. It's hard to calm down.
Good Bot
And just like trump he posts bullshit - only Elon has the self respect to delete his tweet when he finds out its horseshit. 
"Surprise surprise, another one from t_d.  The overlap there is throwing up an awful lot of red flags."
Fake news = negative news?

"Is kind of crazy they turn a profit and it’s only $11/share. Can anyone explain that, I honestly don’t understand how it can be so low."
Downvotes because it's true.

A lone person/people solving a major issue isn't just a Tesla thing either.  When I was younger I fixed a major bottleneck in an automotive production line by coming in at 4am and recording the exact datetime every time a sensor tripped.  Within 15 minutes I was able to find exactly the problem and what to change in the PLC to fix our major production headaches.  The result was millions in savings and the fact that we were no longer at the point of shutting down a T1 customer.
"The more obsessive folks I'd say this kind of thing is deliberate, but for the media I tend to blame laziness. They got to write a certain amount and they are lazy, so they take the news item and then just combine it with whatever other recent news items pop into their head first. I think that's how the human mind works. This stuff goes away on its own if the news flow coming out of Tesla naturally improves. Then it will magically look like hiring interns and Tesla's production success are linked more than they should be."
"It came off as derogatory to the interns, they don't deserve to be used like that."
"Probably because he released how misleading it is.

Since 2006, Ford has had 3 CEOs, including the one that is currently serving.

The second CEO served for 3 years, so yes, in a period of 4 years (actually 3 years and 2 days) they had 4 different CEOs, the outgoing one, the one that served for 3 years and the current CEO)


"
"Probably more indication that Tesla is going under, amirite?"
A majority of internships are paid though...
"Never said they were unpaid interns, which I agree is totally unacceptable. Interns at my Fortune 100 company make the same salary they would if they were full time employees, minus the benefits bc it is usually just for three or so months."
Or very well paid...?
">The only reason

That is one of the reasons. Tesla isn't the most shorted stock on the market \(simply\) because they don't meet their idealistic timelines. The shorts write plenty of clickbait articles."
"> The only reason there are clickbait articles is that Tesla keeps setting deadlines and not meeting them.

The alternative is setting deadlines far into the future and always pushing the deadline back.  There is a joke that says any feature that is 5 years away will always be 5 years away.

Part of the reason elon's companies move so fast is because of the agressive deadlines.    Moving fast is pretty much the worth of his companies.  Its how they compete."
[deleted]
"> The only reason there are clickbait articles is that

Total bollocks. The reason is that anything ""Musk"" gets clicks, good or bad or interesting or boring."
"There are different ways of thinking. 

Most of the best tech companies set very lofty goals (admittedly mostly internally). They quite often fail meeting these goals. The mindset behind it is that if you set sky high goals, even if you fall short you will have achieved more the setting an easily attained goal and aiming for that. 

Also understand that Elon’s strategy I’d imagine would be to weed out day traders and the like and would prefer shareholders that share long term vision over the short sited get rush quick on stocks crowd. 

It is a long battle. And a battle that has unfortunately has a lot of very powerful people who would likely not want Tesla to succeed. "
this is absolutely false and i hate how it keeps getting parroted.
"Just because Tesla articles have largely been negative lately doesn't mean Tesla never gets positive press. I remember a lot of excitement around the Tesla Semi and Roadster late last year. The Powerpack got a decent bit of positive attention in the last year (particularly when you consider that it's really just a bunch of batteries) from deployments in Puerto Rico and Australia, as well. Oh, also, a lot of people have had good things to say about the Model 3. Does that count?

Lately there hasn't been a lot of positive coverage, which is probably because the most positive spin is ""We're really close to where we wanted to be 6 months ago, but our customers are being super patient."" That could change overnight if Tesla announced that they hit a production target ahead of schedule. Fingers crossed?"
"The battery project in Belgium is a good example. Many large news outlets covered it in a positive way and acted like its never been done bevore.  
Almost everyone forgot that there are already  several large batteries in Europe. Or have you ever heard about the big battery that smart built?  
Heck even the unveiling of the model 3 was worldwide news Everytime someone reserves a Tesla semi it's on the frontpage. "
"Sure, the articles about the interns that Elon is complaining about:

https://electrek.co/2018/05/16/tesla-hires-canadian-interns-as-professional-problem-solvers-elon-musk/

https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-tesla-interns-helped-model-3-production/

http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/elon-musk-tesla-newfoundland-interns-hired-1.4663270"
lol...tesla has Teslarati and Electrek shilling them 24/7...thats Tesla's Fox and Friends. Also that dumb plane stunt has been floating around a lot lately. Also negative ones are news...like fiery deaths and nascent tech potentially having critical failure 
"That obviously wasn't his intention though, he's saying having a new CEO is far more newsworthy than hiring a few interns."
"What you provided proves it was accurate? 

2013-2017 had 3 different CEOs. "
"Elon + 4 largest institutional investors already own more than 50% of the company. If he picks up the phone today he can have enough support to do it within 3 months. 

If this fails start talking to Google, Softbank, Tencent, etc. World is full of cheap money waiting for the right investment."
the whole point of a public company is to allow for quick expansion. that's why spacex is private and tesla is public. spacex employees really wanted it to go public so they can get rich but elon won't do it and he explained it in a company wide letter. so he would never buy tesla up.
Bezos
Nobody. 
"This has been happening for months too, and the sad thing is that it would not be difficult for twitter to prevent this. I can think of a few simple ways they could do this but I have no clue why they don't.

* Don't replies from new accounts right under high profile twitter accounts
* Don't show replies from accounts that have the same profile picture as the original tweeter until verified. 
* Hide replies that contain a wallet address until verified its a legit use.


"
"Because he knowingly fudged the numbers whilst remaining technically correct and it looks bad - it’s not normal to quote the last year of the tenure of the 3 people you’re looking at - it’s disingenuous and when people point it out it shows he is manipulating data - just like all the shitty articles that musk hates on. 

Ford has had 3 CEOs in a 12 years span - even if the ceo before this one only stayed two years, the one before that stayed 10. It’s weird to take the day the dude left as the cutoff for the time period yours looking at. 

“The USA has gone through 2 presidents in 2 years” is technically correct - but conveys a different picture to reality. 

You can’t just arbitrarily start a datapoint on whatever date you want and then talk shit, make you look deceitful. 
"
"It's likely bringing in clicks to fox business, which means more revenue."
"He probably doesn't work 18 hours every day, but he works a lot. You can work a lot of hours and tweet occasionally. Tweeting is not a time draining task..."
I def agree.  It's just friends getting friends rich under the guise of meritocracy.
"no, im talking about his attitude lately.

he's being super defensive/standoff-ish lately. one example along with the ones i mentioned above is getting super mad about any criticism of AP. to argue that safest car on the road thing when theres no legit science to back it up makes him look bad. same with his other out lashes lately.

someone that doesnt believe in elon as much as me would say he's going off the deep end lately. "
Yeah. Everybody poops and he's good at multitasking.
The point is that Ford has a deeper bench and is not on the verge of either huge success or failure. 
"I think I'm saying:

> The core issue remains that Tesla has been bad about setting and meeting expectations.

Tesla press will get a lot calmer if the company can say something 9 months in advance and then deliver it 9 months later.

I'm also saying that key people leaving companies is news. It is reported for Tesla. It is reported for other car companies. "
"To clarify, they didn't lose 3 CEOs in 4 years. They lost 1 CEO in 4 years; Elon was counting the CEO going into those 4 years (who started in 2006) and the CEO coming out of those 4 years (who is coming up on his 1 year anniversary)."
"See this is the bullshit I hate here - ford hasn’t “lost 3 ceos in 4 years”

Alan Mulally stayed for 8 years till 2016
Mark Fields stayed for 3 years till 2017
Jim Hackett hasn’t left and stayed in 2017

So you read one bullshit tweet by musk and decided you knew everything about Ford - the same shit you people complain about every fucking day in regards to the media about tesla. 

The only slightly unusual thing here is the shortness of Mark Fields length of service - but from what I can tell he made some dodgy decision about cancelling a new factory in mexico and pissed if the board so he was replaced.

"Even if he is, shaming him and shooing him away isn't going to make him change his political opinion. It will make him think less of anyone who doesn't like Trump and further entrench him in his bubble.

You'll catch more flies with honey than vinegar. Show him respect, listen to what he has to say, and if you want to change his mind, don't be hostile about it. If you want to change his mind, you want to help him, not harm him."

Ford family owns all of the shares that really matter. 
"Share price is a bit arbitrary without considering the total number of shares out there.  Ford has had several stock splits in the past.  Tesla's market cap is slightly higher, though."

"Downvote because Ford had over a hundred year head start?  You know that many years Amazon didn't turn a profit and to this day had barely made anything?

""Shipping Model 3 in summer of 2017."" I'm here to tell you that releasing 50 cars to employees is not spiking the ball on shipping model 3 in summer of 2017.

Self driving car coast to coat by end of 2017? Speaks for itself.

"It is not false the tiniest bit, reach is more important than what is being said. "
"The battery pack in Australia gets pretty much nothing *but* good press - and the exceptions are usually Liberals complaining about it supposedly driving up electricity costs - most of which have petered off because it’s slashed the cost of the load balancing and frequency control  services, which are its primary services.

"If gas car fires aren't news, then tesla fires aren't news either, especially if the chances of a gas car fire is still 5x as likely as a tesla fire..."
"Not only did the Ford CEO changes actually make the news (Elon should probably google once in a while), but what was newsworthy about the original story is that these particular interns used their ingenuity and confidence to come up with production improvements and directly present them to Elon. The original CBC article was very positive, but apparently Elon just heard about Fox's badly rehashed version."
The way it sounds is that they have burned through CEOs really quick when in reality they are on their 3 CEO in 12 years with the current CEO is just now about to hit his 1-year mark.
"Ironically, the best way to take the company private is to let the short sellers run wild.  They want to drive the price of stocks down, and someone wanting to take a company private wants low stock prices.

"Honestly, none of them would want it. And they'd need 100% of shares because banks aren't going to loan them the rest.

He'd also have to burn through cash reserves to do it.  I think he'd rather use them to continue ramping up the company.

"LOL, I don't think they're that close.  Bezos sued SpaceX claiming ownership of the idea of vertically landing a rocket on a boat like SpaceX has been doing forever...  I'm glad Bezos finally reached the technical definition of space with his company's space efforts, but he still isn't doing what he sued Tesla for doing.

I hope his company becomes a massive threat to SpaceX though, if they put up enough payloads and a competing global satellite internet, everybody wins except Comcast."
"Not to mention that I am sure there are employees at Twitter that follow Elon that see these fake accounts and should be able to police them quickly. Maybe there are things that not all Twitter employees should be permitted to police without escalation but an obvious fake account slinging cryptobullshit should be in the ""act now and request forgiveness later"" category. Or at least the account is hidden from view until someone else from twitter can validate the act.

Maybe not all Twitter employees should have access to suppress the [US president](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/11/02/trumps-twitter-account-was-temporarily-deactivated-due-to-human-error) but they should have permission to squash obvious impersonators pushing malware.

Reddit has mostly volunteers helping police content and for some accounts their AI gives a low trustworthiness rating even volunteers or other twitter users should be able to hide their posts pending employee review. "
">You can’t just arbitrarily start a datapoint on whatever date you want and then talk shit, make you look deceitful.

Oh you mean like what the linked article did? It is painting a picture that Tesla just hires random interns because they have high executives leaving. The interns coming on board have nothing to do with the executives leaving."
"Every business owner will tell you that being reactive to shitty articles is a waste of time.

"You have to expect this attitude when a lot of people are betting on you failing so they can profit. Regarding the AI criticism, he said it needs to be better and they work to improve it every day (https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/996133894893129728?s=21). 

I see where you’re coming from, but everyone has their opinions on this type of behavior. I personally don’t mind since they’re not taking too much of his time and people tend to love it (tens of thousands of likes within hours). 

I guess none of this truly matters. What matters is if Tesla can produce more model 3s, make a profit, and magnificently improve autopilot. People will tend to forget about these “childish” tweets once Tesla starts delivering honestly. "

At the end of the first day they finished on time (first time ever).  Everyone was congratulating the supervision for a job well done.  I went back to my desk in the hallway.
Atta boy!

"why? Tesla is a low volume vehicle which is in an industry with a small sample size. If an automotive product has an issue/recall it is is usually reported. If an EV has an issue/fire/recall, it is gets a lot of coverage because its in a brand new industry so there is much more interest and speculation over it. Finally, if the ""SAFEST CAR EVER"" catches fire...then yes it deserves all the attention it gets.

I think that's exactly the point. The way it sounds. Just like Tesla clickbait articles.
">  They want to drive the price of stocks down, and someone wanting to take a company private wants low stock prices.

[The Hudsucker Proxy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wImfCx4bDFc) is such a good film, just thought I'd toss that out there in case anyone hasn't seen it yet. "
I have a question: what happens to the shorts should a company go private?
"Bezos still has him on the one-click patent for launching a rocket, though."
Woosh!
Satellite internet sucks. 
"> ""act now and request forgiveness later""

That is a great point, especially when these bots are days old. 

Any social network has the risk of unintentionally suppressing real users when trying to combat spam and abuse, so they need to decide if that is something they want to risk to prevent these scams."
"You can’t do the same and then complain about what they did - and you can’t point out flaws in the article without holding musk to those same standards either. His tweet should have pointed that out - not used the same method to try and make a similar point. Musk was wrong and better than that and that’s why the tweet is gone. 


"
"and i firmly believe they will make massive amount of profits from the M3. AP i'm less sure of, but still decently confident that TSLA will at least double by 2020."
If they would actually release a FSD car that only causes less fatalities than a normal average driver then Tesla would be sued to the ground. He's ridiculous.
I expect they'll have an *interesting* future ahead of them as they increase their already bad fleet MPG by no longer selling cars.  This is good for Tesla and other heavy EV invested companies that have a surplus of emissions credits to sell them.  
"That's not accurate. Public projections/production targets are not arbitrary, are revised frequently by Tesla, and Tesla misses its projections pretty much every single time.

This isn't to say that I dislike Tesla or that I think they're a bad company, but its inaccurate to say that they only miss internal goals."
"Er...yeah. Whoops.

It is worth pointing out, though, that the first guy (Mulally) had publicly said in 2012 that he would stay until 2014, but probably retire then. So it's not like his departure was unexpected or anything (his successor, on the other hand, was essentially ousted)."
I was gonna go with the same example but went with Tesla’s instead - at one point near the beginning tesla had 4 in 2 years - I didn’t can’t find any reference to musk calling out that period of uncertainty specifically when they were looking for venture capital funding. 
"It's legit though, but it doesn't really have an agenda.  Media is sensationally and click baitey.  And can seem biased to you if you only focus on what they say about you.

But FYI, there are definitely people with some kind of self interest making hit pieces and trying to tear down Elon.  I've read a half dozen SpaceX ""technically true but misleading as hell"" articles and a few Tesla."
"Actually third largest by landmass, behind the US.  Canada is second largest by area (we have more water)."

It’s a Quebec and Newfoundland rivalry thing.  Since Canada offered Newfoundland a big chunk of Quebec’s territory (Labrador) in exchange to have them join the confederation.  Quebec has been calling them newfies and insulting them in jokes since then.

"It's reasonable that investors pay attention to the big picture financial items. ""We are selling Model S's and Model X's and we are also burning cash like crazy because we are going to be producing 5000 Model 3's per week by the end of 2017"" ... it's clear what the dominant term is.

They need to make some predictions about things that matter to their long term financial health and then they need to meet those predictions.

Sales predictions when their key product is dragging down cash on hand are not going to move the needle.

... edit ...

There's a soft landing here where they become a boutique company who sets and meets their quarterly sales targets for the S, the X and the coming Roadster. They aspire to more than that. Good for them -- but they need to get better at it."
"Why should its newness or low-volume status matter?

If Volkswagon came out with a car it advertised as safer and indeed was 80% less likely to catch on fire, and then one caught on fire, should the news be a breathless ""Another VW Asbesto catches on fire, causing concern that the new VW Fire-Safe technology is unsafe!!"" or should it be ""VW Asbesto has 20% as many fires per mile compared to other comparable cars.""?

> Finally, if the ""SAFEST CAR EVER"" catches fire...then yes it deserves all the attention it gets.

Not if it still catches on fire much less often than other cars, and is still the safest car ever. "
no. the point isnt to trash ford. the point is pointing out that ford had 3 ceos in 4 years but it doesnt make the news. 
"Someone still owns those shares that are being shorted, the shorts are just borrowing them. But usually when a stock is bought out or goes private it's at big premium to the existing price so short sellers lose their ass normally."

What's this?
You haven't heard about low latency LEO constellations then... 
"Currently it does. SpaceX's planned low orbit constellation will have lower latencies than transcontinental connections; this will be their initial market. They will be competitive for consumers as they complete their constellation with speeds up to gigabit and latencies around 25 to 35 ms.

***Distant*** satellite internet sucks.  LEO Satellite internet is being launched by multiple companies (SpaceX already has more ISP satellites than Sirius does for their satellite radio) because it's both fast and low latency.  The satellites are much closer.
"Yeah I think they can categorize users and the permissions needed to suppress a verified several year old account with thousands of followers are not the same as the permissions needed to flag a couple day old account the AI has assigned a low trust score to.

Bad actors could do tings like create accounts in bulk in advance and use them later but the score would weigh a handful of factors. 

Ultimately the permissions would follow a scale and brand new accounts could be moderated by just other more senior/established twitter users forcing scammers to have to create accounts in advance and pretend to be a normal user to establish some trust before using the account for malware. 

It for sure raises the amount of work they have to do and sudden drastic changes to the twitter account would trigger a temp lower trust probation period to fight that.

It's much like how brand new and low karma reddit users mostly start out in the dog house. 

These accounts should have a low enough trust score that even when you or I see them a couple user reports automatically hide them from view until a dedicated moderator approves them. 

If the things we flag get overturned my moderators we lose the right to continue doing it and if the things we flag are consistently confirmed as accurate we get more ""vote points"" and it takes fewer of us to flag it before it's hidden from view. 

Components of this are already in place on a lot of other social media platforms and it would prevent them from having to hire an army of people to read and moderate every single tweet as soon as it's sent."

"> Musk was wrong and better than that

No, he obviously isn't better than that. He is Trumpian."
"> That's not accurate.

It's exactly what Musk has reiterated numerous times on earnings calls.

> Public projections/production targets are not arbitrary, are revised frequently by Tesla, and Tesla misses its projections pretty much every single time.

Musk has said exactly that in those very same calls as a disclaimer every time.

He has literally stated how they/he uses these production projections in that way. Have you not listened to the earnings calls at all?"
"Nope.  Russia is #1, then Canada, then the US.  Check yo' figures."
Actually fourth largest by landmass. China is #2 by landmass
"That's not really what happened. Quebec and Newfoundland were disputing the border way before they joined the confederation. The UK courts settled the matter in 1927.
What happened when Newfoundland joined the confederation was just to confirm that the court decision was agreed on both sides. They didn't just offer a bunch of land to make them join the country.

Yes it would get a ton of press especially if it was toted as safer and less likely to catch on fire because it would not be living up to its promised reliability. 

Also false. https://www.cheatsheet.com/automobiles/the-7-automobiles-with-spotless-driver-safety-records.html/?a=viewall

Here's 10 vehicles with perfect safety records with 0 fatalities. Spoiler: Tesla isnt on there. Neither is it on the IIHS top safety picks for 2018. Also before you recycle Elons skewed NHTSA quote, that compares Tesla to all vehicles with an average age of 11.6 years (credit @Hoonable aka Bozi) along with motorcycles, etc. So no it is not 4x safer or the safest car ever. 

So slog the media all you want and I'll admit some articles are a bit far reaching, but the accidents are real and concerning. Production rates are concerns. Financial health is a concern. Elon's behavior is a concern. These individually would may barely scratch front page, but ""boneheaded questions"" has placed Tesla and Elon under a microscope. Finally, you can't be angry about coverage and then try to trash a competitor in your reply (Ford). It's classless and simply childish. If he can't control himself, he should hire someone to manage his social media. It's the role of journalists to discover and report on the company. This isn't a conspiracy created by the ""shorts"" or ""big oil"" to bring down the company. Regardless of what bias or propangda you feel they are reporting, the facts speak for themselves. "

"Yes.  Very detailed, but as you’ve read, this case has been debated over british court for almost a century, and:

""A 1971 Québec royal commission decided that Québec's case against the 1927 boundary was not worth pursuing; by 1987, although the province did not consider the issue to be settled, the dispute appeared to be dormant.""

Is pretty much a statement of Quebec saying: ""We ‘re not satisfied, but it seems we can’t win this"".
The french colonist once occupied most of the east coast up to Louisiana, and New Orlean.  British ""invasion"" , america’s independence, british retreating to Canada, abandonnent by France, rendered Quebec powerless, and was then controlled by the British up to the creation of the Confederation.
Of course the court ruled against them."

Cost:
$3,200 for wrap + $800 for tints
He included doing the center as part of a package deal. 

For South Florida the average price was around $2,800 for the wrap alone, but this place does a ton of Tesla’s and had already worked on a bunch of 3s so felt more confident going there for a little extra money. 

And it’s not easy tinting that huge back window. Lots of people don’t even do it or do it in two pieces instead of one big sheet of tint like I got."
Please mark this NSFW. Thank you.
How long does this last OP?
"whoa yeah, looks great! what are your thoughts about chrome deleting?"
This is awesome! Can you take it through a normal touchless car wash or do you have to be careful not to use high pressure water when washing it? I really want to get a matte black wrap but I'm afraid of how hard it will be to keep clean cause I often park outside.

"What are your thoughts on de-chroming? Or otherwise known as the ""black pack* in some places. I think it's work great with this colour."
"Gorgeous.  Great job.

I'll echo everyone else: the chrome-delete would look outstanding.    Matching the chrome pieces with a gloss-black to your window tint might look interesting, but there's a lot to be said about keeping everything matte-black.  On the topic of your window tint, also a great choice.  Sure, it's practical in Florida... but damn does it look good, too ;).  Keep those aero wheels on; they look incredible.  I much prefer them to all other offerings.  "
Good luck keeping it clean haha

Subbed for someone one-upping OP and getting vantablack wrap and tints.
Stupid question (Im getting my 3 in a couple weeks) what is wrapping and why do people do it?
Eugh
You’ll get gold if you add the first 100 digits of pi to it.
So... Duct Tape makes it a better car?
"Dudeee i saw this on the road a few days ago! So nice, I’m jealous lol"
Has this been in Gainesville recently? 
Looks great! What tint % did you use?
Will you be parking this in the Batcave?
Should have done a chrome delete too! There's plenty of YouTube videos about it and will change the look completely!!
"Perfect. I’m new to south Florida so I’ve been worried where I will get mine done when my model 3 comes. Definitely saving this site. 

Thanks man. Looks great!"
So sexy 
Holy sexy that looks gorgeous...
sexy
"Man, that looks great.   I always wondered about the protective properties of wrapping a car.   "
I love matte
Beautiful 
Looks great IMO! Any plans to upgrade the wheels?
Looks shit lol
Do you know if the shop removed the bumpers to wrap?  Any impact on the sensors / AP?
Thinking of getting a wrap. How long do they typically last? What is the wash procedure?
Why not velvet? 
Was that to cover up the mismatched paint?
It looks like u downgraded ur textures 
It looks really good! Now it's time to upgrade those rims.

Does anyone think a [multicolor](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/8myxh0/skittles_chroma/?st=JHSSQPZR&sh=1494cc99)  wrap would look good on the 3?  Would it work on top of black?

"You’ve made your car look less luxurious and more childish, great job."

South Florida + Flat black... I'm all for individuality but that's going to be an experiment in the AC system.
Looks awesome. I’m doing mine in the satin perfect blue. Glad to to see people wrapping their cars. You got a pretty good deal.  
Matte Black in S. FL? That car is now a boiler
$800 for tints???? That’s outrageous
Anyone interested in attempting a DIY of the center console you can use the open source template found [here](https://github.com/Kenrik/Model-3-Vinyl-Wrap-Template) You'll need aprox 3sq/ft of material which will run you around $15 (for 5sq/ft) on Amazon. My recommendation for Matte Black is Avery 900 Series automotive wrap as it's more durable and resistant to scuffs and scratches than the 3M 1080 Matte. I also have full kits available on Amazon if you don't have access to a vinyl plotter.
That’s what a wrap should cost. Anyone quoting less is new and less experienced.
Good lord that's sexy as hell.
"I am not a fan of those wheels, with that wrap. "
"$3200 is not bad considering if you get the black model 3 and save $1k, then you only paid $2.2k for black matte. I just wish it would last as long as factory paint."

holy crap.... "
"Piano black interior bits are silly, good call on the console wrap."
Any chance you could try to get a pic of the entire dash? I’m digging the look and want to know how the combo on the interior looks. 
"That video looks like AR. 

I have a question, since I've never touched a wrapped car. Does it feel like metal to the touch, or plastic? I guess it would be cold but metal has a certain feel right? Curious. "
"You're allowed to tint your front window? Not legal in Europe unless it's stock and then they only allow I dunno maybe 15&#37;?

Car looks awesome. Matte wrap will definitely be the thing to do when I get one."
How much did everything cost including the car?
"Are you saying you got the windshield tinted? Is that even legal in FL? I know it's not in NV.

As a GenXer, the matte look never works for me. Grew up around too many rattle canned primered vehicles to think that it ever looks like anything other than unfinished. 

The matte dash panel works well. I'm not a big fan of reflective surfaces inside vehicles. The dash top of my '13 Chevy p/u truck glares the fuck out of me, I had to dash mat, it was more annoying than having to put a rug on it."
🤣 I thought about
It def made me cumb
"3 years is the average or what people say, but I’m aiming to take care of it well and get 4-5 years out of it hopefully. Probably depends on how much you drive, if you garage or cover it, how much sun you get, etc. "
"I almost did it, but I actually like the contrast and saved me a few bucks.  But the total stealth look is great too."
Pretty sure it’s recommended hand wash only. You can probably take it through a touch-less every once in a while though.  Still have to read pamphlet. 🤣
"Thanks! Seems the majority like it, but I’m not that surprised about the negativity since this is The Internet. "

"For sure. I *hate* these wheels. For me, they totally ruin the look of the car."
"C’mon, you know you like it!"
"LOL, not sure what you mean by sock case? 
I was a big fan of the initial model 3 reveal matte black wrap and had to do it myself. Also, I’ve loved matte black for at least 20 years.  Even though it’s “in” now I don’t care. "

"Glad you can apperatie it! Most people that don't like matte have been hating on this post, so thanks for your comment. "
"Yeah, I think even if someone doesn't like a Matte Black car overall, for the center console it looks much cleaner than the piano black."
I bought the lug nut cover wheel kit for $35 before I got the car and now I’m not sure I want to use it LOL. 
Thanks! I have (had LOL?) good credit so got a 0% APR for 15 months credit card. Makes it hurt less. 
"Thought about it, might still do it in the future. Based on some comments here if I do it, will probably be a black, but the satin or something slightly shinier than the matte black so I still have some contrast, but it’s all black. Just going to enjoy it for now and have a future update to look forward to a few months or so down the line. "
"Thanks! I think that’s one of the main reasons I decided to wait on chrome delete.  I was unsure if I wanted to go stealth mode with deep matte on deep matte or something different.  Also, money. Once I pay down this credit card bill I’ll start looking at options again. 

On aero, going to keep it like this for a bit, then will try the aero cap kit since I already bought it just to compare, but I feel like I’m going to come back to the covers. "
"Yes, it will be interesting, but who are we kidding...this is the first car I’ve ever owned with 5 miles on it when I bought it (others had 10k plus). I would be cleaning this thing at least 4 times a month anyway. "

"I did it because I’ve always wanted a matte black car. That’s known as a full color change wrap. 

Some people do it just to protect the factory paint underneath. There are clear wraps that UV protect and put a layer between the environment and paint. "

Now I have something to look forward too, enjoy this for a bit and then add that a few months down the line. "

"Me too! I’ve always wanted to have a matte car, just never had a car worth wrapping till now. "
Thanks! 😎
"Thanks! Probably not on the wheels, because money.  But I do like the aero covers more in person than I did from any picture I saw. I also got the aero cap kit, so I may give those a try to mix it up at some point. "

No.

Thanks! I really like how it came out. 
Thanks! I’m really happy with how it came out.

Thanks! I love getting in the car even more now. 
"Might do chrome delete in the future. Probably a slightly shinier (3M satin) black, so I still have some contrast, but more stealth. "

Thanks! It really is 😁
I believe you meant WTF *are* tints. 
Sometimes as I walk up to the car I can’t believe it’s mine (and also the bank’s) matte black model 3!
"Depends on darkness (% of light through) and the state. These are the rules for Florida. 
https://www.tinting-laws.com/florida/"
It doesnt.
"> What is about tint in USA? Doesn’t it prohibited?

US laws vary by state.  Most states *do* have tint laws, but *usually* they are not heavily enforced and only induce cheap fines ($50-$100 +/-).  I'm happy to pay $300/year in tint fines to keep my windows black because I live in a very hot state.  "
Not sure what that is. Not sure I want to look now and have buyers remorse. 
"Sorry to disappoint, but look at the bright side...at least it’s not your car. "
"Yeah, I should have included that. Just edited my main comment with that info. "
"LOL, someone else a few comments down said the same thing. That’s why I got the fancy 3M crystalline tint. Plus, the LTE connected car lets me flip on the AC 5 mins before getting in and it’s nice and cool. "
How much are you looking at for yours? What city / area? For a place that has worked on 3s and tons of S and X I felt it was a great price. 
Agree. Xpel stealth is 4.5K in northeast nj
"It was already black, so not sure it makes much of a difference. Plus, I got the fancy tints so should stay cool inside. And one of my favorite things with an LTE connected car, I can turn on the AC 5 mins before getting in and it’s perfect!"
"I thought so too, at first. But I got 3M crystalline which is expensive. Plus, to do the model 3 back window you need a large roll of tint that most places don’t have so they do it in two pieces which can look bad with a seam. "
"Yeah, it sucks because laws could change and OP might have to remove it in the future. I'd totally recommend OP getting a restriction on his licenses for the tints. "
"I thought I wouldn’t like the aero covers, but in person they look better and I think the wrap makes them look even better. I did buy the aero cap kit already, so may try the rims underneath which are like a flat gray.  "
"That’s what I told my wife. Yes, would be nice if it lasted longer, but matte paint is apparently really expensive. Like 10k expensive. "
[https://imgur.com/a/mJgkdLu](https://imgur.com/a/mJgkdLu)
Yeah. I’ll snap one soon. But the matte center with the matte looking factory wood does work well in my opinion. 
"Hmm, since it’s on a hard surface it doesn’t feel soft, but definitely does feel more like vinyl than a regular paint job. But it doesn’t feel bad at all. "
You meant 85%? At least in US when you talk about tint it’s how much light gets through. Lower number is a darker tint. My windshield is 70%. You can barely tell. I’m sure 90% of people (maybe more) wouldn’t even know. 
"In South Korea they have heavy tint on their front window, coming from Europe that was really weird. As I have a rule only to cross the road after making eye contact with the driver. No chance of that there.

As a gamer, the cars there felt like NPC's lol"
"I added the EAP to the car, so that’s 55k plus tax with the 1k delivery. Then as I put in my main comment, this stuff was 4k. Then I get the $7,500 tax credit. A lot of money, but that’s why I worked to get my credit score up for good rate on my car loan and credit cards. "
"Not sure if it’s legal here, but it should be with the sun and heat! At 70% it’s not super noticeable and really cuts down on glare and heat. "
"Legal in FL up and down to a point. If you leave the state, they will write you a dozen tickets, especially NY."
"Ceramic coat the wrap, it will prevent UV damage and extend the life of it.  Pro Tip:  Avoid ceramic pro if you like your money."
Thank you.
"Good wraps should last 7 years minimum.

Avery Dennison is a good brand who have a long guarantee on their higher end products which are well worth the price."
"How (and by whom) is it removed afterwards? What about the console wrap?

Beautiful job. I saw a matte black model S a few years ago and I still can't get it out of my mind. Your post is renewing my fervor"
Gloss black chrome delete with the matte wrap looks killer. 
"It needs..... actually no, it looks awesome as it is. Congratulations. "
"I don’t normally like chrome trim, but on this black matte, I think it’s a great compliment. Keeps looking classy instead of total black out."

OP with some funnies! Car looks great man! I got the black paint but don't think the cost justifies it for me...yet.
Expensive.  But it really looks good!

Thanks XD
thats what i thought...but why pay 3K to protect the paint? I didnt think it was that expensive to paint a car....
You mentioned South Florida and I remember seeing a Model 3 exactly like this in Tampa this past Monday. So unless someone has another one exactly like this then it must’ve been you lol
But what counts is that you like it m8 
"Wondering because I have seen many high end places remove all components like headlights, bumpers, door handles, etc.
"
"Does it preserve the paint underneath? If so, this would be a major selling point."
How did you name yours? 
"I just want to comment on how active you are on responding to comments. Great post, great poster. "
"Yeah. It really comes down to personal taste I think. I actually have the aero cover kit, but haven’t tried it yet since the covers look so good with the wrap. I’m sure I’d like it either way.  I’ll give the cover kit a try next month. "
Thanks! 
You are too :)
"Thanks. Found [all states list](https://www.raynofilm.com/blog/automotive-window-tint-laws-by-state). 
So you can’t visit state with stronger rules?"
Agreed
"[Vantablck](https://youtu.be/EP0rH8IR22c) is a special coating that absorbs 99% of light and can make feature of the object because unable to be seen. The thing is it takes a special application process to be applied and can't really be put on to everything, also i believe it can be damaged easily so isn't great for things like this"
You do you man. I'm just interested in the durability of the wrap. 3m knows their stuff but I feel like Miami and Las Vegas are the two places where outdoor products really get pushed to the limit.
"I paid close to what you paid. But I’m doing a lot more. Black turbine wheels, chrome delete, and I definitely want to do the center console like you. It’s so much better that way. "
"Oh yeah, I forgot about that feature. Well then, go ahead looking amazing and staying cool!"
[deleted]
Wow! It really does look good! Everything matches so well. I knew it would look good judging by your color and tint choices on the exterior. Looks great. Have fun saving the world! 
Thanks for your reply!
"Funny how that works. In Europe it‘s the other way around, how much gets filtered.

And that other crap is Reddit‘s new shiny editor."
I met a guy who drove a lot for work. He got mileage and fuel allowance from work. That allowed him to make the payments on a Tesla.
"Yeah my cousin in Vegas had the windshield of his truck done with 80 and with the rest in 20 or so, you definitely couldn't tell. But it's illegal in NV for sure, although we can do front side windows which many states you can't.

He loved it, didn't feel like he had to rock sunglasses with which dark side windows he felt impacted his ability to see too much."
"This is 3M, but with South Florida sun not sure how it will hold up yet. Guess it can’t really get dull and faded through can it? "
"I’m guessing it’s probably safer to have it removed by a wrap shop versus just peeling it off yourself. They can heat it up and take it off carefully to not mess up paint underneath. Although, since I put this on within a couple weeks of getting it, it should come off without issue versus wrapping an older vehicle with worn paint. 

I linked this in my main comment (can’t post text with an image post unfortunately) so you can see some other angles and inside. 

https://m.imgur.com/a/jX8DVm0
"
"Easy, get a hair dryer and do it yourself heat it up the slowly peal it off.

If not any sign maker will do it. Unless the paintjob is shit underneath it won't come off."
"I’ve seen pictures of that. That’s probably what I’ll do if I decide to add that later. Gives that nice contrast, but all black. "
"Haha. My thoughts exactly. I went back and forth. After I was like...yeah, I like this. "
r/beetlejuicing
The setup was too good to not respond! 🤣
I get that. I got a new 0% APR for 15 month credit card to make this happen. I’ve been wanting to go matte black like this since the late 90s. Never had a car worth doing this too before. This is my first new car ever. 
"For South Florida it wasn’t that crazy of a price. I got a bunch of quotes and most people didn’t even know about the model 3. The cheapest wrap was $2,000 the most expensive was $3,500. Average  was $2,800.  Tints are hard to compare because most places don’t use 3M crystalline and don’t do full back window in one piece. "
"#F O U R T H O U S A N D D O L L A R S

"
720 is good; anything over 800 is stellar. 
800+ is where I’m at. But anything 740 or more is considered good out of 850 max. 
"A good paint job will cost more than this. You can definitely get it painted cheaper, but also wrapped cheaper too. Plus, I’m pretty sure a matte black paint job is even more expensive than the average color. 

Not sure I would have paid to just protect the paint alone, for me that’s secondary to getting the color change. "
"Nope, just east coast so far. But someone else did comment here yesterday about a nice matte black 3 in Tampa. So I have a west coast twin Lol. "
Exactly. Matte black isn’t for everyone. I’ve just always loved this look and first time I have a car nice enough to spend money on. 
Just confirmed with the shop there is no removal of bumper. 
"Yes, that is a bonus. After 4 years (maybe more) you can peel off and have a factory fresh paint job!"
"> Does it preserve the paint underneath? 

Absolutely, but it will require a quick polish and wax once you strip it ($100-$200 at any high-class detail shop).  "
"Thanks, super excited by the positive response from 99% of people. Makes the cost of the wrap hurt a touch less LOL. "
I had 10% tints when I was 18 (several years ago) and in like 8 years with that car I got one ticket for $50 that I just paid. Not that worried. 
"I knew I heard of it. That’s those videos where they turn a ball where is half coated in black, against a black backdrop, and it just disappears. That would be amazing, but like you said not practical. "
"Yeah, going to try my hardest to make it last 4 years at least. Might consider buying a cover. "
"Definitely, definitely, do the center. I realize I see that more. Hard to see the outside of the car when driving and I love driving this car!"
"Miami is definitely hot enough to justify it. 20% is dark on outside, but not that bad even at night to see out. Glad I didn’t go with the 40%. "
"Ah, this great country of mine always having to do shit the exact opposite of everyone else. 😜"
"Looking at the laws for Florida I think you can only tint front at the very top. Like where some cars get factory tint/blue dye.  The AS-1 line it’s apparently called. 

Front sides is 28%
Rear sides and back is 15%"
"3M is decent stuff IMO, I do a lot of wraps as my job.

If it is 5 years then the manufacturer will guarantee it will last 5 years on your car being outside all the time.

If it doesn't and fades (sometimes manufacturing can go wrong) then contact the wrappers who did it and tell them. The company that sold it will reimburse you will more material."
"Ya agreed OP, someone good can photoshop how would look but I kinda like the chrome. Good post."
"Just make sure they aren’t deferring the interest, and charging you all at once at the end of 15mo. "
"For sure, I totally get it. For me just getting a Tesla was a huge milestone! One thing at a time 😊"
ok! thanks for the response :)
"That’s awesome! I’m so glad to be seeing more model 3’s come out on the streets. It’s exciting. If you don’t mind me asking, how long did it take for you to get your model 3 from the day you bought it?"
"Yeah I realized my first comment was a bit harsh, sorry. I think it looks a little bit unfinished but taste is subjective so have fun with you car dude"
"Thanks for checking.  The shop I was looking at, who has also done many model 3s wanted 4k for wrap and was recommending paying extra for panel removal to properly wrap around corners.  Lucky for model 3 owners, the panel gaps should help ;)"
"LPT from a state trooper after he gave me a ticket for dark windows and windshield..  get a note from your doctor saying you are prone to skin cancer and need more uv protection. Keep it in the glove box .  Gets you out of a ticket and having to strip your tint  ..  and it’s funny if you are black or Latino  ..  You may get a ticket for something, but not tint!

"No, this is just a regular credit card with the intro APR. but after that sure it will go to like 13% or something. So I plan of having it paid by the end of 15 months anyway. "

"Thanks for the tip! 

I actually got a ticket when I was a teenager with 10% back in the day. I had 30 days to remove them, but instead I just paid the $50 fine and kept my tints on. That was like 20 years ago, so not sure if the laws have changed as far as actually getting them removed versus just paying the fine. "

I wonder how carefully they scrutinize those doctors notes...
"Doesn't carrying a balance, regardless of annual percentage rate, affect your credit?

Personal line of credit at 4-6%, while slightly more expensive, would actually increase your score... just a thought."
"Woah, well you’re lucky to have one. Congrats! I hope to get one soon as well."
In NY we can’t even pass inspection with tint :(
True .. I just think it would be kinda funny for a black dude to pull out the proverbial ‘get out of jail free’ card ..  don’t overthink it ..   
No point in arguing with doctors notes unless you are aiming to set a precedent.
"Yeah, I got my credit score up to 844 by overpaying my credit to bring all my balance negative / zero. So what you’re saying is 100% true. This will definitely put a dent, but I figure what’s the point of having good credit if you don’t use it. "
"I think you're trying to make a smart point here, but the way it's phrased, I'm not sure what that smart point is."
"> point of having good credit

Mortgage approval.

That evil laugh!!!
I did the same thing - accidentally- to my 10 year old daughter riding in the backseat. Except she thought it was hilarious and I was upset because she spilled in the new car.
This guy has also posted this other awesome thing: https://www.instagram.com/p/BjJ4LFUFynB/?taken-by=orjanburoe
I fuck with the wife as much as anyone can get away with but I would never do that. 
"You don't need a tesla to do that, I did it the other week to my wife in my 1.6 focus. You just need to time it right :D"
Dat laugh! Made me chuckle too!
[The opposite](https://youtu.be/vhsLt_pOcXY) can be done in any other regular old car.
"I did this to my wife in my Malibu Wagon but it was with an iced coffee and also by accident because I'm not an asshole.

Well... I am an asshole. Just not that type of asshole."
I feel like intentionally spilling all over your 100k car is more of a prank on yourself than anything.
What does she say in Norwegian?
That doesn't seem very nice 
I'm pretty sure a Tesla isn't the only car with some kickback
I’ve done that to myself in a Mustang. 
"I laughed way too hard at this. Was waiting for him to do something handsfree due to autopilot or something... that was so much better. 

My wife would kill me if I tried this...."
He's actually a Norwegian comedien haha
I did that to myself once. I was given a P85D loaner and decided to launch the car while drinking a hot coffee. I wasn’t expecting that jerk and spilled hot coffee all over myself.

"> due to autopilot

SAE Level 2 is not “handsfree”. Please people, this is not how automation works. It’s bad enough the older generation (60+) hates computers and the thought of them driving our cars scares the crap out of them. Level 3 and below require the driver to have their hands on the wheel. 

> The shorthand ""hands off"" is not meant to be taken literally. In fact, contact between hand and wheel is often mandatory during SAE 2 driving, to confirm that the driver is ready to intervene."
So that explains why he isn't funny.

"I've worked in automotive manufacturing a lot (on the engineering side), and also have worked at the Tesla Fremont Factory. Being in production is always tough, but I find that your experience really varies team to team and depends a lot on the production supervisor of a particular department. A bad experience with one team isn't necessarily an accurate view of the entire company. Personally, most of the production associates I worked with enjoyed their role. "
">The new report, which was commissioned by the California-based automaker, comes at an interesting time.

>In this report, Tesla is trying to highlight what they are actually contributing to the economy and directly to the government – more specifically in California, where it has most of its operations through its headquarters and the Fremont factory.

Nothing against Tesla, but a report commissioned by the company is subject to biased information."

Meanwhile how's Kansas doing?  Are low taxes and no corporate regulation working yet?
"It's important to remember that when investors say Tesla is ""Burning"" cash, they aren't literally burning cash, they're spending it on labor and materials.  That money is going somewhere.  So it's not surprising that a company that spent billions of dollars last year, had a positive effect on the economy in the billions. :D"

"By living close to the Fremont plant, I can vouch for the shear size of the plant,  number of commuters and traffic. SF Bay Area's cost of living is very expensive, and so are the California rules for corporations. I sometime wonder the cost of buying the car is not just because battery is expensive, but also labor is expensive in California. I heard Tesla is very generous with the family health plan.

Also in Fremont \(especially Mission San Jose area\), I see a Model S or X on every traffic light pretty much all the time. California definitely get a lot of tax revenues from all the local sales."
Average is $98k. Not bad.
Are Tesla workers allowed to unionise? 
What did they pay in taxes?
"These motherfuckers....there are around 10k workers at the Fremont factory, contractors and everything. Maybe another 1k at corporate. 

They hire and fire by god damn boatload and are probably claiming each and every individual that walked through the door for any reason last year, every outside contractor, every temp, every driver, everyone.

The temps from staffing agencies start on 3 month contracts so imagine how much turnaround that is!!!

Inflated and biased numbers AT BEST.

Tesla is a terrible, *terrible* company to work for.

I worked there (not as a temp but as a direct hire, full-on Tesla employee with stock and everything.) 

Never meet your idol."
Cali's GDP is around 2.5 trillion. This is a drop in the bucket.

Finally some jobs for the poor people in California...
Mmm all those money burning from investors
"That's nice. They're still operating their ""gigafactory"" in my city in a very limited capacity. Hope Tesla can justify $800+ million in taxpayer dollars being spent on building him this factory."
Is that money from bandwagon bubble investors and naive upper-middle class fools who thought buying a Model S would be a prudent investment only to discover it's the apple of cars in terms of repairability?
[deleted]
And yet Cali is still the shittiest state.
Obviously it is a threat. I hope the city/state doesn't do anything silly like Seattle. What am I thinking? Of course they will. It's California.
I hope the recent battery hype does not kill hydrogen cars.

"I dunno, man; Fox Business said Tesla were burning cash, and they looked *really* serious about it, so I'm pretty sure they really meant Elon was just shoveling it in to fire pits in the back lot of the factory.

It is almost as if having a well paid educated workforce is of value to a large technology company. 
"Man, I wouldn't build a factory in China.  All that IP will be stolen in a week"
"Teslas philosophy is to have the engineers right next to the production so they can have a faster design turn around. It has worked out so far for both factories. That's why the gigafactory is in nevada, it's close enough to commute often."
I’m pretty sure they’re scanning reddit for their 10 year plan and will take your strategy into consideration!

"> shutter the Fremont plant

There were very good fundamental reasons why Tesla picked it up so cheap, and why Toyota shut it down in the first place."
Yes if they so desire. Tesla is by policy neutral in the matter.
No...they'd get fired in a heartbeat. 
The employees pay income taxes. Tesla don't have a profit so they don't pay taxes.
What did you experience that could be widely regarded as terrible?
"An explanation like this without examples is a terrible, terrible thing to do"
"It claims:

>Tesla directly employed 20,189 


>Tesla paid its employees a total of $2.1 billion in wages and equity in FY2017.

So, if you divide the actual paid wages by the claimed # of employees you get $104k.

You claim half that # of employees, which would mean the av wages would be $208k.

Do you claim $208k wages is the average pay?"
Keep preaching man. Many of us have felt you pain. I’ve seen this first hand. You’re not alone. We all get downvotes on this sub.

Yep. This is Litterally the only reason. Open and shut case.
IHS Market made the report. You can read the report [here](https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/the-economic-footprint-of-tesla-in-california.html). There's a link to the PDF at that website. As far as I can tell IHS Market is a reputable market tracking and research company. The report itself certainly isn't wonky and a pretty easy read as far as market research papers go.
"Those questions would be the right questions. 

And

People are absolutely capable of performing studies with integrity. However, I never claimed that the investigators in this particular study lacked integrity. I was merely stating a generally known fact in research (especially in medicine) that  studies, with financial or monetary ties to the study group, are subject to biased information (whether the investigators know it or not)."
"And so if Tesla was for whatever reason fluffing all their numbers , it just simply lines up with what every big company does . Bragging about themselves to make more money "
Could you concern troll any more more blatantly?
Name a car company who didn't get a subsidy from the government. Do you remember the bailouts at the end of the last decade? Tesla has taken a single loan from the government and paid it back in full ahead of schedule. Do your research. 
"Yeah at first, I said to myself, everyone is entitled to their opinion. Then as things got worse, I said that it’s human nature to stick to your guns about a decision you’ve made in the past.

"That ""unsustainable socialist hellhole"" accounts for 14% of the US GDP and is home to some of its largest and most influential companies. Sounds like they're doing something right down there.

Few people recognize that those of us who speak up are also afraid to do so, afraid to give the larger details in fear of legal retribution.

"They won’t give you one. There was an LA Times article which added up the loan, tax credits *that may or may not be claimed by purchasers* but do not go to Tesla, and 20 years’ worth of potential future tax waivers *tied to accomplishments and milestones* in NV were lumped in as if a check had been handed to Elon.
I think some SpaceX contracts with NASA were listed but the govt. saved huge amounts of $ on those compared to Old Space bids.

I get that Tesla is just the third company to accept the agreement that NYS originally made with Silevo, but I just want them to ramp up production and get people to work.

My biggest issue I guess is with the Cuomo administration's acceptance of purchasing specialized machinery that may well be obsolete or at least not optimal for whatever innovations Tesla makes in their panels.

"IHS Markit is widely respected in the automotive industry (and probably a lot of other industries too for all I know). They also do market forecasts & analysis which are used by about everybody worldwide. My company (a global tier-1 supplier) uses IHS data (among others) to create its yearly forercasts & target strategic businesses.

If you want to focus on Tesla, their articles & reports are [here](https://ihsmarkit.com/search/results.html?search=tesla)

edit: IHZ -> IHS. Thanks for nothing, autocorrect."
"While overall I believe this, I still (naively maybe so) still support Tesla for getting whatever cashflow they can. When Walmart does it, it's fucked up and serves to boost margins. When Tesla does it, it's because they need capital to stay alive in a currently weird industry. When someone dies in one of their cars it makes news and becomes a problem they have to publically acknowledge. That isn't true of Ford, BMW, or any other brand you can name. Their whole business is more or less sustained on public trust in their long-term plan. And investments in long-term plans, especially as main-stage as their plans are, will definitely be dealt a level of scrutinity that most companies are able to slide past.

I don't know where I was going with this other than there is a reason plane crashes and crazy tesla accidents happen. And that's because they just... typically aren't that bad. And I'm sure Tesla crashes get a decent amount of news in order to sway the market in one way. But yeah. Enough said."
"I did and I get it. Just don’t act like Tesla/Elon is *that* much different than everyone else. Also, why are you defending a billionaire? Elon works his people practically to death. I don’t get the idolatry?"
I’d say $7500 for each and every car sold counts as a subsidy.  
Ford.
Those engineers that need to be on the production floor want to live in California. Force them to live in a cheap part of the country and you lose a lot of the desire to work there. 
"Tesla innovates exactly because engineering and manufacturing are *not* geographically seperated.  They might cut costs in the short term but it would kill their main advantage in the long term, which is that the desk jockeys and the guys on the floor interact on a daily basis.

Their primary facility is near Silicon Valley for a reason.

Now I do not doubt that they will expand in the future and a China location is very possible.  But I think the Fremont plant will serve as the place where they innovate for a long time and other locations will be clones of that factory."

it wasn't a ""i'm doing this for the good of the world"" sorta thing, it was a ""we need people to use our batteries as that's where our business is, if we can make them ubiquitous, then we can make a shit ton of money"". 

imo, musk is a great PR/advertising guy, they've mastered that sort of thing, even if imo they aren't that great a tech company/car company. they're second to none in the division of press and hype. 

and just for the record: their batteries are just boxes of 18650 batteries, which they buy (now make) and resell. 18650's are cheap bigger versions of AA batteries that are in basically everything.

And yet a lot of them are copied and sold to us without paying the inventor.

Is this why Tesla has so much management turnover?
There still are no examples in that. He's giving extremely vague opinions or interpretations of things that he think happened. Dude is probably in an entry level production associate role and based on his comment has absolutely zero clue how a business impacts the broader economy. These people love to trash talk Elon and Tesla because of their production struggles but ignore the ever increasing production numbers that the company is reporting. How does that make any sense? 
"To those of you who don't know, it is a widely known fact that Tesla does this and it has been discussed in length by many established/respected newspapers including these:

>The company has also angered outgoing employees by requiring them to sign a broad non-disparagement clause as part of their separation package.

>The separation agreements ban ex-employees from bad-mouthing the company, its executives, investors, affiliated companies, and contractors and products. Fired employees are prohibited from specifically criticizing Musk, in return for two weeks severance pay.

I'm sorry you are getting downvoted OP.

While I love Tesla's creations and innovations, we shouldn't let our biases cloud our judgement and treat Tesla like it is impervious to legitimate criticisms*. 

When considering corporate practices like non-disparagement clauses/forced arbitration(in both the consumer and labor sector) and consider how corporations have vast and unseemingly unlimited financial/legal resources; individual consumers and workers are often powerless in the face of legitimate grievances. Imo it benefits us all when we value and protect consumer rights and labor rights.

I wouldn't mind if we were though.
Hahahaha this isn’t close to what they are paying people.
"It’s just funny going from this sub to the other and seeing the stark differences. I wish I could say more as well but yeah I signed mine May 2016. It’s funny to see the fans of this company put down the workers  who put their heart, soul, blood, sweat and tears into this company just to be treated like shit by other people within the company. Always here to support you and all the other current and former employees on this and the other sub. I’m down to write a chapter for the book if you ever get around to it."
"It's not that these people are ostracized it's that their testimonies are not consistent with what other sources report as far as employee satisfaction. Tesla is highly rated on glass door. You see a very, very small handful of negative experiences at a factory that employs thousands.  That is not enough to deem a company shitty. "
"it was an advanced manufacturing loan for car companies.. and Tesla got a very small chunk and paid it back early. 

Lets check other companies loan amount:
Ford - 5.9 billion
nissan - 1.45 billion
Fisker - 529 mil
Tesla - 465 mil 

u/mcotter12 "
Which is why the loan was made. 
"""The loan was successful in its intent and created a net positive for the lender and the recipient, but its bad because it was made"""
"The specialized equipment purchase is a very valid point.  Tesla may be generating economic activity/jobs, etc. which is all well and good.  They are operating in a space where tech may change and render the physical plant obsolete very suddenly.

Your point is very well taken."
Jesus. Were you touched by a Tesla? Its ok you can tell us.
"Model S? 
Model X?

Model Y that is supposed to be out next year and may have a little more room. 
Can’t achieve every goal with a car. "
[They also took apart a Model S](https://technology.ihs.com/510023)
"But they are. Companies like Ford and GM owe billions to the American government and it's taxpayers that we will never see again. Tesla is reshaping the automotive industry and pushing it toward sustainability, meanwhile most other manufacturers drag their feet while funneling millions in lobbying to regulations that inhibit Tesla specifically. Open and free market my ass. The auto industry is crusty, old and suffering hugely from inertia and corruption. Tesla is pushing the envelope and innovating every day. "
Because Elon is trying to save life on earth. Old car companies are still bribing republicans to lower fuel economy standards and pollution regulations. 
There is no bigger subsidy that allowing gas cars to destroy the climate without cost.  We are effectively mooching off our kids.  Cheap energy today massive costs tomorrow. 
Tesla manufacturing is not innovative.
Apple finds away to do it without making their code get into the open. 
They should not move the software factory to China. Great assessment 
"It's my understanding that 18650 or 21700 cells have to do with just the physical dimensions of the cell. 18mm x 650mm or 21mm x 700mm respectively.

The real advantage would be the formulaic mix of lithium and other materials inside. Which isn't really indicated by the dimensions. There are [differences](http://fortune.com/2015/05/18/tesla-grid-batteries-chemistry/) between the draw characteristics between the car and PowerWall cells. 

That would be like saying grapenuts are just as good as any other cereal because it comes in the same kind of box. Despite it being an objectively shitty excuse for a cereal."
"> Even the , what’s the percentage of these 14% help infrastructure and welfare. Because I thought it’s mainly software and movies. You can’t live off Silicon Vally and silicon tits.

I can't quite parse that sentence. Are you saying that California doesn't spend enough money on welfare? How does that square with your claims of ""socialism""? Also, spending for infrastructure and welfare is generally allocated from a state's budget, i.e. from tax dollars – and I'm not sure how it would matter for those dollars in the budget whether they were paid by the movie, software, steel, or retail industry. 

EDIT: Also, interestingly and surprisingly, [manufacturing seems to make a higher overall contribution to California's GDP than ""information""](https://www.statista.com/statistics/304869/california-real-gdp-by-industry/), which I take to refer to IT, with arts and entertainment trailing far behind. I wouldn't have expected that. Goes to show that there's more to the state than Hollywood and Silicon Valley.

> Ever heard anti-suicide nets?

California is [one of the states with the lowest suicide rate per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_in_the_United_States#By_state). (rank 45 out of 50)"
"This coupled with pretty low compensation from the Bay Area, in my opinion, leads to high turnover."
">production struggles but ignore the ever increasing production numbers that the company is reporting. How does that make any sense?

This is exactly the crux of the matter. 

It is undeniable that Tesla has been having issues with production, and that executives have created aggressive production deadlines to meet such demand. These ""ever increasing production numbers"" has been a point of contention with factory labor with the issue being that Tesla is increasing productivity at the expense of worker safety and working conditions. 

If you have the time, here's a [link](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610889/tesla-says-its-factory-is-saferbut-it-left-injuries-off-the-books/ ) to a well written article by MIT's Technology Review about the labor issues. Imo it's a great article that clearly cites it's sources and provides links to various research papers, and official documents/citations.

"Thank you.

I'll take the downvotes if it means people read it. Truth hurts."
"I worked for Tesla and did not sign a non-disparagement agreement during my exit interview. Nor did I ever have an employee that was dismissed sign one. Non-disclosure agreement when I was hired, yes. But that was concerning the IP.

"yeah there are different chemistries in them just like there are in AA batteries. 

edit: just to reiterate as people seemed to get the wrong idea about what i was saying: tesla didn't use anything special atleast up until about 2 years ago, no different chemistries or anything.

it's not some magic mix they use though, they just use off the shelf'd ones, or atleast used to. "
"Nope, companies applied for certain amounts based on what they thought they needed to complete the goal of the loan project. 

That’s why fisker got awarded more than tesla."
"I missed the second part of your comment. I'm not defending Elon, I'm defending Tesla. Elon is not the only mind in that operation nor is he the only leader. Nevertheless, I will say that your comment about Elon working his people to death is baseless and seems like it's something you just spit out because you heard someone else say it. Have you worked for Tesla or SpaceX? Many, many employees from those companies report being happy with what they do. 

As well, what does it matter if Elon is a billionaire? You do realize that his net worth doesn't mean he has billions in cash, right? He's a billionaire because he helped build two companies that are now worth tens of billions. The guy doesn't even get paid a salary from tesla. He starts side companies and research groups with his extra spending money. The fact that he's a billionaire has almost nothing to do with the conversation. "

"The fact that constantly have qc issues is quite indicative that what they are doing isn't innovative. The tear down of the model 3 showed that they were behind modern manufacturers in many ways. 

What makes you think they are innovative besides what Elon claims?"
"You should watch this: https://youtu.be/CpCrkO1x-Qo

I think you may have some misunderstanding of Tesla's battery tech. For the roadster the small packs were made of mostly off the shelf batteries. Since then they have been custom."

"hi, can you link the place where it is?

i jumped to some of the battery talk but 5 mins in i'm still listening to them talk about the contacts. 

the argument was never ""they don't make novel batteries"" it's, ""they never used to (atleast up until the 2nd tesla iirc)"", the patent is (again iirc) about the configuration of the batteries, not the battery chemistry. 

(which any engineering grad could probably throw up, you get a power graph for what you're looking for and stick them in series/parallel to get that, this is pretty simplified though)

the config thing came up in a reddit thread about a year back. "

Compartmentalism. With the huge differences in children’s height and weight and the fact they don’t trust them to wear their seatbelts properly they designed the seats to cushion the impact. Although I’m sure with a complete redesign they could be made safer with belts.

"It's so stupid that the public perception behind Tesla's AutoPilot is literally ""get in car, car takes me to destination without any human interaction, get out of car"". This is the root cause of all the articles about Tesla crashes. Not sure if it's Tesla's fault for using the term ""AutoPilot"" in their marketing, or just improper consumer education."
Which is crazy. Buses don't react when hit by other vehicles.  I was on a bus where the guy in a pickup rear ended it.  No one on the bus felt a thing. The truck was destroyed.
"Yeah but the recent school bus crash wasn't minor, it was fatal"

"I think that would be up to the schools administration if they want to send chaperones to school related sports and events for the blind. However, I could see it being an issue with some parents if their blind kids were left completely unattended at sporting events. "
"I read a bus driver’s comment in an AMA a couple months ago, which touched on this. He said something to the effect of the seats being basically an egg carton (very shock absorbing), and unworn seat belts turn into projectiles in a crash and any that are being worn make a high-speed evacuation nearly impossible. Basically it amounted to “you’re safer without them, as counterintuitive as that seems”. 

I don’t know how much truth there was to the statement, but there’s a data point for you. "
"There’s reasons they do t have seatbelts, they are safer without them. Unless they roll over. "
Yeah. That’s what inspired me this am. National news was running a story on bus safety and how they want to mandate seatbelts. Automatic braking. Cameras around it. Other safety stuffs. Figured with the semi having a lot of that... it kinda made sense despite my incredibly ugly rendition. 
Seatbelts on school busses cause more injuries than they prevent. It's not an accident that they aren't used. Busses are extremely safe.
"If you have been in an accident on the bus, you would no seat belts are not needed.

They would only help in a roll over. They would do nothing in a regular crash.

Most school buses drive city and town streets and rarely go on interstates."

Cheaper options exist, such as propane and natural gas (compressed natural gas or CNG). And if you use renewable natural gas (RNG, same molecule, just a non-fossil source), you get an even better carbon benefit than battery electric."
"Probably more practical and easier to implement than a long-haul truck, too"
"I think that might be hard to get under an overpass. However, on the more serious end, I do believe there is such a thing as ""Tesla Camping"" where people fold the seat down and run the AC or heat accordingly overnight. "

Meanwhile the bus gets taken back to the garage to have the fender unbent.

Kids are safer in a school bus than they are in a lot of cars on the road. Unless they're getting T-boned by a semi going fast or something, there's generally nothing to worry about almost ever as far as the bus's design/safety goes.

Sorry, I've been wanting to say that for years now, and this is the first time I've seen something relevant."

"over the air update for brake performance

wtf desla"
I got it yesterday.  I didn't notice but I didn't notice any problems before either.  I've never had to do hard braking (edit: in my 3) and I hope I never do.
Can someone eli5 how this is possible to do ota?
"What is the total braking distance that 20 feet was shaved off of, and what is a good distance for a comparably-sized car? Consumer Reports originally compared the Model 3 to a F150 in terms of braking distance."

And they said there's no stopping innovation..
Time for testing and hopefully a thumbs up!

"It's very important to note what happened. They had the ABS system turned up too high under panic braking, and it was causing permanent damage to the pads that would reduce the panic stop distance after that until they were replaced. They simply turned it down from 11. Now, panic stopping gets slightly longer under all conditions, but it isn't destroying pads after 1 very hard stop."
**Repeated** heavy braking? Does this change the performance of the car the first time you apply the brakes hard (like in an emergency) or just when they're being repeatedly being tested by journalists (similar to a 'defeat device).
"So now the braking is more consistent (needs to be verified, but for now let's assume the fix works). 130 feet is still not good. As others have mentioned, there are vehicles that brake much better. Even the A4 does 60-0 in 105 feet. That's a pretty significant difference, and I suspect it's the brake pads, considering the results of several track sessions that I've seen others do, including one where the brakes effectively vaporized after a few laps.

Anyone have any recommendations? "
Thats so fucking cool
Got a recall notice yesterday for my S’s power steering. Wish they could handle that OTA. The Orlando service center is among the worst places on earth.
Doesn't seem to leave much time for testing...
"The fix is out really really quick. It makes me think they already knew about it. It makes me think the software was specifically designed to slow down subsequent panic stops. So.. why? There must have been a good reason to do that. What purpose does slower panic stops serves?

And then, is this CR problem really a problem? Who does multiple panic stops in a row? Is this a behavior that only occurs in testing? 

So, I ask, what did we just lose now that the software has been changed to perform for the test?"
What version number should we be expecting this braking update on? 2018.18.13? 
Got my update last night!
"This has yet to be tested, we will see."
"130 ft would be middle of the pack in this test group.

https://www.cars.com/articles/is-the-bmw-330i-still-fastest-in-its-class-1420696013303/"
"I'd like to have better details on my updates, I got an update a week ago, and then a day ago (for this) that literally had the same exact release notes.  No mention of brakes performance improvement or anything."
Its a little concerning that it took CR's testing to notice and fix this. 
60-0 in 132 feet instead of 152 feet is still notably worse than a new Honda Odyssey minivan (124 feet)... which weighs nearly 1000 pounds more...
I hope the new breaking algorithm was thoroughly validated and field tested in all possible breaking conditions before rollout.
"40? Do I hear 40 feet?

This is cool. "
"This is only going to get better. The more people use Teslas, the more data they collect, the more corrections they can make, and the better the logic will be in the end. 

Like, imagine if humans learned from their mistakes and improved upon themselves? Not possible what so ever, but imagine the possibilities! "
"As I recall, many years ago when I took Porsche's racing school at Sebring in cars without ABS, we were taught that the maximum braking was to apply braking pressure until the tires started chirping and to try and hold it at that point.  That pumping the brakes would not provide the minimum stopping distance because you are only applying braking force for part of the time and that this method would beat ABS every time because any method that involves pumping the brakes means that the duty cycle (i.e. time friction was being applied) would be less than 100% and more likely closer to 50% whereas holding the brake pressure steady at tire chirping is just before lockup so maximum friction at 100% of the time.  

I am somewhat surprised that with today's electronics a similar type of braking system hasn't been developed to replace ABS where a microphone listens for the tires to start chirping and hold the pressure constant at that point before lockup or it could also do something similar by sensing wheel rotation and where lockup occurs and backing off just slightly from that and holding rather than pumping which is based on dated technology."
What I dont like about updating cars is what if a bug passes testing and suddenly every tesla in the world gets into a crash?
Let's all go slam our brakes on to test this.
"That's cool and everything, but I'm not sure this excuses his twitter meltdown. That was kind of over\-the\-top. "
"if braking distance is affected by the software and the car is internet connected, couldn't someone theoretically maliciously fuck with a car's firmware and cause a wreck? kinda spooky.."
"I've been wondering, does hard breaking automatically engage regenerative breaking at maximum as well?  Even if regen is, for example, set to low in settings.  This would help with emergency breaking."
It would help to know which version of the software.  I know we are all guessing it is 2018.18.13 but no where does it say anything about a brake fix in the release notes.  The lack of good release notes is one of my major frustrations with Tesla's software development team.  Why not provide a list of things fixed in a release along with any new features.
"Ok, at this point I'm inclined to believe that there are nanobots in every Model 3..."
"This is the future people. Every company is going to become a software company. The products you buy will not decrease in quality over time, they will actually increase in quality. I hope more companies start thinking like this. Meanwhile, Apple does programmed obsolescence. "
"Over 7feet, now 20 feet saved for a total of 13 feet saved. I'll be! Can't wait to see consumer reports Do a retest. "
I sure hope Elon makes his journalist website... and how about a new social media while we’re at it? One where people aren’t left with funneled choices that leave them with only options of stupidity.
"6,09mts."
"I've been wondering, does hard breaking automatically engage regenerative breaking at maximum as well? Even if regen is, for example, set to low in settings. This would help with emergency breaking.

"
"why is a computer controlling all the breaking?

why not use a proper mechanical system?

seems idiotic to design something that is limited by the code you've typed in, when most other cars on the street isn't"
But liberals hate elon now
Does that mean my Tesla's brakes can get hacked?!
"question is: was Tesla caught with a defeat device on their breaking system to prevent overuse of pads? Problem seems to be with ""repeated"" tests."
"Are there plans to apdate Telsa's with regenerative braking?

Seems a shame to turn all that energy into heat and friction."
It's a balance between friction brakes and electronic brakes and energy efficiency and braking efficiency.
"> Tesla ftw

FTFY"
"Well, they shouldn't have had this issue anyway. I would assume they would have tested the braking performance at their QA stage.

Edit: I know I'm gonna be down voted but any other automaker would have been super critized for that and everyone is like ""wow Tesla ota update"". Same for the auto wiper. Love Tesla but this is PR for technology that has been working for years and Tesla is using a different way and struggle to make it to today's standard."
"Well, we did get an fw update via SC for one second performance improvement for 0-60mph, so...."
It has something to do with the abs. You can either get as much energy out of the car or you can make the car more steerable during an emergency brake. And now Tesla shifted the focus more on taking energy out. 
"Nanobots, duh."
"Both amazing and scary, I mean, if a hacker can affect braking… 😬"
"It’s a good thing to know how quickly your car can stop from highway speed, worth trying it out if there’s no one around. "
"You need to do this with every car. New or old, you must understand how your car will react in these situations and how you react to the car in that situation.

Do it once a month to exercise your brakes. 
What’s the firmware version?
But hard braking and pedal to the floor acceleration are components of fun driving. Are you seriously never going to push your car a little bit or take your car up to the canyons for some spirited driving?
What a useless comment but getting up voted lol 
The physical brakes were capable of quickly slowing down. The computers anti-lock system prevented enough force from being applied. That computer problem has been corrected. 
"Eli5: The computer controls the braking.   
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brake-by-wire"
The brake pedal is merely a suggestion about how you want to stop. The computer does the rest. Code it to apply more pressure in a more controlled manner means better stopping.
"All Teslas have internet-connected capabilities - they have their own built-in LTE connection, as well as can attach to home WiFi networks. When connected to the internet, they will periodically check Tesla's servers for firmware updates, which will be downloaded if present. My understanding is that Teslas are the only cars in the world whose firmware is completely upgradable over the internet (low-level firmware as well as higher level autopilot-type functionality all the way up to user interface improvements for the central touchscreen)."
"About 152 feet

About 132 feet is new distance

Smort
Oh shit... That would make an excellent plate for my 3. Gonna check if it's available next week.
Noice!
Leave it to Tesla to... uh... brake that mold.
Unexpectedly clever pun 
They said there’s no stopping
"Yeah, wasn‘t Teslas first reaction to this excellent critival feedback „this is not true, there is no problems with the brakes“?"
That's not really true though. Smart phones are a good counter point. They have free updates. I don't see why Tesla shouldn't be the same.
"I dont think the market will like that.  when we buy stuff we want it to be 100% finished, and with almost all products, they are.  with software thats almost impossible with bugs and hardware issues, and we expect our software to work 100% of the time.  to keep up with that until a product is obsolete or replaced there HAS to be support from developers for mass market software, it needs to be built into the costs on the producers side"
Automakers will always miss something. Cars are incredibly complicated machines.
"Because testing wasn't thorough enough, apparently.  We live in an age where videogame studios and car manufacturers ship a 90% working product, with plans to ""patch the rest later"".  Scary to think about."
"Because ATM is Turing undecidable. In other words it is mathematically impossible to create an algorithm that determines whether another algorithm does X. 

So what software engineers do is create test cases and use a whole bunch of complex testing techniques to verify that their algorithms work correctly. The rigor of these tests depend on the secret of the problem that they're trying to solve. However even the best testing methods can't ensure that a non-trivial algorithm is infaliable. 99.99% unfortunately isn't 100%.

There can be tiny little edge cases that cause discrepancies (ie bugs). These edge cases may not pop up until the software is being used at a large scale with hundreds of thousands of users. 

This is possibly what happened with the braking system. "
Nobody's perfect. A lot of what they're doing has never been done before.
Pretty much all cars these days are heavily computerized. 
[deleted]
"There is fully mechanical ABS, but most are electronic controlled ABS. Generally the electronics are isolated, not networked and read only, is extremely difficult for the average mug to modify the programming."
[deleted]
Too bad they have adopted the testing methodology of a video game company.
"The Honda Accord is assembled in Marysville, Ohio. So technically your grandpa still bought an American car"
"Has this been confirmed?  Would make sense, but I haven't seen that anywhere.  Also, would require a recall of all cars that have done panic braking from highway speeds, which I haven't heard mentioned yet.  If the OTA update fixes the CR car, that would disprove this. It could just be that the ABS wasn't optimized."
"> It's very important to note what happened.

**It's also important to note how much faster Tesla is able to fix the cars of affected customers, by issuing the update over the air, with zero installation costs**.

Consider some of the past faulty brakes incidents of competitors, such as Toyota, Nissan and Mercedes:

> TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION (TMC) announces a recall related to the software program that controls the antilock braking system (ABS) in current-model ""Prius"", ""Prius Plug-in Hybrid"", ""Sai"" and ""HS250h"" sold in Japan.
>
http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/news/10/02/0209.html

>
>   Nissan Motor Co. is recalling more than 188,000 Nissan and Infiniti SUVs worldwide to fix faulty brake control software that could increase the risk of a crash.

>
https://www.zdnet.com/article/prius-recall-pales-next-to-faulty-software-in-mercedes-sensotronic-brakes/
>

Those ""recalls"" have a typical latency of weeks, sometimes even months, when the car goes to service next time around. 

*Technically* and legally it's the ""fault"" of consumers as they were ""warned"" that a mandatory recall has been done - but most people will not notice obscure notifications, and many will skip the extra trip to the service.

But in the end the effect is the same: **the overwhelming majority of ICE car consumers get critical fixes installed late and at significant consumer expense** (the manufacturer does not pay for the lost time spent going to the service), while Tesla does it as fast as possible and without creating extra expense for customers.

This IMO makes a *huge* difference to overall safety...
"
I wonder if this was a defeat device for mileage
"Different tires and possibly different conditions.  Model 3 was in the 110's with the Sport wheels during some trials.  Performance and especially summer tires will always do better in the dry, will likely do worse in the wet, and will wear out faster.  Stock 18"" all season tires on the Tesla may not be comparable to the A4 tires tested.  It's not the brake pads, as long as they can lock up the wheels (easy to do for even cheap pads) then they're strong enough for emergency braking.  The distance is really only due to the tires, the weight and the ABS."
"Interesting, this article has 2017 Audi A4 at 135ft.   Motor Trend has 105 ft.   

https://www.cars.com/articles/is-the-bmw-330i-still-fastest-in-its-class-1420696013303/"
Is that for the bolts ?
Think how much testing could be done in 8 hours with just one car and a team of engineers. Add another day or two for data reduction. You can do a lot in a day or two if it is focused. 
"CR even tried doing a panic stop, then letting the car sit overnight, then trying a second one the next day. It still took a long distance to stop."
All good questions.  Elon's choice of words also make it sound like the fix was specifically for these synthetic test conditions of repeated hard stops.
"> What purpose does slower panic stops serves?

No purpose I imagine but there is a fine line between braking too much and too little. Regen braking might complicate things further.

Perhaps it was a tuning bug. Perhaps it was lifted off the model S but some parameters were incorrect and introduced incorrect behavior upon receiving feedback from sensors during a brake."
"It's unlikely to need many repeated panic stops in real life, but there are several reasons for testers to do multiple ones in a row. They may do the test from 70 to 0, but on many US roads the common speed is 75 to 80, sometimes higher. Energy - which must all be absorbed by the brakes - increases exponentially with speed. So, a series of 70-to-0 stops can offer some indication of how the car will perform in a 80-to-0 stop. An actual 80-to-0 stop would be better, but that adds safety risks (especially if the brakes fail after the car has only slowed to 50 mph, for example). Also, you always want to over-test things because that helps create a larger margin of safety in case some car leaves the production line with a manufacturing error. Rather than simulating every error (most of which are hard to predict), it's a lot easier to over-test and make everything better than it needs to be - and hope that is enough margin to cover any errors that slip by.

If it can do it once, then you know it did it once. But if it can do it many times, then you know that it can do it reliably."
You're reading too much into the situation. It was probably just a small bug in the braking algorithm that presented itself after repeated emergency brakes (a scenario the engineers must not have tested). Probably a variable in the code that wasn't reset properly. Very easy to fix.
2018.18.13 6a8a06e rolled out (to me) last night so that must be it. I'm pretty sure I was on a different 2018.18.13 before that (edit: it must have been 2018.18.3 as stated below).
Elon said that further improvements were in the works and he wouldn't quit until Model 3 had superior braking performance.  Stay tuned.
"> No mention of brakes performance improvement or anything.

There's two things:

- Tesla is usually doing a 'gradual roll-out': first release it to a smaller set of cars, wait for feedback data, then broaden the roll-out.
- Even if you got the fix via an update already, they probably don't want to prematurely claim that it's fixed, until they get all the instrumentation data back from the whole fleet.
"
"> Its a little concerning that it took CR's testing to notice and fix this. 

Tesla is still early in the manufacturing ramp-up with less than 50,000 cars delivered and just about 6 months into general-public delivery.

Here's examples of brake system failures of other major manufacturers, much further into the ramp-up and a lot later after the introduction of the model:

> - [Toyota faulty brake system recall: 220,000+ cars.](
> http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/news/10/02/0209.html)
>
> - [Nissan faulty brake system recall: 180,000+ cars.](
> https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nissan-recalls-over-188000-suvs-to-fix-brakes/)

> https://www.zdnet.com/article/prius-recall-pales-next-to-faulty-software-in-mercedes-sensotronic-brakes/)

What is exemplary about the handling of this by Tesla is the fact that it could be fixed so quickly and at no extra expense to the customer: no trip to the service, no lost time and productivity, etc.
"
Results are all over the map depending on who did the testing. CR got 136 for the Odyssey if you're trying to line up the apples.
that would be impossible.
"I mean, with better AEB, won't there be times when it brakes -50 feet?"
"> where a microphone listens for the tires to start chirping

This would be somewhat fragile, any ambient noise (such as a nearby car braking hard) could confuse such a sensor.

It's also suboptimal with certain types of pavement: for example a gravel road might create a ""chirping"" sound all the time, keeping the brakes from working.

Eventually AI will control the brakes too, taking into account a host of other high level information, such as:

- The orientation of the car: when a crash is imminent and the car is half off the pavement already, it might be safer to not brake at all, because that would risk turning the car sideways where crashes are much more dangerous.
- Outside weather and road conditions: for example on a snow covered road maximum grip braking can actually be achieved by going into reverse and maxing out RPM (!). This is not a manoeuvrer a human driver is able to control in a safe fashion normally.
- On outright brake pad failure there could be an emergency mechanism to turn up 100% regen braking, even if it risks burning out the battery controller. They could use a one time use, cheaper to replace sacrificial fuse that would turn this excess energy into evaporated carbon or something like that.
- Location of the passengers: if the car AI *knows* (from internal cameras and weight sensors) that there's only the driver present, in some situations it might use the right side of the car as a sacrificial crash buffer crunch zone.

etc., etc.

The number of smart safety decisions an AI could do in milliseconds would make a huge difference to practical safety - beyond the more mundane uses like optimal use of brakes.

"That's why they roll out gradually.  Anything that bad would be caught during internal testing.  Larger and larger groups of customers then get the rollouts so that rarer problems still have a small impact and stuff like this never affects large numbers of drivers.

Don't want to be that driver affected by a rare problem?  Then you don't get to benefit from the huge benefits, including safety benefits, that updates provide."

"Want to know what is cool?  CR sitting on a unique test result for who knows how long just to make money off of their announcement.  Then putting out a recommendation that is designed to mislead.

Tesla kinda shamed them hard by pushing out a software fix for this.  CR held back a test result for personal gain at the expensve of people's lives."

"Yes, it's a risk, though Tesla takes security very, very seriously and follows a lot of best practices that makes this unlikely.  Note that it hasn't yet despite the fact that so many people seem to hate and/or be threatened by Tesla.  And don't forget the safety benefits of OTA updates which exceed this risk.

Also, nothing can stop pushing the brakes from stopping your car, the software can only turn off ABS at worst.  The motors for autosteer are easily overpowered by any adult.  The worst they could do would be to accelerate the car, but braking would instantly turn this off and even if it didn't, brakes are designed to always be able to overpower the accelerator.  "
"I thought the same thing, but remember that this are anti-lock breaks. It needs to brake as hard as possible but no so hard that the wheels lock. The breaks can probably achieve locking very easily. The hard part is to maintain the optimum balance between breaking power and not locking the wheel."
"The brakes are the most powerful thing in the car. They don't need help stopping the car. And regen in such a rare case won't save any significant energy (how often do you slam on the brakes) and makes the job more complicated. The computer is modulating the brake effort millisecond by millisecond to prevent the wheels from sliding no matter how hard you slam on the brakes. Once the wheels start sliding, you lose 80% of your braking effectiveness, as well as the ability to maintain directional control. It's too crucial a moment to be futzing around with trying to save a few watt-hours here or there. "
"On the contrary, your car will decrease faster... first iphone is obsolete right? "

Computers are not controlling all the *braking; it is controlling the ABS just like every other car in the world with ABS.
"All modern cars use ABS to reduce stopping distance. If your tires lock up, not only do you lose control of the vehicle, your stopping distance increases. That is because the static coefficient of friction of a tire on rubber is significantly higher than the dynamic coefficient of friction."
"Yes, lets use 1960's technology. Electronic control of ABS is over 40 years old."

"> brakes can get hacked

Just to explain why you got so many downvotes: the ability of Teslas to be fixed 'over-the-air' means that **Tesla's brakes get updated much faster**, and get updated for the whole fleet, while brake system related recalls of other manufacturers take much more time and are also much more expensive:

> - [Toyota faulty brake system recall.](
> http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/news/10/02/0209.html)
>
> - [Nissan faulty brake system recall.](
> https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nissan-recalls-over-188000-suvs-to-fix-brakes/)
>
> - [Mercedes faulty brake system recall.](
> https://www.zdnet.com/article/prius-recall-pales-next-to-faulty-software-in-mercedes-sensotronic-brakes/)
>

Such recalls and fixes take days, weeks or months (!) to actually be installed on customer cars, and in addition to the fact that customers are at danger while a fix is not installed, it's also done at a significant extra expense to those customers even when a mandatory recall is ""free"", as the extra trip to the service, the lost time and inconvenience is not something manufacturers reimburse their customers for.

In this case Tesla was able to fix their brake system much faster and much cheaper than any of these competitors was able to achieve.
"
Why would Tesla want to prevent overuse of replaceable items that the owner would have to pay to replace anyway? This motive makes no sense.
??? Teslas all have regen braking...
Theoretically Teslas are already regenerating the maximum amount the batteries can reliably handle.  This is all about the extra stopping power needed for an emergency stop.  That's way more power than the batteries alone could handle.
"I think it was more that their ABS algorithm was too conservative in preventing wheel lock-ups and was therefore not using all the available grip.

https://i.imgur.com/zkKEo7j.jpg
~~So their ABS active zone line would have been too low
https://i.imgur.com/0bVv3hc.jpg~~
I guess their ‘ABS zone’ was too conservative/wide
https://i.imgur.com/AP66NJ7.jpg


But its quite amazing they can fix these issues with OTA updates."
You say that like it's any less amazing.
"That would mean the brakes alone are insufficient to hit the tire traction limit. So hopefully you're wrong, because that would be a pretty negative thing..."
"> I know I'm gonna be down voted but any other automaker would have been super critized for that and everyone is like ""wow Tesla ota update"". 

Tesla _was_ heavily criticised by it. There is just the difference that for other brands this would have been something like a recall. That's all. And I'd rather have it OTA than a huge recall. Not to mention ""shouldn't have had this issue any way"" is, unfortunately, for _a lot of things_ not just Tesla or car industry in general... There is a plethora of hazards in our lives introduced by humans. Everything from electricity to blender to microwave oven... Anything can have defects that the producer overlooked/didn't see/ignored that can endanger us. 

Trust me, I'm not saying this as an apology on behalf of Tesla (no affiliation, besides). What I'm saying is, that shit happens and most of the time it isn't about _that_ it happened, but how it's being dealt with when it happened so that it's fixed and/or doesn't happen again. So yes, they _should have_ seen it before shipping, I don't know why they didn't, but they didn't, happens, we're all humans that can make mistakes, even when triple checking.

Edit: spelling

"This type of stuff happens to any other car maker. The difference is that they need to do a mass recall and all Tesla has to do now is push an OTA update. This is much less of an inconvenience for their customers.

I've already had to go to my dealership twice for software related recalls. 'Luckily' I had hardware issues at the same time, so I was already heading there. Also, I have a reproducible bug in my automatic braking system, causing it to brake every time I pass a specific section of road, but I haven't a clue how to actually report it. With a Tesla, all I'd have to do is tweet Elon.

Have you heard of any of these that I'm having online? No, you haven't, because it's not a Tesla. Do a Google search for ""[Prius recalls](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Prius+recalls)"" for example and check how many of these were ""super criticized"" or even got as much attention as Teslas automatic fucking wipers."
">Well, they shouldn't have had this issue anyway.

Automakers have recalls all the time. Shit happens.

Tesla fixed what would normally require a recall with an over-the-air software update. That is pretty amazing."
They did...
"The car is like a software, maybe it was breaking well enough at the start but a later patch ""fixing"" some breaking scenario introduced the issue on long distance breaking."
"5.3 million Jeep and Chrysler owners told to not use cruise control, they have to bring their cars in to the dealer for a software update."
Yeah right. Other automakers never have problems like this. Just look at all the recalls other car makers do all the time. Their QA is anything but perfect.
All modern cars are hackable with the right know how. It's actually scary how many things you can do with cars remotely if you're ok with breaking the law
A hacker will have access to gas/brake/autopilot but yeah sure it's the ABS they will mess with.
[deleted]
"In order to use OTA updates to push a hack, the hacker would need physical access to Teslas buildings. There they would need to get what is probably Teslas most highly secured secret, which is a code they use to make their car recognize the software update as an actual Tesla update. This is highly unlikely. Then they would probably need some way to fake that they're pushing the code from a trusted server, which is actually less of an issue."
I'd rather not put unnecessary wear/damage on my brakes/pads.  I've done it in beater cars enough times to know how abs works.  If I needed to I'd do full force braking but otherwise no.
"Similarly, now and again I like to overtake cars even when I'm not in an hurry and I know it's a very safe place. Why? To learn/remind me my car's acceleration as well as perception of distance."
Better start brake checking all of the X owners I see on the highway. 
"My dad always taught me, “First snow of the year, do a tire test.” Go somewhere safe like a big empty parking lot and practice accelerating, braking, and turning.

That way if it turns out your tires are too worn and need to be replaced, you find out BEFORE the middle of winter."
"100% this. These people freak me out, they don't know basic stuff about their car like how fast it can stop, and he says he doesn't even care to know. They're driving a ton of metal at high speeds. Fucking terrifying."
">I've never had to do hard braking

I took this as saying ""never"" while owning his Model 3, reason why he can't notice a difference.

Or are you saying he should have used his Model 3 in driving school? As that would cause me to have a lot more questions."
We never did hard braking in driving class. 
Nope

That's scary
[The braking files are *in the computer*!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV3Oncvz_cU)
"Tesla's don't have brake-by-wire, they are plain 'ol hydraulic brake pedals. You can test this if you pull the first responder loop and disconnect the 12v battery so there is no power, the brakes will work fine. You just need to push harder because there is no brake booster."
"It's not *exactly* brake by wire.  There is still a physical connection between the brakes and the brake pedal.  But there is [a brake booster](https://www.bosch-mobility-solutions.com/en/products-and-services/passenger-cars-and-light-commercial-vehicles/driving-safety-systems/brake-booster/ibooster/index.html) attached.  Brake by wire (which companies are working on also) implies that there is no mechanical connection from pedal to brakes, only an electronic sensor."
It's not brake-by-wire. They're hydraulic assisted brakes. That doesn't mean there's not a computer in the loop however.
"This may be the case on an airbus 380, but Tesla cars have conventional hydraulic brakes actuated by a plain old master cylinder actuated by the brake pedal directly mechanically."
This is damn scary
FYI model 3 doesn’t currently connect to WIFI.. Its still a WIP.
"I believe the question was more along the lines of ""How can you gain 20ft of stopping distance with a software update?"""
My understanding is Software can be updated over the net. Firmware needs to be brought in. When they uncorked my 75D I had to bring it to a SC to upgrade the firmware. it could not be done over the net. 
"Way late to the comment party but 132' is not very good when comparing to other cars very close in size and cost. The Cadillac ATS-V can do the same stop in 99' that's a huge margin. Hopefully the performance version of the model 3 has better brakes or that claim of beating any car in it's class at the track will be impossible around a road course. I really hope motor trend does a head to head of the model 3 performance version against the ATS-V, the BMW M3 is also in the running but the Cadillac is currently on top around the track so I'm really interested to see where the model 3 will fit in. I wish GM would start transitioning Cadillac to EV's as I see them as the closest current vehicle to Tesla of the ICE vehicles and going EV would make them near direct competitors."
Toight!
Would be cool if the 'ice' part were in italics :D.
Noice!
"People already struggle with ""brake"" vs ""break."" Don't blur the line further."

"
No. But I’ve seen a lot of Reddit liars claiming it was. We all need to be a lot more careful about believing everything we read on here.
"but not all smart phone makers have software costs. that's paid to Google. LG doesn't have the same software costs as Apple as LG uses Android. Tesla has everything in house and doesn't have a 2 year replacement cycle like smartphones have either.

I see your point but if Tesla's software was on all other cars and was paid licensing fees for use or made money elsewhere through an ecosystem like the playstore and apps then your analogy would work better. "
this is part of the reason Tesla needs to have such high margins. but over time how can Tesla affordo provide lifetime car updates? you even have to pay $300 for GPS upgrade in other cars. they are making up these costs elsewhere then.... or fully autonomous cars will be subscription based. I can see that. 
"""We never thought to test the brakes."" ?"
I don’t see any other automaker than Tesla offering constant updates to their cars treating it like some live beta test. Don’t lump the rest of the automakers into this category 
"Well, one car manufacturer."
"Stopping twice, quickly, is now a ""tiny little edge case""...?
"
As a software engineer I don't disagree.  This is a critical safety feature of a vehicle though and it was very easily reproduced by Consumer Reports.  That's my concern.  I do appreciate the quick turnaround from Tesla and the over-the-air updates are one of the many reasons I am looking forward to the 3
ABS has been done before
Tesla should not mess with braking. 
Yeah but never with this level of consumer involvement.
No other car has OTA updates for its drivetrain and brakes.
"Right, because no other automaker ever had problems with their cars that could result in deaths. The difference is, some automakers wait until the cost of lawsuits exceeds the costs of a recall or the government forces one, and Tesla does OTA updates in a matter of days."
"> most just don’t have OTA capability

So then they aren't the same..."
"I'm honestly not sure. I got a letter saying ""your car has a recall but we don't have the parts, we'll let you know when we do""

"
"I agree, maybe he thinks that the CR test is kinda bs but doesn’t want to say it so he’s just showing everyone that he’ll play by their rules and still win."
"I'm not questioning the testing. The testing is perfectly reasonable.

I want to know why did Tesla code the ABS to fade? There must have been a good reason."
Nit: Energy increases with the square of speed*
A variable not being reset is a good possibility. Thanks for that.
"I was on 2018.18.3 (updated six days ago) and got 2018.18.13 last night. I bet that was it, too."
"They can say brake system modification, rather than improvement. "
"No, no, no, let’s pick the best results from one tester, and the worst results from another treater, then use a twitter post about the expected improvement to compare the two. "
"Yeah. Probably. Makes me wonder if near instant over the air updates to automobile safety features is, well, safe. Not sure I'd want to be beta testing a new breaking algorithm.

Edit: particularly when released to counter a negative review."
"You can't test 100%, but you can get close.  I knew a few software engineers that worked on brakes.  They would go to summer and winter test trips on closed courses every season for new products. There's a huge list of cases they test on different courses to prove out the ecu and configurations."
"‘‘Twas an attempt a humour governor. 

Everyone’s making a big deal about 20 feet, and that’s delivered via sw. Since shorter stopping distances and consistency are important it was a challenge to Elon to deliver 40’.

Of course, accomplishing that we’d join the media in calling for millimeter stopping distances with zero G forces on passengers. "
All great points.  I guess my point was that BAS does not provide optimal braking and given the advances in technology since ABS was developed it is surprising that better technology hasn't been utilized.  Even back in the 80s it was known that pumping the brakes was not an optimal strategy to stop in the shortest distance.
"That's not how it came off to me. Maybe I missed some inside joke. The whole twitter chain was weird, and I don't check r/tesla every day. If it was a joke, it was not obvious."
"Yeah, I'm not sure what I expected posting something like this on this sub. I mean, if they checked my history I have been a long\-time fan of tesla and musk."
Wtf are you taking about? 
"What koolaid have you been drinking? I've got a model 3 reserved and I am very excited about most of the work musk is doing. However, I'm allowed to disagree with certain things he does. I don't follow his Twitter ever, and I saw his Spiel against Consumer reports posted somewhere and it came off very poorly to me. So fuck off with your robot claim."
"No my thinking was that it could help reduce breaking distance by augmenting breaks.  But I now I've learned that sliding is the limiting factor, not breaking power."
"I'm not sure that we've seen the end of the war on dealerships. I predict that business model will peter out in just the way of the taxi companies, though clearly it's going to take longer. Tesla's got a decidedly strong competitive advantage on that front that GM, Ford, and Toyota are going to start looking at with big eyes and big stomachs as Elon's scalability issues get solved."
"Other automakers can do OTA updates. However, I believe they are limited to infotainment stuff."
"Once your iPhone battery is deteriorated from running to many charge cycles, Apple committed the crime of throttling the CPU and GPU to avoid having them draw more power than the deteriorated battery could deliver. Which would result in the phone crashing.

In Tesla terms, when your lithium battery pack is frozen to the bone due to low temperatures, Tesla won’t allow you to charge it until the battery pack have been heated enough to avoid damaging the batteries. That’s why regen and charging is limited initially during winter. 

Some people believe they should have the option of crashing their phones / destroying their battery packs. Companies fight this, because odd are that after abusing the shit out a product? The neck beard will blame the company for shitty quality. Despite the warnings about not doing XYZ.

For references? See how some people use Autopilot / AR-15’s

There’s always that 0,1% retards out there. Which begs the question. Should laws/rules be made to account for the 99,9% or the 0,1%?

It’s a tough question."
"Well, he may be overly enthusiastic and everything, but it's true that Software Eats Everything. So he's mostly right."
I don't think ABS necessarily decreases stopping distances. But it helps maintain stability and maneuverability in hard braking environments. 
"I realized after the post that batteries can be discharged much faster than they can be recharged, therefore regenerative braking will not return a lot of the power to the cells"
[deleted]
What's quite amazing is that it wasn't correct the first time
"It means the electronic brakes aren't strong enough by themselves, which doesn't mean that much if the friction brakes can do that job."
I think the real question is am I happy that what happens when I hit the brakes can be changed OTA. 
"Your 3-day old post is outdated because Chrysler just outdid themselves and everybody else combined with this:

[Fiat Chrysler recalls 5.3 million vehicles for cruise control defect]
(https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fiat-chrysler-recall/fiat-chrysler-recalls-4-8-million-u-s-vehicles-for-cruise-control-defect-idUSKCN1IQ1QY)"
"Not to discount Tesla’s response, but you know other cars have over-the-air updates right? "
"No ones hacking my Toyota remotely, it doesn’t even have WiFi."
all ABS is software
"Yes, they either need to get Tesla’s signing certificate or they need to find an exploit in the update mechanism itself.

The first has happened to Adobe, the latter has happened to Samsung and Microsoft (and others in both cases). These are not impossible scenarios."
"Mechanic here, a couple panic stops for practice (assuming they aren't brand new pads that haven't been worn in) will absolutely not cause abnormal wear and tear let alone any kind of damage. If anything it can help your pads and rotors bond to make certain they will work at peak performance in an actual emergency."
"The beauty of ABS is it still allows you to manoeuvre around an obstacle while heavy braking. Unfortunately, most people slam on the brakes, freeze, then don't manoeuvre around the object that is endangering them. It is worth while to practice panic stops and manoeuvreing in a place like an nice big empty car park."
Look at this guy with beater cars with ABS brakes. 
"I get your line of thinking, but rapid braking once or twice when getting used to/buying a new car won’t do enough wear and tear to either of those parts to amount to anything. If the one or two times you do it to learn about how your vehicle reacts causes enough damage to be worried, likely something was wrong before hand"
That's not how it works.
"The pads and rotors are designed to destroy slowly so you don't need to worry about long term damage.

The only thing that might happen is you hear them squeal a day sooner."
That's wrong.
"I totally agree with you. It's not like it makes any difference in the situation. We don't wait and measure ""okay applying full pressure now will stop me at the correct position"". It's more a thing of getting used to ABS to not be startled. And then, when a full stop as to be executed, probably no human being will be able to measure before the break when you will stop. You either stop in time or you don't. At the very least you've reduced the force of a potential crash significantly.

I mean, sure, those crazy idiots that deliberately drive towards a cliff to prove their, I don't know, ""manhood""(?) will have to know. But this is a sort of Schroedinger's Cat situation anyway. :D Irrelevant scenario."
"Exactly. First thing I do when we have snow is test my stopping distance and get a feel for how the car handles.

Whenever I tell that to people they think I'm crazy and/or an irresponsible, reckless driver. smh."
We did it on a track and it was very enlightening. Made me a much more confident driver to know what the limits of the car are.
"For us in Germany it's mandatory. It's part of the list of things, like night driving, highway, city, that you have to do. If you haven't done it, you can't do the final test.

Or... let's just say, I hope it's still the case. I've been driving for about 14 years. Don't know if anything as changed."
"Whats scarier is that this is actually common to ABS systems in all modern cars. Most ABS systems, as i understand it, can be modified and adjusted. Teslas can just be modified OTA. :)"
"I agree; and 20 feet in a braking test is a **really long distance**. On most cars, braking distance is limited by the tires more than by the brakes. For Tesla to leave 20 feet on the table, when the calculations for expected braking distance are well known, is.... bad. 

An average car is about 15 feet long. So if you're in a model 3 and just barely stop in time to avoid a wreck; before the change you'd go through the car in front of you, plus another 5 feet. Of course the impact to the car in front would reduce that travel distance, but it really shows just how much of a difference that is.

That being said, the Model 3's braking distance is still a lot better than its competitors, both before and after the update."

"True, but the ABS has full authority to release pressure to stop wheel lock. If the ABS reduces pressure too much it will reduce the braking effort."
I thought the Tesla had the Bosch iBooster instead of traditional MC.
"Do you drive a car with ABS?  All ABS systems are, at their core, controlled by some kind of software.

The difference here is that Tesla has an easy way to flash that ABS firmware through their connected systems."
Most fighter jets in the last what 50 years are like this. Pilot tells the plane about where they want to go and the computers maneuver dozens of mechanical things to get the plane to do desired stuff. 
"Yep. In today's world of automotive computers, the challenge is maintaining the illusion that you are in control of your vehicle. Some cars are better at it than others."
"According to Elon’s tweet he doesn’t even know about it not connecting to WiFi, I expect it that to change quicker now. "
Firmware is OTA (Over The Air) via LTE on the Model 3 or LTE/WiFi on the Model S/X. The only caveat being the Model 3 *can* do a WiFi connection at Service Centers. The uncorking update was a unique circumstance. 
"You're right. I looked up the weight thinking that this difference was rather large and they even weigh the same.

I'd like to know how they perform in the realworld (not repeated stops) but am too lazy to look it up"

Takata airbags have been recalled twice on my Honda fit a year apart... So apparently the driver's side was killing people so they fixed that last year but didn't check the passenger side for some ungodly reason so until I got the letter last week I have been driving my wife and kids in a death trap. I would say this isn't uncommon it's just big because it's Tesla.
"Sounds like a braking performance thing under specific conditions. It's not that the breaks failed, they just weren't operating as well as they could in a given situation. Think of it as finding a minor exploit in a game that got patched."
They did test the brakes...
Your understanding of the issue is shallow
"Mercedes just had a 600,000 car recall due to emissions cheating, and BMW a 300,000 car recall due to engine stalling.

Defects happen."
So OTA updates are a bad thing now and rest of automakers are doing a great job by asking thousand's of $ for doing them via cable? 
What happens when other automakers have the updates? Shouldn’t Tesla be prepping and ensuring their cars are better even if this becomes the case?
So the software update that my 2014 Acura just required to fix a stalling transmission issue was Tesla's fault? The one they didn't even notify me about until I went in and then tried to charge me for?

"That's the result of the bug, not the cause. So it's not an edge case, it's not a case at all."
"Yes.  I don't know about you, but I haven't slammed on the brakes from highway speed to stop in the entire 20 years I've been driving.  That it did this fine the first time but had ""problems"" (stopping in a distance that is normal for an SUV) doing this more than once in a day means that this is very decidedly an edge case.  Would generously affect a few dozen hard breaking events a year and could easily not affect a single outcome.  But the shallow ones just bleat ""MODEL 3 CAN'T BRAKE YOU'RE ALL CRAZY TO DRIVE ONE OMG CASH BURN TESLA'S GONNA FAIL"""

"There's nothing unusual about the Model 3's braking system.  It's a simple hydraulic system that can be actuated either mechanically or electrically, combined with an ABS pump/modulator unit."
That's correct but every car can be updated. The only new thing is that the tool that usually is connected by the mechanic to update the car now is included with the car.
And fight back against consumer lawsuits despite being in the wrong.

I don't trust their OTA updates
But what did we just give up? What was the reason for the original behavior? I must assume there was a good reason.
It's not really a CR test. It's an SAE test. 
"It would be somewhat reasonable for them to not want the driver to use it at 100% every time. Repeated emergency stops can cause glazing on the brake disks, which makes them a bit less effective at emergency stops for a while (until the glazing wears off), but that's rarely an issue - and may not be an issue at all when the regen absorbs much of the energy. That's the only good reason I can think of. And the only bad reason I can think of is to 'condition' the driver to expect less safety margin, or to keep the brakes in the optimal temperature range (perhaps so the autopilot would be able to use them at full force, but the driver couldn't). But those are very, very bad reasons. Tesla says that the driver is the ultimate controller of the vehicle, so it would be ridiculous for them to take some braking ability away from the driver - though I wouldn't be surprised if they did that.

In light of the massive failure of Uber's autopilot system recently, Tesla's handful of autopilot problems, and the fact that there is a lot of cross-pollination of ideas between these companies, I don't have much trust in the autopilot systems."
Increase brake life?
Ditto!
"See my reply to cold leadership above.  As long as the benefits exceed the problems, it's worth it."
"as long as they are tested following accepted industry standards then there shouldn't be any difference whether it is an OTA update or not. I'm not sure how rigorous brake testing normally is. I would imagine you could test 10 different vehicles in wet, icy, dry, cold, hot etc conditions at 5-10 different speeds and that may be enough. But I really don't know. I do assume that they test these things to a standard though, and they would do that every time they update the software."
"sure, that's what I would expect."
"‘‘Twas an attempt at humor back. :)

Minus 50 feet instead of 130 feet total, because it would proactively stop before a human even saw the danger. "
">  I guess my point was that BAS does not provide optimal braking and given the advances in technology since ABS was developed it is surprising that better technology hasn't been utilized.

Yeah, although it's less surprising if you consider the various legal and regulatory consequences of anything smarter. The advantage of ABS is exactly its main weakness as well: simplicity.

Another argument to make here is that stopping distance is not necessarily the most important factor in the majority of near-accident situations, as the most important crash-avoidance tool in a car are not the brakes, but the *steering wheel*: and ABS is very good at avoiding wheel slippage in a very wide spectrum of circumstances - which still keeps the car steerable.

All of that makes it a very hard decision to potentially improve overall braking performance while degrading steering control authority much more in some boundary conditions...

What manufacturers have done, including Tesla, is to utilize the braking system to improve overall traction: braking an overspeeding wheel down so that it approaches surface velocity again. That situation is a demonstrably valid situation where braking helps unconditionally and improves overall steering control authority.
"
Then you misunderstood. He didn’t have a meltdown.
"Facts.  ConsumerReports conducted a brake test no one else has replicated.  They held back the info for their release date and only gave tesla couple of days notice.

They put people at risk for the shock value of releasing their report.  No one should trust an organization like that.

They also put out a recommendation to not buy the model 3, but they were testing an older revision and had no idea if the current revision being sold even had the same problem.  Tesla doesn't use consistent model years, you must receive a car and test it really fast to have any chance at putting out a review that isn't invalidated.

Their report glossed over that the first brake test was fine and only a subsequent had a problem.  That is a totally different thing than all tests failing.  They did nothing to point out revision changes or even make it known that tesla updates anything at any time.

Its a trash report, plain and simple.  When they released it, they had no idea if the report even applied anymore, but still told people not to buy."
"It came off poorly to you, yet you yourself write in this way after a tiny bit of criticism? So many people really need to look at themselves in the mirror... And this is the kind of hypocrisy Elon has to deal with all the time. "
"Apple throttled the speed of the CPU so it didn’t shut down from excessive power consumption.  Most people would prefer a phone that stays on rather than one that shuts down abruptly, particularly in colder climates. 

The real thing Apple should have done is a recall on the batteries or a cheap replacement program, which they ultimately did. 

Also, that’s not planned obsolescence.

The rest of your post, I don’t see how it follows. It seems to be rant and somewhat incoherent. (No worries, I get that way often.) Oh, perhaps you are speaking English as a second language? It’s likely much better than I could speak yours. Could you please elaborate on what you mean?"
"It definitely reduces stopping distance. Without it, the car would skid."
"You are right. This one is better:

But depending on the quality of the ABS implementation professional drivers are able to beat it as not all implementations are that great."
"Yes. ""If"". Looking forward to the retest..."
It's certainly a very interesting question.
"That Chrysler one, holy shit. What cracks me up... It's a software fix. "

Reneger this is the same company that choose not to fix their ignition problem because it cost less to pay the wrongful death suits.
Impossible other automakers test these things befor releasing cars unlike Tesla or something... !!!!
Would love to know if other manufacturer OTA updates touch driving mechanics and not just infotainment.
[This article](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/07/gm-to-offer-ota-software-updates-before-2020-but-only-for-a-new-infotainment-platform/) is nearly a year old but at the time GM and Ford couldn't legally push OTA updates because of agreements with dealerships.
I'm pretty sure 90% of the cars on the road right now do not have such thing.
" Plenty will update infotainment, Who updates vehicle control software today?"
"Depends on your definition of ""remotely""

Some police cruisers were found to be able to unlock them through the tire pressure monitors.

It's not out of the realm of possibility that something like an exploit with your keyfob could allow hacks from a close-ish distance."

"Fuel injection, steering, airbags?"
ABS in most cars is not connected to any online updating system.
Very rudimentary software

Never thought of it that way.  I guess in most situations I would be slamming on brakes because I can't manoeuvre out of the way.  In some situations I'd want to do both.

"I've driven a few different beater cars, and some nicer cars too, from various model years. I've never driven in a vehicle without abs before."
But knowing how far it actually takes you to stop may cause you to follow at safer distances and stuff.
"As someone who lives in a country where you actually have quite strict requirements for a license and you have to take a mandatory number of lessons that cover a lot of stuff, US driving tests are quite amusing. Tho not quite as amusing as some other places like India."
There’s nothing scary about including the ability to update software. It would be weird not to.
">That being said, the Model 3's braking distance is still a lot better than its competitors, both before and after the update.

What are you going on about? Before the update it lost to the F-150 and after it's decent but average. "
"What are the numbers? If it was already a lot better, why did https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/998777288559755264 say ""Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car""?"
brake.exe has encountered an unknown error and has stopped unexpectedly.
probably .lib
That is correct.
The iBooster uses an electric motor instead of traditional ICE vacuum to increase force but it still has a [push rod input from the pedal and a standard tandem master cylinder](https://www.bosch-mobility-solutions.com/media/global/products-and-services/passenger-cars-and-light-commercial-vehicles/driving-safety-systems/brake-booster/ibooster/product_data_sheet_ibooster.pdf) the point is it’s not “brake by wire”.
"Yes, but braking is still not a suggestion. Even if the power brakes fail, I still can push hard enough to brake.

I don't want anyone to flash my ABS software over the air. If Tesla can't figure out ABS by now, that's just scary."
"ABS can fluctuate brake pressures, but ultimately you are still directly in some control of the system pressure. The new electric and hybrid cars are all E-boosted instead of vacuum boosted. This means the pedal still controls some hydraulic fluid, but it is mostly for feedback feeling and a secondary analog signal to the braking computer. The pedal pressure is the suggestion, in addition to a pedal position sensor. Now that said, if E-boost power is lost then you still have the suggestive pressure from the pedal that will stop the car *eventually*, but it will be worse than any unassisted vacuum system."
"Fighter jets go through way more tests than cars. On the Tesla, we're the test pilots it seems"
"Elon's inner monologue: ""AHHH!! This is why the stock price was going down! All should be fine now."""
"Cadillac/GM has spent some serious money on the alpha platform that the Cadillac CTS, ATS and Camaro all share. That chassis is world class, the Camaro ZL1 1le is putting down track times that are embarrassing +6 figure super cars. If Tesla would get some chassis engineers like GM has brought in for their performance versions they would not only dominate the dragstrip but the road courses also. 

It's a great time to be a car enthusiast and I'm definitely keeping my eye on Tesla, a new model 3 performance version or used model S performance version (probably a P85D) are on my list for a new toy as soon as my wife's Denali is paid off."
Defiantly right.
Now their really going to be confused.
I see what you did their.
It’s Elon’s fault that people spread lies about him because he complains when people spread lies about him? That’s basically the equivalent of saying that a bullying victim brings it on himself by not ignoring his bullies.
"While that's horrible, it's also a lot harder to test what happens to airbags in a vehicle collision because you need to sacrifice a car each time you do a full test. Brakes can be tested many many times on the same car."
"The takata recalls are staged due to the time it takes to manufacture that many airbags. The airbags fail with age depending on the temperatures they are exposed to, and they probably figured that the driver's side airbags were exposed to more heat being installed in the relatively exposed steering wheel, compared to the passenger-side ones that are embedded in the dash, so they prioritized manufacturing driver's side ones."
"Isn't everything that happens under specific conditions? It's not even under unusual conditions. Why did CR have the minds capable of envisioning this test, but Tesla did not?"
"In some ways, yes."
Then please share your deeper understanding.

"Thing is, any car manufacturer can do OTA updates. Tesla isn't doing anything crazy or impressive. Not sure why other manufacturers aren't doing the same though. Probably because it doesn't fit their business model. "
Downvote for breaking
"This wasn't an issue of rebalancing, or of figuring out something new. ABS is known, electric generators are known. This was of an inconsistency in performance, caused by something inconsistent in the software (and we know it's a software issue, because it was fixed by a software patch). 

For software, an inconsistent result is a big red flag that something is wrong. Unit testing should have identified that - because unit testing is supposed to cover the full range of situations that each component will encounter. At least, when such testing is properly implemented it will - though it's rarely implemented that well."
Regen is suspended if ABS is engaged
While technically correct in practical matters this is bullshit. Traditional car companies operate on the model that you need to buy the latest model to get the latest software and driver assist stuff they offer. Tesla puts a lot of effort into pushing their latest software improvements to their older cars.
Go to audi and ask them to update to latest maps in you navigation. You will be charged for it. Shame
I don't trust other manufacturers lack of OTA updates.
Efficiency is my best guess. Limiting the braking power so more energy is captured by regen extending range.
True....but multiple panic stops in a row are not a real worlds use case. Even on a race track you don't apply the brakes in this manner. 
"So much salt...

They bought the first Model 3 they could, followed the same process used for every other car and truck they test and the Model 3 didn't make the cut. Why should Tesla be treated any differently?

"|tiny bit of criticism

Sure, being accused of being a robot, getting called a corporate shill, being told my opinion is not valid is a 'tiny' bit of criticism. More and more I'm seeing people on this sub act like people over on TD. Musk, for all of the cool shit he's doing, has serious flaws. He's doing great things, but he's not God. I think it's only a good thing to point them out on a sub that he frequents to show that he needs to step up his game. I started off absolutely loving the guy because he was automating car creation to a level we haven't seen before. He helps run SpaceX which has reusable rockets. How cool is that? But then I hear reports about how underpaid his staffers are, and they're being forced to work insane (and unhealthy hours) on top of it. That puts a bad taste in my mouth. Progress is great, but it shouldn't be on the back of over-worked, under-paid people. 

So what hypocrisy were you referring to again?"
"In the majority of dry conditions, ABS can certainly decrease stopping distances. Proper threshold braking will beat ABS in stopping distances (Though it's not really applicable in 99.9% of cases). But in wet or loose conditions, ABS can increase stopping distances but will be much more stable. 

I guess my point is that ABS was never really meant for shortening stopping distances. It's intended to maintain the stability and steering capabilities of the vehicle in hard braking. "
"Not always: https://image.slidesharecdn.com/anti-lockbrakingsystemabspresentation-141026091524-conversion-gate02/95/anti-lock-braking-systemabs-by-arshad-habib-khan-14-638.jpg?cb=1414315896

Maybe it's better for ABS nowadays."
That's missing the point of ABS. Its purpose is not so much to decrease braking distance as it is to keep the car under control and manoeuvrable during heavy braking.
"Most ABS systems lock up at speeds below 25-30 kph, but I once drove an Opel Meriva which almost sent me off a super slippery parking lot at 10-15kph because it refused to lock up. Incidentally one of the worst modern cars I’ve driven. 

When I took my winter driving course at a track when I was 17 we were able to outperform ABS by about 20m (aprox. 30%). The conditions were slush on ice; conditions were ABS don’t fare well. Intermittently locking the wheel until the car started to rotate, release, regain control and repeat was the most effective solution in those conditions. Considering this, and all the time I spend driving on winter roads here in Norway I’ve never really encountered any situations (except for the Meriva) in which I would have been better off without it. Sure, humans can brake better when we’re prepared for it, but emergency braking is exactly the opposite. You’re much more likely to lock up for too long before letting go, than to do a perfect job. "
It's not a fix they modified the software to avoid the short. I am surprised that it does not compromise any feature. 
This shows why “runaway cars” are a myth and the result of people slamming on the gas when they think they are pushing the brake.  
"Good point, I’m admittedly not familiar with what’s actually included in their updates. It’s possible they’re primarily consumer facing. "
"Right… because most cars on the road aren’t new. I think it’s safe to say however that most recent cars would not have required a recall for this exact same issue. 

Tesla is however in a unique position of having their entire fleet (effectively at least) using OTA updates. "
I’m definitely considering remotely to be “via the internet”.
If only hackable cars are modern then meh
I have manual air bag in my car. You gotta stop and blow it up before you get in a wreck but other than that it's pretty good
"wow, you should be a journalist the way you took one statement about not wanting to put unnecessary wear/damage on the brakes and spun it around with the headline ""Tesla owners scared to brake hard, endangering people and children"""
"Please don't project your fears onto others. If you know how ABS works and the need to break hard arises, almost everybody will break hard, no matter the car. It's by instinct. Even people on the passenger seat do the motion. It's not something you think about. The only factor there is, if you, consciously or subconsciously, recognise the situation as being dangerous. But that is a whole different debate and has absolutely nothing to do with the car you sit in... Well, maybe unless you're sitting in a tank and couldn't care less. Then again, I don't consider a tank to be a car. ;)"
"I think the original commenter was just referring to brake wear on any car, for which the mechanic provided an opinion against. "
Lmao
[deleted]
Not really scared but service center is 3 hours away.  It's not likely to cause any damage but not point in risking it.
"Probably a coincidence. Unless something was very wrong to begin with, a panic stop shouldn't toast your brakes. "
"Norway. Am Norwegian, spent a good few hours in drivers' ed driving on a slippery track and emergency braking and the like. Really insightful."
Yes and no
Abs became mandatory on everything in the EU in 2004 and everything in north america in 2013 but it's been a pretty common option on anything that wasn't the cheapest of the cheap since at least the 90's.   I think the last car I had without abs was an 86.  my 91's both had it.
"The actual driving test is pretty laughable, but drivers ed is something that you have to take in most states if you are under 18 and it's pretty stringent. In my state you have to take 24 hours worth of classes, then you have 4 actual driving lessons that are 2 hours each. Normal Driving, Night Driving, Highway Driving and then whatever else you need to work on. Still have some terrible drivers though. "
Maybe its not scary if you believe that its 100% secure and nothing bad could possibly ever happen. Theres no such thing as an invulnerable system.

">  If Tesla can't figure out ABS by now, that's just scary.

You mean like Harley Davidson, Hyundai or VW, who have all had recent ABS recalls?  All of which were arguably more serious as they involved actual mechanical failures?

Like it or not, motor vehicles are very complex systems.  Yes, it'd undoubtedly be better if this weren't an issue in the first place.  No one should argue that.  In this case, they can address the issue quickly and without depending on people bringing their car into a dealer to address it, which seems like the best outcome if there was an issue to begin with."
Planes require more testing due to a power loss means a giant rock falls from the side vs rolls to the side of the road. 
"More like: ""God dammit, what middle manager was responsible for this"""
Where loosing it here
"Meh, I could care less."
The airbags weren't failing they were projecting metal shards into people upon impact. This also was not staged it was a completely different recall. If you have a link to show what you are talking about I would appreciate it.
Likely because Tesla as an organization is missing tens of thousands of hours of invaluable industry and development knowledge.
"The first CR 60-0 stop was consistent with Tesla's internal testing that showed ~130 stopping distance.  Note that Tesla did do internal testing.  The first 70mph stop by Car and Driver showed good stopping distance which outperformed all other EV's.  Independent testing from 25mph showed superior stopping power.  All criticisms of Model 3 braking have showed that the first emergency braking stop from highway speed was quite good.  The problem seems to be with how a hard stop like this affected the ABS's programmed performance.  Most people go their whole lives without panic braking from highway speeds to stopped.  Tesla does do internal testing of braking.  This was one edge case.  ""How well does Model 3 brake"" is much more complicated than the one issue identified by CR, and Model 3 is not some outlier with regards to overall braking performance."
"> Thing is, any car manufacturer can do OTA updates.

Any car manufacturer COULD do OTA updates, but cannot currently without designing it into the car.

> Tesla isn't doing anything crazy or impressive.

It's unprecedented in the car industry, regardless if its not crazy or unimpressive.

> Not sure why other manufacturers aren't doing the same though. Probably because it doesn't fit their business model.

Several reasons. One of the major ones is the dealership model as the dealerships make a lot of profit on servicing vehicles and updating software when you come in for service. If the car manufacturers did do over the air updates then the dealers might sue."
"Unit tests help you find inconsistencies between software revisions. They test that an isolated software unit works the same as it did when you wrote the test, and not that it works correctly.

Functional tests can help with this sort of problem, as long as you know what conditions to test for, and what result to expect.

This just sounds like CR were braking in a different way, under different conditions which hadn't been accounted for."
"Many people don't know that their cars get Softwareupdates when they bring the car into service. These updates sometimes bring small improvements but usually are just small bug fixes.  
But yes generally you're not getting improvements or changes over time with your traditional car manufacturer. It's a you get what you see purchase while with Tesla you're getting improvements over time. This can be seen as something good but in some cases it feels like the video game industry. A traditional OEM would have never offered a car without rain sensing wipers while saying ""yeah that will be delivered at a later date via OTA"". "
"If we're talking about new features, you're correct. But in terms of fixes like this one, they're always applied to the affected cars ."

Really? You would trust OTA updates that mess with your brakes from any car manufacturer? Which one?
"It can happen in the real world so it is a real world use case.  
And CR even waited for a day to see if this only occurs when the emergency braking is done multiple times in a short period of time. The results stayed bad. And I don't know about your car but mine had to do a few emergency brakes in its life. "
"Haha, I canceled my model 3 reservation.  Tesla has too many issues for someone who doesn't treat $50k as weekend spending cash.

I am going to criticism CR for their actual faults.  They had a video on youtube, right up front they said the tesla takes 153ft to stop.  About 6.5min in they casually mention some tests worked as expected around 130ft.  

They are purposely reporting this in an obfuscated way to get more publicity.  Meanwhile the fact that tesa fixes this so fast via software does mean CR deserves criticism for sitting on this issue.

I don't know what you are smoking, but this is what is happening now that CR is ad based and not membership based.  They must act like a blog, not a responsible organization.

>Except Car&Driver experienced the same problem.

You mean recreated after seeing the CR report.  Also, I love how they just call it ""heat-induced fade"".  I would love for any of these companies to do a brake inspection and explain why instead of using vague terms.  Hell, the CR report claimed heat had nothing to do with it because they waited until the next day.  Is this brake glazing or an issue with applied brake pressure?  No one seems to be offering real info.

Your car&driver could at least say how much time between stops, a simple list of the stops, distances, and timestamps would be useful as well as the received date of their tesla, do they have one from august, or 2 weeks ago?"
"Absolutely tiny compared with the nefarious world wide coverage that Elon gets in the press as well as twitter but none of his tweets were as bad as yours - which was far more like a meltdown. I would call that hypocrisy - you judge him to a different standard to yourself. 

Everyone has flaws - but you just slagged him off for when the guy, like millions of other people including me, is really fed up with how the press works these days - not just for him, but about everything - and it seems just because you don't get it, you can insult him in public. 

You then go on to insult everyone who sees it differently than you as seeing him as a god, when most people can see the bigger picture but aren't hypocritical enough to tell one of the most successful guys in the world to, ""up his game"". Just because people defend someone against totally unjust criticism doesn't mean they think that person is perfect. 

I don't know much about his employment standards and don't see it as my business - I do know that I wouldn't want to work for him nor anyone that driven as they often expect you to be like them. But that is not even relevant here.

I have read all his tweets, and they seem to reflect an intelligent guy who is justified in being pissed off, and looking to find a way to do something about an international problem. I applaud what he's doing, to me it's the powerful guys who do nothing that need to up their game. And the number of people like you who just don't get the issue is staggering.

If you don't think Elon is allowed to point out the flaws of the press, and give ""salty"" replies to insulting tweets, but think you can do both whether it's justified and proportionate or not, then THAT is hypocrisy. "
"Sure, early ABS systems were quite basic, but modern cars with ESP have things like steering angle sensors to determine if you are actually making a turn or not. Braking force could easily be modulated to adjust for steering angle. 

Also, the point of ABS is to increase safety, this includes both braking distance and and maneuverability. It’s nice for cars, but imagine 18-wheelers without ABS. "
True but it should not come at the cost of losing too much stopping power. As maximum braking force is achieved with a non-locked wheel anyway(apart from soft snow or sand)

You'll just going to have to wait for a dangerous situation requiring hard braking to discover how your car reacts in such situations. Sounds like a much better strategy than risking a 3 hour drive for a repair that will be under warranty. 
"Same in Denmark. The whole thing was like 5\-6 \(including a break\) hours with wet track controlling a drifing car, controlled swerving, how to recover if one set of wheels go off road \(aka how not to oversteer\), and emergency braking."
Thanks for the insightful comment!
I had a '07 without ABS. Good ol' Ford!
"Fun fact, ABS isn’t actually technically mandatory in the US. 

Electronic Stability Control, which requires ABS to function, is however. "
Tesla has a good record though.

"https://www.nhtsa.gov/takata-air-bags/takata-recall-expansion-what-consumers-need-know

>The combination of time, temperature fluctuations, and humidity contribute to the breakdown of the PSAN propellant in the inflators. This breakdown can cause the propellant to burn too quickly, which creates more pressure than the inflator can withstand. In extreme cases, this causes the inflator to explode and send shrapnel through the air bag toward vehicle occupants.

> After consultation with the affected vehicle manufacturers and Takata, NHTSA prioritized the recall of non-desiccated PSAN air bag inflators based on the risk of injury or death to vehicle occupants. As the chart below shows, recalls are phased by the location and age of the vehicles. This schedule is designed to ensure that vehicles are recalled before the propellant in the inflators breaks down to the point of becoming dangerous. The phased recalls began in May 2016 and will continue through December 2019.

Also because Tesla skipped testing and went straight to production because they knew better than the tens of thousands of hours of invaluable industry and development knowledge they were missing. 
"Thanks, but I understood the facts. You haven't added anything other than spin."

>Meanwhile the fact that tesla fixes this so fast via software does mean CR deserves criticism for sitting on this issue.

You keep saying they sat on the report, where you getting that? And the fact that Tesla had a fix ready to go in days says more about what Tesla knew beforehand.

>Is this brake glazing or an issue with applied brake pressure? No one seems to be offering real info.

Wouldn't that be on Tesla to explain?

>You mean recreated after seeing the CR report.

From Car & Driver's report in April...

"The map updates are ota. The free updates is a recent change they added with the new infotainment system on the A8 and A6.

Not rigorously tested since Tesla can just do another OTA update
"That's good. But many people don't drive defensive.  
The emergency braking situations I've had untill now usuay were absolutely necessary and not really avoidable with defensive driving.

"This is cute.  Its right on wikipedia.  They just claim they are insulated, so its ok.  Look at what they did to the consumerist, the bought it just to shut it down.  It was hurting their subscriptions.

>Wouldn't that be on Tesla to explain?

Sure, except what if changing the brake pads was the fix, consumers can do that on their own pretty easily.  What is the point in doing the test, skipping a 5 min brake inspection, and telling people not to buy the new version of the car you reviewed?  It just gets stupid. 

In the end, CR sat on info tesla could have used to fix the car at any time so they could publish it in their magazine.  That is fucked up.

They litterally had no problem risking people's lives.

>And the fact that Tesla had a fix ready to go in days says more about what Tesla knew beforehand.

No it does not.  It shows how fast they could fix this once they knew about it.  Stop inventing fake shit.

Who cares what the fix is or was. If it doesn't work when it rolls off the dealers lot it doesn't work and saying they could recommend the car, but oh yeah replace the brake pads first is next level stupid.

>CR sat on info tesla could have used to fix the car at any time

It's like I'm talking to a wall here, how did they sit on anything? They got the car, they tested, they notified Tesla, they published. What are going on about? Time to cite a source.

>They litterally had no problem risking people's lives.

The only people risking lives was Tesla releasing a car that wasn't fully tested.

Eli5 why? This will be my first car ever I don’t want to mess any simple things up. Also should I get it wrapped?
Yes
Why would you tint a tinted roof?
"Allegedly because the roof is covered in some kind of coating that reflects infrared waves to prevent inside from heating up too much. Water, however, changes optical properties of that layer, making it reflect visible light."
I used a special 3M tint in my car that causes this exact effect.  I was told it’s the same tint used in spaceships so that’s pretty cool.  I could also be lying about all of this. 
"[Dichromatic Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichromatic_mirror).  It's a layered tint that acts as a mirror for invisible wavelengths of light and helps decrease how hot it would get inside the car.  It's normally invisible so the roof just looks like dark tinted glass because the invisible light is reflected away from the car and remains invisible, but when it rains the water slows down the light ever so slightly, bringing it into the visible spectrum a little bit and giving the glass the appearance of a new color."
Take a picture at sunset and boost the saturation

Here’s some more in its original quality. "
It’s fun to enjoy the details
"Because it’s generally a sign you look after your car. Most beading like this occurs when a cars paint has been freshly polished, waxed or sealed with a protective coating, all of which indicates the owner generally looks after their car by properly tending to the paint.
Furthermore, water that beads like this runs off the surface of your car much easier and is easier to see through.
When this occurs on the sunroof of a Tesla vehicle, the beads adopt a unique feature wherein they absorb the light reflected by the sunroofs IR coating."
Dragonscale... 
i kind of agree of with you. It creeps me out just a little.
I think he was being sarcastic. Granted if you can store your car in a garage it's best to but it won't hurt much to leave it out in the rain.
Water melts the Model 3
"/r/autodetailing

Get a good wax or a sealant and you’ll be alright "
Just being facetious.
Best first car ever!!
Does it need to be waxed?
"From what I’ve seen online. 

1 - you live somewhere hot and people would want that extra preventive layer

2 - tint consistency. People are tinting the whole back glass so they don’t have a silly tint line half way up. If they’re tinting all the glass except the sunroof you’ll notice a difference inside. "
Phoenix
"But this is the internet, everything is true! "
What is the tint called?  I'd like to add this to my side windows.
"If it was any company besides 3M, I would have called bullshit.

However, this is 3M we're talking about, which makes it pretty likely."
"So how would one be able to keep this ""bead like"" droplets for their all glass roof in years time? Would they need to apply some type of water resistant coating?"
have you ever seen a dragon?  🤔🤔🤔🤔
Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid?
It's not the coating that creates the shapes though it's our reality and physics. That's more amazing than creepy
The garage is full of bikes and a workout section so no car space 😭. I hadn’t thought about it till just now but won’t things like acidic rain and water stains fuck up the paint?
Haven't had it long enough to find out. My guess is some sort of sealant will help in creating the defined water beads. The top of the glass (without water) has a redish color to it so I imagine the sunset effect will remain.
"Not sure what it’s called but your local 3M window tint installer should know.  
For some reason it only causes this effect in the rear window, not the sides.  
"
"Yep. You can get a paint coating applied by most detailers that acts like an extra layer on top of the clear coat. Mind you, they’re not cheap. To have a whole car coated in a standard nano-ceramic coating will set you back $500ish and that’s at the cheaper end of the range not including prep work.
It’s something you’d need to talk to a detailer about because you can’t just go and apply one of these coatings without preparing the surface first, you need to decontaminate the clear coat and then polish the surface to a uniform finish. 
These coatings however can last from 1 year for the cheaper solutions, all the way up to 5 or more depending on what you have done."
"Game of thrones? Seriously how many times do we need to see these? 3 owners are posting them every other day. It’s nothing new and the model X already had them, 2 years ago."

No not really.

"Got “CQuartz” applied to my pearl white S85 right after delivery. That was May of 2014. It’s still working great! A run through a rain shower rinses off all the dust and pollen, and I have a Shiny New Car again :)  

It doesn’t give it magic rainbow glass effect though. Just keeps everything from getting to the paint."
Oh dang
Temporary crisis averted thanks 👍
"You could also just wax it and get the same effect, or apply a ceramic coating yourself, or any number of other sealants. IDK why that dude just jumped to a $500 dealer applied product. "

"In Slovenia there's 1 year maternity leave (which can be aplit between both parents, just not for the first 3 months), if the mother is unemployed she gets some money instead (a few hundred €), and there's also a paid father's leave during and after maternity leave, I think it's 30 days or so, paid by the government. Of course you get your job back later. The company would be in hige trouble if they fired you for taking a maternity leave. 

Kinder garden is also subsidized (depends on families income), and you get child bonus monthly until they're 15 or 18 or something (the amount again depends on families income).

And the birth and hospital stay costs nothing. My wife was in the hospital for 3 weeks because my son was in ICU for a while, and it didn't cost us anything.

I can't imagine recieving a 30000€ bill for the ICU or something like that, I don't even make that much in a year, it would have completely destroyed us financially for years.

"US is more of a capitalist state so we pay (generally) lower taxes but must pay for a lot of these things out of pocket and dont get as many bennies.    Many European countries are more socialist-leaning so higher tax rates (sometimes much higher, like 40-50%) but you get all these bennies and safety nets."
"The US has or had because I think it was just nixed in the tax reform bill. A child tax credit. So you got some of your taxes back at the end of the year. If you do the math, over a year kindergeld is about the same as the child tax credit."

"Healthcare is for **everyone here legally enough to work**. I pay about 15% total my employer pays 7.5% and I pay the other 7.5%. because my wife doesnt work right now she is automatically covered.

In terms of % income in the states for coverage for my wife and I. I was paying 5% of my income in premiums and when we were planning out having a child we were looking at another 3% of my income in out of pocket and copays for having a child.

So I will pay another 2% all the time to not have to pay another co-pay or see another hospital bill for my family and I."
"But that's the point, to encourage people to have more children. So the most optimal economic route would be to have children, to get back some of those taxes."
"Well yeah; I pay about 15% total my employer pays 7.5% and I pay the other 7.5%. because my wife doesnt work right now she is automatically covered.

Means we need to stop voting for one of the parties. Guess which one. 
It’s not something you wanna fix. It makes it much more likely for companies to hirer men. Allowing someone to take off a year from their job and guarantee they have it back is really not good for business. That’s why the tech industry for example sucks in Canada compared to the US. Companies don’t want to have to deal with those crazy laws.

"California actually grants paid time. You should look into it. Assuming you’re from here, that is. "
European here - couldn't imagine anything less than 4 weeks paid leave every year + health insurance + 6 months paid vacation for baby (which you can split between the parents). 
That makes the civil rights law of Thailand better than USA.

"I belive you are paying ALOT more ""effective"" tax than us in Europe. It’s just not called tax.
It’s called: Tuition. Daycare fee. Nursing home bill. Healthcare. 
These are things covered by our taxes in Europe. "
"Nope, the insane healthcare prices in the U.S. Is part of the taxes. It's the too stupid to vote for my own interest tax.

Us healthcare costs more than most places for not better outcomes. Women's health and child mortality is shit tier, bad third world level bullshit. "
That's not the point. The point is that a wealthy country has a moral obligation to look after its people. One of the basic reasons for society to exist is to help raise children. A rich country that doesn't have universal healthcare and parental leave for its citizens is bizarre to me.
Having more children is the worst thing you can possibly do for the environment though.

"No, I didn't say that. I do long for the standard of living, but not the atomic-era social norms. "
"Yeah no one earns 70k. Average monthly salary is 1670€ before tax or 1083€ after tax. I get 1950 before tax. The after tax salary depends, mostly if you have children (you get some tax return for each child until they're 18).

The one you disagree with?
"A) The leave is typically for the primary carer, which can be the father or the mother (or they can alternate), with a smaller pool of leave for the secondary carer. It's paid by the government, not the company. You don't know what you're talking about.

B) If you think having someone with almost full context and training come back to your business after a year is not good for business, you must never have worked in a management role.

C) The tech industry in America specifically adds perks like parental leave to attract the best talent. They voluntarily implement 'those crazy laws' because having someone with deep knowledge of your product bounce to a competitor after a year because of your short sightedness is 'not good for business'
"
"All of what you said is rubbish, exhibit a: Europe's economy is doing fine."
...except the tech industry in Canada is booming and parental leave is valid for either parent.
Well too fucking bad for companies. Know your worth and proceed.
The US companies happily outsource the IT work to Eastern Europe with the same social standards or even better ones. Many developers choose to work in the EU for this reason. 
"Except nearly every country in the western world has maternity leave like this and they don't experience problems like you describe. Always makes me laugh when it comes to conservative American beliefs, you use slippery slope arguments in place of readily available evidence. "

Microsoft used to give dads 4 weeks paid and 3 months for mothers.  Now its 3 months for dads and 6 for moms.  They also have a cute gift basket with similar things.  Really nice to see employers taking care of their workers.
"It’s better than 90 days - in Sweden parents get to share all but 180 days (90 reserved for each parent) so the family can work out what is best for them - if the best situation is that the father stays home and looks after the new baby then in theory he can take up to a year and a half off (not at full pay tho).

Me and my partner split the days so that she stayed home with out son till he was 1 year and now I’m taking 6 months off with him until he starts state funded childcare. 
"
"Yeah know what you mean, in the Netherlands, fathers only get 2 days. But we have a pretty good healthcare provided by the state to assist with the first week of parenthood. I was selfemployed (lucky) when I became father again last friday. So I control my own fate.

Do wish we had the same system here though.

I'm not going to acquiesce to sharing power between multiple parties just because. If one of those parties literally denies climate change, literally wants abstinence only and creationism in schools, literally thinks trickle down economics works, then I don't want them anywhere near the levers of power even if it means one party rule.

"Fellow Microsoft employee, can confirm. My boss is in the middle of his bonding time right now. Its pretty incredible when employers offer this for new dads. "

Intel does 8 weeks I believe currently.  No longer an employee there but when I was I had a few colleagues take that time after their child's birth.  Can be split up as well.
no god damn freedom over there...
So… you took out a week of vacation then. 
My company gives paid 6 weeks. The reason being that your contributions to the company's success should not impact your own personal goals such as starting a family. We also get paid 6 weeks sabbaticals every 6 years that can't be broken up on top of our PTO.

"Do you know what Tesla's published leave policy is?  If you remember, Elon made news a few years back for allegedly getting pissed at a guy missing an important work event for birth of his son.  Elon denied that, but the interested part is Tesla never publicly stated their leave policy which is curious.  "
Which is why employers are reluctant to give maternity leave.  IMO you should have to stay x number of years after you come back from leave or have to reimburse the employer.
"You do realize it's not a physical space issue, right? It's a resource issue. Saying we could squeeze everyone into a few square miles is meaningless."

Every gift card I’ve ever used has required the code on the back. They literally hang hundreds of these at the store with all their numbers exposed with the exception of the code on the back. I’m pretty sure it’s safe to post the front number.

"Usually 17 weeks in CA, so.. no. You’re wrong.

Here are your question marks back:

The way I see it's an investment. Parents work for a greater cause than non-parents.
"That six months ain't a vacation. My daughter just hit ten months the other day and my wife and I barely feel like we're starting to catch back up on sleeping a normal schedule. And all that's gonna be fucked to pieces with teething.  

Babies need to be fed all the time. Every 30-60 minutes, they need a diaper change. They want constant attention and entertainment. And you're the only source of all of these things. They determine when you go to bed and how long you sleep, and they don't give a shit that you have to be up at 5 for work the next morning. They need to be bathed and sometimes it's against their will. They need to be taught how to eat solid food, also sometimes against their will. (Never in mine or my wife's life did either of us ever anticipate that we'd volunteer to catch vomit in our bare hands, yet here we are.) And on top of all of this, you still need to find the time to take care of yourself too.  

That time off isn't a vacation. It's a learning period. Learning how to cope with the fact that nothing is going to go the way you've planned it for the rest of your life. Learning that you don't need to bring absolutely everything in the diaper bag every time you step out of the house. Learning that every bump, bruise, fall, cough, sneeze, and cry doesn't require a trip to the pediatrician. Learning how to teach this adorable little ball of strangeness how to do everything without really being able to communicate with it. And learning how to love your partner even when you've both had no sleep for a week, the baby is crying, you're hungry, your partner has to use the bathroom, the baby is crying, the bills are due, everyone in your family and all your friends want to come see the kid, and the baby is crying.  

That time off isn't a vacation, but Goddamn is it special."
Dis is true - I have to ask the government for permission to take a shit :(
"I received two weeks paid leave as the father. Mothers get six weeks paid leave at my company.   

It really depends on if you are salaried or an hourly employee ."
"What if your personal goals don’t include starting a family? Should you not just get the same PTO, multiplied by the average number of children per family, handed to you anyways? Otherwise that’d be incredibly unfair. Talk about subsidizing procreation!"
"That's fine - I have over a month paid in vacation plus other benefits that are negotiated into my employment contract. 

I was referring to the government mandated pay during leave, as per u/thehikingbadger 's post

Don't forget to downvote. "
Not the cunt that forces employers to pay people for doing nothing - absolutely. 
"45 days is not much.  Plus her salary is very low as she is Thai and their salaries suck.  With more time and better pay,  she would stay. For what she gets paid, she wouldn't make anything if we had to pay someone to take care of the baby while she worked. "
"The problem is that people's goals change in the course of caring for a child at home. A lot of people change their minds over that time, nobody properly anticipates what parenting will entail.

It's better to think of this more as a social contract thing. Our society is great and is aiming to achieve greater things, in exchange sometimes employers get screwed a little when a parent changes their mind. We shrug it off and keep moving.

Remember that the salary while off work is paid for by the government, not the employer. So the problems for the employer involve filling the labour gap during time off, and possibly reacting with short notice to a new parent not returning to work after that time.

Canada recently changed the law to change the time off from 12 months to 18 months (with no increase in income supplement, the extra 6 months is for job protection purposes only, if you want to learn the details, look it up). I have heard that many employers prefer this anyway because it's easier to fill an 18 month temp position than it is a 6 or 12 month temp position."
"3.54 million square miles of excess space provides a lot of resources.

Food is so cheap to produce in America that we burn our number one crop in our gas tanks. So cheap that we forced out sugar imports to give us an excuse to turn it into HFCS.

"They're typically activated at the register, at time of purchase, in addition to requiring the CVV."

they are far too similar for comfort. dont kid yourself. "
"I agree that women getting more bonding time than men is a relic of an era where they were the primary caretakers, but a decent portion of maternity leave (5-6 weeks) is for disability/physical recovery. Pushing out a baby (or having it cut out) takes a serious toll on the body."
Greater cause than themselves. They work for their children. 
"I'm certain it does as I've heard hiring managers discuss it at companies before. I'm at the baby age, but I do not want children, so I go out of my way to mention during interviews that I'm not interested in kids and would like to focus on my career. "

They didn't.

One party passed the Dodd Frank act. One party created the CFPB and gave it teeth. The other one put in a chief that isn't upholding that bureau's mission.

>btw this attitude is why the GOP evened the polls in 2018.

Is this attitude why moderate Democrats like Conor Lamb and Doug Jones were able to win in deep red +double digit Trump districts/states?

>so youre both stupid for not seeing it. and stupid for thinking this is good.

The attitude that ""both parties are the same"" is what kills the Democratic wave. It increases voter apathy. Why both voting if both parties are the same and it doesn't matter who you vote for?

**People like you are killing chances at a blue wave**. But why do you even care? According to you there's no difference between Republicans and Democrats. You don't even truly believe the shit you spew. You just say it because you think you're cynically clever or something. You're actually just a fucking moron."
I don’t I’m  just  lost because I’m talking about employment not parenting 
You’re not answering the question. Why does your employer pay you for not working for them?
"I asked because, when you become a parent (most people) fundamentally change how they see the world.  It's an experience you cannot really accurately convey to anyone who hasn't had kids, but you start seeing things very differently.  You want everything to be better and begin to look at how things will be when you are not around.  This translates not just into thought about if you die of old age, but what if you die in a year, 5 years, 10 years?  You want to work hard, and make the right choices so that your family left behind can make it.  You want the world to be a better, safer, cleaner place - where your kids and their kids can thrive and have as little problems as you can help prevent.


From an employment perspective, you work hard, so you can make more money to buy your kids and family things they want or need, you want a good job with stability and perks that benefit you and your family (retirement plans, medical, dental, vision, child care, fitness plans, etc).  Since stable employment is good for the business, they like happy employees who they don't need to invest in, just to have them jump companies - taking all the knowledge and investment with them.  
"
"Kids can really kick your rear in gear.

I have friends who were working pretty basic jobs, like retail. When they found out a baby was on the way, they both seemed to think longer term. He started looking and got a better job, etc etc. They do this because now they aren't working for themselves but for that greater cause, they're working for their family. Not only do they have a kid on the way but now they need to think about a bigger place to call home, a newer car with better safety ratings, saving money for the kids future education, and other child related expenses.

So, a ""greater cause"" in this context would be the family and the children's future."
Because it’s negotiated into a voluntary bilateral contract
"You are still not answering the question. 

WHY did your employer agree to pay you for not working, if such a thing isn’t in the emplpyer’s interest?"
"Because I agree with you - as long as it’s not a government mandate

If the employer does it voluntarily - then it is in the employers interest for all the reasons previously listed"
You are still not explaining why it is in the employer’s interest to offer paid leave. 
Still waiting to hear why an employer would ever have a benefit to paying an employee for not working!
Employer happiness and well being of course.

PS - what's that under wraps a few seconds in?

Even if Tesla has finally decided to advertise .. This is an amazing first commercial.
"That warehouse sure looks big and empty, any thoughts where that’s at and what it’s for?"

That was awesome
So much yellow
This is more epic than an Avengers trailer.
Is that Roadster videos live footage from the reveal event?  Did anyone notice cameras on it to capture that?
"Holy shi... “T” Tesla logo.

This really puts the employees out front, I really liked that. "
I was so close to finalizing a first production model. After seeing the matte black with red calipers...I feel better about holding off for AWD.
"Song/music used is [""Don't Fall Asleep"" - The Seige ](https://youtu.be/vPBR2C4jUDo)"
"Nice to see the workers who are working so hard to make Tesla a reality.  I realize on the one hands its ""just a job"" but they are really putting the time and effort into it....."
Now imagine if they actually did advertisements. This is just a taste. 
The over abundance of yellow in this video is cracking me up. Nice shot back at that article.
Bad Ass.
"Hnnnnnnngggggg...

....those two robot arms 
....moving the seats to inside
 the cabin so kewl"
This makes my want to work at Tesla.
AWESOME!!
Well now I want me a matte black model 3 more than ever. 
"Don't let /r/cars see this, I'm sure they'll tear it apart some how."
"That was cool.

That was so cool. I'm pumped.

Very awesome video
Nobody ever acused Tesla for lacking in hype that's for sure
"at 0:34, is that a normal car that we've already seen behind that guy? I feel like it looks different."
What's with the ultra wide aspect ratio? Did they film this on 70mm?

"Great video! Exactly the type of marketing I like. Take your time getting all the right pieces together, then come out of the gates running.

Only complaint would be to color correct those reds to Tesla Red, however I am on a phone and could have perceived it incorrectly. Also possible my “reds” are everyone else’s “green.” I guess we’ll never know for sure..."
Holy shi 
Someone do the math on the rotation of the intro scene and see how fast that's going.

"The Proto 1 could either be the Model 3 with dual motors or the Model Y. Interesting that the Model S was doing winter testing, maybe a new battery pack."
How does a company with no advertising afford to build rockets and go to space?
Anyone know the song? I’d listen to that during workouts

New prototype under the tarp? 
Song?
"That song, its hot . Whos the artist?"
How did they get those horses in the shot.  No way they just lucky and there were horse perched on the edge of a plateau ready to be captured in a perfect drone shot right?
Is that the pickup prototype being teased @ 0:16 ?
"The Matte black Model 3 in the video is the same alpha prototype from the unveiling. You can tell because it has the model S door handles, not the normal l curved model 3 handles. Also all initial prototypes have been matte black, semi truck too. So I don’t think we’ll be seeing a matte black color option, it’s just how they paint the prototypes. I also spoke with an engineer who said the model 3 prototypes were super expensive to make. So reusing them only makes sense."
Omg let’s go!!
a higher res version would be nice...
"I'm not a big fan of corporate propaganda but the wholy shit at 1:41 was a nice touch.

Look at that car.  That's 5 months' work right there.  Maybe by September they'll have a second car.  That'd be cool.
Jizz in my pants
terrible song though. i dont know if it's my speakers but it sound like the bass was cracking. not all bassy songs sound like that.
I seriousy doubt that any of the cars get painted by hand.
But... but.... Tesla doesn't advertise.
Just reaching for money 
If only they could produce cars like they produce propaganda. Hmm. 
So basically minorities are up 8000%.
[deleted]
I guess this wouldn't look so good if all the shots were of robots building the cars
Holy sh** *cut to Tesla logo*. Love it. Lol.
Was that Teslanomics guy?
Was the third guy Andy Samberg?
That Roadster cockpit shot...
"At 0:42, you can see the mate black Model 3 has the early handle version.  So it's most likely the original mate black prototype."
"> beautifull wild horses in Nevada during winter.

"it's matte, mate"
"Just from what I’ve heard around the plant, they are indeed building a performance model 3 to accompany the long range and dual motor versions, I hear it’s pretty damn quick.  "
that short clip of the roadster 2 interior... oof
"It's Roadster 2020.. -_-

2.0 is from 2008."
Matt not mate.
Agree.  They deserve some coverage.
"Totally, the people make the company and are the ones who execute on a daily basis. 

One question that I have is the paint shop not automated?  I thought that would be the first thing they would automate."
The whole 6 seconds the gigafactory got! 
"I liked that too. A ton of focus on the people of Tesla in this, which really humanizes the company."
"Agreed.  It really highlights the importance of the people who do the hard work.  Well done Tesla.

Now deliver my 3 please lol."
Elon's come along way from grabbing all of the attention to shifting the focus to everyone who works for him. Pretty cool watching him develop as a leader.
He’s a union busting boss though... one of the leading examples or capitalism exploiting workers...
*insert Tesla T logo* to complete the word 
"From that angle and in broad daylight?  Yes.

The first shot of the steering and console?  No."
What is that on the dashboard? Little LCD screens? I wonder what they display.
"I think I'd hate that wheel though, when doing a tight turn you'd have to pretty much cross your arms surely? Because you can't move your hands around the wheel. "
Man that's horrible. Hopefully not the final design just what they had for the reveal.
"That steering wheel reminds me of the car in I, Robot. "
"At second 16? To short to be the Y, early 3?"
Could it be a pickup prototype?? 
"I agree that it’s likely the first ‘look’ at the Y. 

For those who say it’s too early this is simply not true. If anything you should be concerned if they haven’t started basic design prototyping by now. Prototyping stages take place over years. Even if no mechanicals are inside, it could be a just clay or a shell. 

Not to mention there’s several hints strewn around of things to come.  Video starts out with “Proto 1” written on what looks like a sticky note slapped on the rotor of a piece clearly in testing. Immediately followed by a clip of whatever’s under the cover. Also a few renderings of the Roadster we haven’t seen yet. "
TBD
Tesla tunnel bus prototype without top
"Too tall to be an S or a 3, wrong doors to be an X. OnlY one other option."
Model S refresh?
Def model Y but it looks like it's not fully assembled.
Leaning towards early refresh/redesign work on the S.
"I'm going to place my bet on the Model S refresh, new doors, new panel designs to match some cues of Roadster 2.0, new interior design and will be out in 2020. Eight years after the original Model S, it's about time and I think Elon knows it."
model Y  or the pickup?
Y do you ask?
Looks like a Tesla DeLorean 
     Applies fluff
"Is it advertising if you only pay to produce it, and pay no money to distribute it? I'm not entirely sure. Either way it was pretty awesome."
"I don't know if this counts as advertising, otherwise all the other youtube videos they have filmed would as well. Unless they pay to distribute it, then it is advertising "
Better than all the loveday productions..    Whoever does their promo\-videos gets my personal backing as meeting the  'tesla bar of excellence'
It could be Faraday Future's production line.
Gigafactory.
"It's probably a test site. Why pay for an outdoor research complex when you can safely run your cars in an old warehouse, away from journalists?"
Rumor has it that is the same aspect ratio as the Model 3 HUD.
Good catch! I thought it was 2.39:1 until I saw your comment. Definitely made to play across multiple screens. 
"Yeah, I was surprised when my 21:9 still had black bars on the top and bottom of the video"
Maybe for cinema ads. 
"Thanks for the info, came here just to find out the soundtrack used. Btw any sites which can easily identify sound track from any YouTube url? "
Probably a creative agency of some sort produced it
"clearly photoshopped in afterwards... ;\)

/sarcasm"
Do you have a link to that article? I'd like to see it.
Was pretty much the McGregor video
Hurry before they go out of business!
It seriously should...
They most likely will. 
"That steering wheel might be a deal breaker for me.  It's a car.  Not a space ship.  If they don't give it a proper wheel and dashboard, I might opt for a GTR for my next car."

It’s different... could easily be a Y. I’m extremely surprised more people aren’t talking about it actually.
"Safety. If the power electronics cut out or your battery is discharged you would not be able to stop. 

Also, brakes exert a lot more force than the electric motors can. In case of emergency braking you want as much braking force as possible. 0-100 is exciting, 100-0 is what’s important. "

I think you should ask this on /r/SpaceX. They're the ones building rockets.

No bass cracking here on my Schiit Stack + KZ ZS10 (5 driver IEMs).. it's your speakers.
"Didn’t crack for me, but the bass was super loud. It’s probably cracking for you because the amplifier can’t drive the element, or it’s too loud for the element to reproduce it. "
That’s how it’s suppose to sound - overdriven. 
Later on \(1:11\) they show a quick shot of robot painters.
Who said they are?
"It's not advertisement, it's a marketing promo video."
"What do people think they're proving by saying this? Tesla obviously markets its products and is extremely savvy with social media. They just don't pay to run ads in print or digital media. That's all they have ever meant by ""not advertising."" "
Marketing and advertising are two very different things.  One is paying to show the other.
Hater! It's a video for an all-hands staff meeting.
"This isn't  a paid ad. It's free  to put a vid on utube, and they may actually be paid by utube for this, if it's popular enough.

But you don't even know the difference between marketing and advertising do you? Just some ignorant hateboi."
"They do, just not fast. "
The factory is in the Bay Area and white people are basically the minority here. 
"How are they under paid, you said it yourself they are lower level? If they want to make more they can move to mid level?"

Yea that was really good.
Yep it sure was
NOICE 
They keep toying with me. I want the matte so badly and I’m praying that it’s announced or available before my reservation comes up. 
True but I still believe that the Model 3 performance will have at least the mate black as a performance model exclusive.
What exactly have you heard “around the plant”? 
Matte not matt nor mate. 
It's hard work.
Confused by this as well. It showed both an automated paint shop and someone doing it manually. Not sure what the human was doing. 
*Gigafactory 2 gently weeps*
YES I TOO LOVE THAT TESLA EMPLOYS REAL HUMANS

"Well, not every [super villain can be Hank Scorpio,](https://youtu.be/R3SbnMuiKPU?t=5) not [withstanding the flamethrower.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tnod9vtB4xA)"
Ha I didn't put that together 
That steering and console blew my mind. My God! Best part of the whole video
"From high resolution photos from the reveal, it looks like they display the speedometer, and standard autopilot imagery that we see on the S, the X, and the 3. Very simple. "
Don't think this wheel will stay. They've tried it before and had it removed due to regulation.
"Or the steering is very, very, tight, and they have variable turning ratio depending on speed. Modern cars do this anyway. "
"Agree not tall, but why show 3 under wraps in quarterly video? Doors not 3 sized either. "
I'll go Y with rear falcon doors
"Tesla El Camino confirmed.

Edit: first day line waiters get bottle of Teslaquila (also confirmed)."
The first thing I thought when I saw it was pickup.
"It’s way too short In height for an SUV or crossover. It isn’t the Y.
For hints, compare the distance between the ground and undercarriage. Then compare the wheel size to that space. Then compare the height of the trunk area to the wheel size. Do the same for the height of the roof and compare that total height to the wheels. It is very unlikely to be a crossover or SUV.
Likely S refresh or performance Model 3.

It’s not too early for design, it’s just too early for visual showcasing. Tesla is 90% tied up in the Model 3 production clog, which has proven to be a sad nightmare.  We will see the Model Y reveal in 2019, with preorders for late 2020 for employees.
"
Where to put 2000$?
But why?
"Not def at all. Likely a refresh Model S or performance Model 3. WAY too early for Y, which will probably be revealed in 2019 and be available for employees In late 2020. Also, the symmetry in sizes btw the body, bumper, wheels, and proximity to the ground practically rules out a crossover SUV."
Model S refresh. Not a new model 
"Advertising is usually a paid marketing campaign. 

Advertising is part of marketing but marketing doesn’t necessarily mean advertising "
"Youtube is free distribution. 

When Red Bull sponsors someone to do a 100k feet parachute jump isn't that advertising?"
"Yep. It is advertising. Paying to spread the message is irrelevant.

""To describe or draw attention to (a product, service, or event) in a public medium in order to promote sales or attendance.""

"No worries, unfortunately I don't know of any sites like that but I wish that one existed. I would usually use SoundHound on my phone, I have used Shazam in the past too. If that doesn't work it's often burried somewhere in the public comments. "

"https://www.revealnews.org/article/tesla-says-its-factory-is-safer-but-it-left-injuries-off-the-books/

Specifically:

> There’s one color, though, that some of Tesla’s former safety experts wanted to see more of: yellow – the traditional hue of caution used to mark hazards.

>Concerned about bone-crunching collisions and the lack of clearly marked pedestrian lanes at the Fremont, California, plant, the general assembly line’s then-lead safety professional went to her boss, who she said told her, “Elon does not like the color yellow.”"
"If nothing else, some jurisdictions (Australia for certain) would force them to, because they require continuous handles all the way around."

Cool! I haven't been following the development of their factories since the media stopped covering them incessantly like they used to. 
Merci
The trailer
"I just find it humorous that a lot of people on this board argue Tesla does no advertising and then turn around and share and like and upvote what is most definitely advertising.  Yes, I was snarky.

"
That's golden!  Something tells me that burn is going to go untreated.
"If you think a car factory video that starts with a woman, then cuts to a dark Asian, then another woman, then another black woman and a Mexican, then 2 blacks and 2 Mexicans, and only then finally shows 2 white people in the background of a black woman at the foreground isn't choreographed bullshit, I can't help you and only hope every literal and figurative corner you come across in life has something soft taped over it."

Compared to the same job at other car companies they get paid about 20% less. The next comment is pretty brutal so I deleted mine. I don’t want someone cherry picking quotes from my r/depression comments to try and put me down

"Dunno about that steering column.  One pole?  Looks spartan.

Also, there's no way it will hit production, no airbag."
Putting a few vital pieces of info on that narrow display strip  is genius. You get most of the utility from having two screens while keeping the super-minimalist look. I love that idea.
"Never driven a Tesla with autopilot, but how can you see the imagery on there on such a small screen?"
Looks like an S to me. Not sure why it's covered.
Next gen/refresh S or the performance 3 Model. I hedge toward the former. Unlikely to be the Model Y... too early.
"I think it is model Y, but you can see the back door is opened conventionally.  I know it is an unpopular opinion, but falcon wing doors are much more practical.  They just have to nail the reliability, which may take a couple generations."
"Rear door is opened forward not up. 

It looks like it might be on a Dyno.  Maybe an AWD Dyno. 
"
"looks like falcon doors to me too, so I'd put my money on a Y not fully assembled. "
That's not even far fetched. Imagine it selling like crazy...he could single handedly bring back an icon...

"Doing an AMA on Reddit is “advertising”. 

Promotion of any kind is advertising. "
"[Alternatively](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/advertising?s=t):

noun

1.
the act or practice of calling public attention to one's product, service, need, etc., especially by paid announcements in newspapers and magazines, over radio or television, on billboards, etc.:
to get more customers by advertising.

2.
paid announcements; advertisements."
So... the line between discourse and advertising is intention?
"> Wrong  

He was asking the question..."
Let’s not likenTrump to Tesla. Acting like a buffoon and creating one of the most innovative companies in history isn’t really an apt comparison. 
"I'll defer to your expertise, it's officially an advertisement. Thank you for providing clarification!"
"The first part was a bit unnecessary, the rest of your post was pretty good though. A bit rude though with the first bit."
SHOCKING
That’s fantastic.

"Gigafactory 1 is nowhere near full size yet, so it looks rather smaller than the design renders (not to mention being a different shape). Freemont is a pre-existing factory, so that was fully standing when they took it over - although they did do internal remodelling, and built a test track next door."
"That's cuz most people really mean 'paid advertising' when they say Tesla doesn't advertise. As in Tesla doesn't purchase ad space. While they certainly pay to produce these videos and utilize social media, it's still very impressive they have the marketing presence they do without purchasing much, if any, paid advertisements. "
"Even if you count the budget for this video, their advertising spend is extremely small. Other car companies have to constantly advertise, (including buying Super Bowl commercials) in order to stay competitive..."
Care to share how you know it’s 20% less.  Lot of fake news out there
Yeah but that was a SpaceX feat. 
Honestly a better idea than a matte paint job anyway since matte paint doesn't look good for long without a ton of upkeep.
Matte looks beautiful but it's horrible to own.  It scratches easily and you can't wax it.

The doors don't match anything currently in the Tesla lineup 
Rear refresh maybe?
Next Generation S? 
"I agree they’re more practical, but putting falcon doors on the Y wouldn’t fit with the distinction they’re trying to draw between the premium S/X, and the affordable 3/Y. 

Hopefully I’m wrong and falcon wing doors just become a thing Tesla is known for.  "
The door doesn't look very wide in the back though. I guess that's why I thought it might swing up vs conventional. 
Idk I think the falcon wings are useful in some situations and badass but the biggest issue for me is a roof rack limitation.  I get you can get hitch racks but that’s still a lot of mount space lost because of them. 
They suck for putting stuff on the roof though unfortunately. I’ve got a few giant paddle boards that would like to go on an X or a Y. Not with those doors though. 
Sits too low to the ground to be the Y
"I disagree. While it’s possible it could become a more common door technology *in the future*, it is not an economical door at all, and will not be in the Model Y, which has been proposed to be in the 35-45k starting cost. Hell, the Model 3 didn’t get the fancy auto-present handles, and you think it’s slightly taller and roomier big brother will get falcon doors? You’re dreaming. Sorry I burst your bubble."
Index funds are boring. You heard it here first.
"I suppose so. Aren't most of us ""thought leaders"" in our own way?"
I don't think the two are mutually exclusive. So no.
"He is putting forth a hypothesis and asking people to confirm or deny it in a question

You arent NoVA_traveler, am I right? I have no idea"
So I should just liken him to the President of the united states that ran a fantastic marketing campaign to get elected instead?
"Everything has been an advertisement, think Space X launching rockets/car. Tesla making any video etc...

Marketing is more than making something pretty, it is constructing a motif that people can follow and understand. Advertising is only getting the word out, it literally doesnt matter how its done as long as the end results are there. Even the most basic form of advertising word or mouth is the most difficult as you have to put extreme effort into it. Into consistent quality, into ideas that make people want to talk about it etc... it takes 10 great times for someone to refer you. It takes 1 bad time for someone to smack talk you, like the restaurant I went to which server raw fucking eggs on the pizza twice in a fucking row

Making it clear, I dont give a shit one way or another how Tesla or if Tesla is advertising or not. It doesnt worry me, if anything I applaud them in getting such a high RIO in marketing"
[removed]
Thanks for the info!
"I have nothing against Tesla's marketing strategy.  They are very social media savvy, they get great bang for the buck - look at the brand awareness and following they've built up.  It's fantastic.  

Once again, the issue is fanboi hypocrisy or ignorance, depending on how you want to look at it.  And that's not unique to this sub, you'll see the same behavior in other subs that cater to avid fans."
Yea. I’m at work but I’ll get a source at lunch. I applied there a few months ago so that’s how I learned about it.
Oh shit! Turns out I was wrong. I looked it up on indeed and it says 61% above average. I applied for a warehouse associate job and I was offered $12.50 an hour 2 months ago. I looked it up then and it said 20% below average at the time. It also said on indeed that the average pay for a warehouse associate in the east bay location paid and average of 12.50. I guess things have changed. Guess I should look into shit before I post a slaty comment.

I’m hoping my next car will be electric. Currently drive a Toyota Corolla for commuting and would need something similar in an EV. I can’t justify $35-40k for an EUV when my 4 year old corolla only cost me $14k and will last me 300k miles with almost no maintenance other than oil changes. Hopefully when I’m ready for my next car in 8 years there are enough used EVs that it makes sense.

In 10 years more than half of the automobiles will be electric. It’s just a matter of time until they become affordable to everyone. Just give this industry some time and it will flourish :D
"If they could afford it, I'd say \+90&#37; of people would want to drive a Model X or S. The remaining 10&#37; are the old generation dudes like Jay Leno whose emotional identity is attached to those old cars. "
Ya I highly doubt that.
With gas nearly $3 a gallon again I think Tesla is going to have a nice next few years.
How is the Volt?
I can't wait to save enough for a model s 
I am lazy and I can't be bothered to go to the gas station...electric cars should be marketed this way
I was fed up with going to the gas station every week.  Now I get that time back into my life and save money and maintenance.
"Eh, they *want* their next vehicle to be electric. Right now the Model S and X are far too expensive, the Model 3 is basically not available to buy, and other electric cars are kind of shit and not well priced compared to comparable gas cars. So realistically these 50 million Americans will not actually be getting electric cars any time soon.

When the Model 3 is truly in mass production, and it's truly $35k instead of $55k, then this might start happening."
"this seems way too high - I expect a lot of sampling bias in who 
 actually answered the question...a lot of EV enthusiasts who a) can be bothered to answer a question about EVs, b) AAA members

about half of americans don't know electric vehicles that are realistic competitors to normal cars exist, and think there are a tiny amount of smart cars on the road.  additionally EVs don't exist in the vehicle categories for 75% of the current market.  I know this is ""next car"" but it's not much of a plan to have your next car be a pickup that nobody has even seen a design for, much less a price and specs.  

"
50 million Americans say they are gonna be firefighters when they grow up too. 
"There's only 126 million households in the US.  
  
You really think that 40% of all American households will have an electric car in 10 years?"
"The two biggest things that need to addressed to bring EVs into mass adoption are 1) prices, which are already coming down. Remember the first Leaf started at $33k and went 84 miles. Now the Model 3 will start at $35k, has a much nicer appearance and (probably) interior, and goes 220 miles. *In just 7 years.* And the price drop on batteries is happening even quicker now, especially for companies like Tesla who are able to make everything in-house

2) Charging time. Now that range is surpassing 200 miles on a $35k car, people aren’t as worried about running out of juice. Now, they want to recharge the car in 1/2 hour, which is not an unreasonable feat in the eyes of EV owners (at least with Superchargers, faster CCS and Chademo is coming though). The common misconception with ICE drivers is that every time you charge you *have* to charge to 100%. I don’t need to explain here why batteries slow their charge rate somewhere between 75-85%. However it’s so engrained in people’s minds: ‘I gotta fill up the car’, and that transitions to ‘I gotta get to 100% SOC’. Most of the time however, even with cars like the Leaf, you can fast charge to 80% and get to your destination without a problem. People want it to go from 0-100% in 30 mins, and that’s not really possible right now. But charging to 80% and stoping at another charger is usually a more cost effective and time saving measure. "
"Will be, or would like to be?"
I’m saving up. 
"I don't think so, you Yanks like your big, pickups too much."
"Yeah my next car will be an Audi S5.  But will it actually, probably not if my wife has anything to do with it.  "
Hahahaha.... simmer down now tesla.... you still don’t have your factory running right yet. 
"my next car will 100% be electric, I’m so done with ICE cars, such an inferior, inefficient technology. "
What is the percent of them postponing buying a new car until then? 
"I am surprised this already is that far now, I would have expected for the big moment of change to be this thanksgiving when tens of thousands of families get their test drives and its like back with the iphone, check this out, pinch-zoom, except for autopilot, autopark, acceleration, voice commands like 'navigate to a drug store near lafayette', phone app preheat/precool and locate, never scratch ice again etcpp. Thats when I think the next reservation surge will come. "
"There are options now.  Soon, Sondors will realease this, and for 10 grand, you'll have a sporty, cool little car.  "
Several hours to fully charge the battery.  No thanks.
"OK, so 50 million is 20% of 250 million. That's seems like a lot of potential car buyers. I know a lot of people need cars to get around in the US, but that's basically the entire adult population."
"> ""A new AAA survey finds 20% of Americans say their next vehicle will be an electric car. That's up from 15% in 2017, the first time that AAA asked the question.""

That's a **lot** of demand for EVs, and a year-over-year increase in demand of ~30%.

Just to give a perspective, demand for 50 million new EVs, if we consider that the [average new car price is now over $36,000](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/average-new-car-prices-set-record-high-up-nearly-2-percent-in-december-2017-according-to-kelley-blue-book-300576732.html), which translates to:

    $36,000 * 50,000,000 = $1,800,000,000,000 = 1.8 trillion dollars

To say that 1.8 trillion dollars of EV revenue is going to be 'transformatory' is the understatement of the century.

Another important result of the AAA survey is the reduction in range anxiety:

> ""One big reason that Americans are becoming more likely to consider buying an electric car: concerns about running out of electricity are diminishing.
> 
> Some 58% said it was a concern that would prevent them from buying an electric car, marking a decline from 68% in 2017.
>
> ""Range anxiety is less of a concern than it has been in the past,""""

With so much pent-up demand for EVs it's a very interesting question how quickly the U.S. and European markets will be able to transition to EVs.

There's one piece of hard data available about this, here's how the EV market of a rich, advanced economy evolved over the last 10 years: [this pretty amazing graph shows how Norway evolved away from gasoline/diesel cars to EVs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_electric_vehicles_in_Norway#/media/File:Evolution_Norgewian_passenger_car_market_share_by_fuel.png).

**The share of gas/diesel only cars went from 95.7% of the market to only 37.8%**, while this year plug-in EVs are going be more than 50% of all new cars sold - and EVs will probably never drop below that percentage ever again.

Why did this happen in Norway first, and why not in say Germany:

- Norway has a higher GDP than Germany (but still a lower one than the U.S. if average levels of taxation are included),
- EVs have a number of unique advantages over ICE cars in colder climates.
- Significant tax incentives for EVs that reduced the effective average sales price of EVs to be more affordable to more consumers

If we consider the Model 3 which reduces the sales price of a Tesla EV from ~$100,000 to $30,000-$40,000 (with tax incentives included), then it opens up the same kind of market dynamics that Norway saw with the Model S/X and other EVs, in other, bigger countries as well.

Most car buyers in Germany or the U.S. cannot afford a Model S/X today, but a significant portion of them will be able to afford a Model 3. The market introduction of the Model 3 is pretty well timed in this regard.

As to how long it will take for EVs to dominate the U.S. and European markets: if Norway is a good measure of how an economy can adapt EVs ""organically"", with little disruption, then 5-10 years is more than enough for EVs to go beyond 50%.

In fact an argument can be made that the transition to EVs will be even faster than the 5-10 years baseline: traditional car makers could afford to ignore and lose Norway as a market - it's a small country - but they cannot afford to lose the U.S. or German markets - and [Germany is already showing explosive growth of EV sales as well](https://cleantechnica.com/2017/11/04/nearly-40000-plug-electric-vehicles-sold-germany-far-2017/).

So I think the *conservative* estimate would be for the ""EV transition"" to happen in 5-10 years in the U.S. and in Europe - but faster than 5 years is entirely possible as well, if car makers are able to keep up with demand.

*_edit: added the tax incentive effect_*"
Passing 15% market share would get EVs to the next level of the innovation adoption life cycle. Out of Early Adopter and into Early Majority. We're currently still stuck in the Innovator stage in the US :(
5% Percent or  5 percentage points improvement?
Thank you this is more accurate. while I do think it's probably a significant number it's not great to extrapolate like this it's very inaccurate way of looking at things. The NRA for example does the same stuff with guns and self defense and make up some crazy large number by extrapolating out to the entire population from some small statistical sample set.
Was last year's result 19% or 15%?
"Or a 30% improvement in just one year, if you are a marketer."
"These surveys are always inaccurate due to their polling methods, and they're generally interesting to find out why:  Usually they call land-lines and talk to octogenarians who actually have / answer a wired phone, and their numbers come 100% from people that talk to spam callers long enough to fill out a survey.  

So, that's neat data by itself.  Old people plan to buy an EV next.  This is something you'd expect to see younger people doing, but younger people aren't answering spam calls and surveys in huge numbers.

Good news I guess?  "
"The question is - what will happen to all the ICE used car prices. 

Especially on the luxury segment - where the prices would plummet if customers switch to electric even from the same brand. It's an interesting tax consumers will pay..."
"I agree. Is the Model Y supposed to cost less than the Model 3? I haven't been keeping up lately. I read a year ago it could end up costing $20,000 but I'm not sure if that is just speculation."
"This needs to be at the top.

I'm not spending half of what I paid for my house on an electric car when there's no charging stations at most places in my state."
"which should happen in the next 2 years if battery prices stay on the current trend line.

the initial purchase price for a 40kw EV and an ICE power train should be equal in 2020."
"I got my Honda Civic for $4k and it still has 200,000 Miles to go before it should die. I’m more concerned about the slow pace when it comes to repairs. That doesn’t seem to be a huge issue until it happens. Hopefully Tesla fixes that in the next couple of years."
"Truth. My Model 3 is ~310 miles. We are way past 200.

The new Roadster is going to have *at least* 620 miles of range.

edit: I wrote this comment assuming we were in a different sub. I assumed /r/technology for some reason. You guys already know this."
"The first Roadster was EPA rated at 244 miles, so they broke that barrier in 2007 with their first car.

https://www.tesla.com/blog/where-rubber-meets-road"
Talk about panel gaps ...
"100% agreed. When I got my first car in 2010, I promised myself it would be the last car I bought which used gas. 8 years later, I'm still holding onto it. I'd like something shiny and new, of course, but at the end of the day I have to wait for Tesla to offer something I can afford (Model 3, when they finally get to my reservation). And while I'm waiting, having my current car paid off lets me save up so what I can spend and what Tesla's able to charge can line up that much faster.

Also, while waiting sucks, it gets easier when I remind myself that every year I have to wait just means my next car will be that much better. Tech gets faster. Build quality improves. Prices drop. People continue to innovate. The value just keeps getting better.

Not everyone will have the same mindset as me, of course, but I think a lot of people are going to be willing to wait if they see something worthwhile. A car which can save you time and money on maintenance and fuel, while having great safety, performance and reliability (and eventually the ability to drive you, should you be sleepy, intoxicated or injured) is probably going to be worthwhile for a lot of people."
"They didn’t say *new car* or *tesla*.

Plenty of used options from many makers in the next 5 years."
"At one point the $35k Model 3 will unlock a lot of new market, but even until then there is the used Tesla market. Lot's of Tesla owners say they would buy a Tesla again and their used cars have a high resale value. Basically buying used S or X for half price indirectly drives sales for the new ones."
"I take this article with a grain of salt.

Most people don't replace vehicles every 3 years and me saying my next car will be an electric doesn't guarantee it to be an electric.

This article is on par with ""250 million Americans say they will lose weight and get into shape.... but will start doing so on Monday.... now it's next month to get a fresh start....New Years resolution baby!!!"""
"The demand that actually matters for now is almost new car buyers.  Only 6 million new cars are sold in the US per year. Most Americans do not buy brand new cars and the median age of a car on the road is almost [12 years now](http://www.autonews.com/article/20161122/RETAIL05/161129973/average-age-of-vehicles-on-road-hits-11.6-years). There'll certainly be demand but until there are reliable used EVs on the used car market most of those 50 million people will still be driving beat up old gas cars.

It matters a lot more what people who are planning on buying a new car within the next year or so think.  I think there's plenty of demand but sensationalist titles like this are just silly. "
"If you don't have good intuitions about the general path of how things change in the future, there's really no hope for you as a stock picker."
"I actually teach at a middle school (in a city where nobody drives $100k cars) and students think Tesla is cool, but the only reason I’ve heard why is because it can drive itself.  I commute in an egolf and they think it’s weird but interesting that it doesn’t need gas.  Gas stations aren’t for old people, they’re the norm."
"I mean, heads pop out the window when I drive my MX-5 past a school, not really a good metric for anything..."
Pull up anywhere in a model 3 and people are going to turn heads. It's new and people still see it as rare and cool. A Tesla model s or x in a smaller town may turn a few heads but in any decent sized city they've just become a part of normal life and nobody really pays attention to them. I expect that will soon happen with the model 3 once I more people recieved them and there are more on the roads.
"I got that when I had my convertible BMW too, kids love cool looking things."
5-20? I’m 35 and instinctively yell “3!”  every time I see one
Gas stations are amazingly time limited compared to a supercharger. 
"Yeahhhhhhh a Tesla doesn't look any different on the road than any other car, this is fan fiction. You can't tell that it doesn't take gas or run on electricity or runs on poop by it.. looking like a normal car."
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/OAgzggh
Well motor torque doesn't matter. That's why gears exist
A used Chevy Volt is a great value.  The federal rebates for new result  a bigger than normal price gap between new Volts and 1 or 2 year old models.
"I grew up driving standard transmission cars too; but I don't miss them with my Model S because it's a complete non-issue. ""Shifting"" is not a thing anymore.
I get the same directly-connected feel; and ""engine braking"" actually does something useful. I think it's *better* than a standard transmission car because it's *always* in the right gear no matter what you're doing. And I don't have to wear out my left leg in stop-and-go traffic."
Tesla isn't the only one who makes electric vehicles.
[deleted]
"I'd say in 12 years half of new car sales is possible, especially if there's a decline in sales because robotaxis drive so many miles per year."
"I think that's a bit optimistic.  A good analogy would be hybrid cars.  About [200,000 EVs](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/01/2017-was-the-best-year-ever-for-electric-vehicle-sales-in-the-us/) sold last year in the US.  About 200,000 [hybrids sold in 2005.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicles_in_the_United_States#Historical_sales_1999-2014)

It's been over 10 years since 2005, and half the cars aren't hybrids."
"Don't be too sure about that.  I have an aversion to large cars, so I'm looking at the Model 3."
"Keep in mind that for worldwide EV sales, 3$/gallon for gas is laughably cheap. As great to see gas prices starting to be semi realistic (if still stupidly low) in the states. Combined with the fact that many of those other countries have better EV rebates and incentives than the states and it paints a pretty picture for upcoming EV adoption. 

We've been hovering at the equivalent of 4-5$/gallon for gas in Ontario for years, Europe is 6-7$/gallon, etc."
"Exactly. Americans want a $24,000 electric car. This is a long long way off."
<1% IMHO
"True but you also have to note that these are people being asked a hypothetical about their ""next"" car.

If the question was something like ""Will you buy an electric car in the next 5 years?"" you would probably get much smaller numbers since a car often lasts 5 to 10 years minimum.

By the time most of these people that were asked are buying their next I am sure electric cars will be far more common and cheaper too."
Basically the entire adult population of the US drives a car.
Demand in the US has increased by 12.5 million EVs!
"Unfortunately, Norway is not a good model for the US car market.  And you missed what is maybe the biggest factor, which is that [Norway offered *massive* incentives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_electric_vehicles_in_Norway#Existing_incentives), far beyond those in consideration in even the most pro-EV US states.  Not only at the time of purchase, but they gave continuing fee and tax waivers over the life of the car as well.  "
"What do you consider to be the unique benefits of an EV in cold climates? Cold weather absolutely killed my range when I had a LEAF, and winter doesn't particularly do any favors for my i3."
"“if car makers are able to keep up with demand.” ... LOL.

A couple problems with that line of wishful thinking:

- industry can’t/wont’t produce anywhere near that percentage of EVs. Most manufacturers are only now coming out with their first models

- in the US, the federal incentive is not only much smaller, but phases out pretty quickly.  "
"I think introducing a speed limit in Germany would also help a lot.

People like to go 180 km/h and this has a huge impact on the range of EVs."
[deleted]
"Used electric cars will fill this gap up until a much cheaper electric car comes out. In a few years there will be a lot of second Model 3s on the market for under 30,000."
"Model Y will probably be a $5k premium on he 3 sedan, kinda like X to S price difference."
"I've personally given up on Tesla making a truly affordable car - the Model 3 is great value if you compare it to luxury sedans, but if your baseline is a midrange Honda, Tesla is still a long ways off.

I know the batteries alone cost a ton, and that's fine (when I compare I accept that the electric version will cost more up front but save on fuel), but Tesla is also still focused on things I'd argue are over-engineered for the mass market. I don't need door handles that pop out or a screen better than my laptop, or even the all-glass roof. My next car will (hopefully) be electric, but I'm not ever going to be buying in the luxury market segment. Unless Tesla puts out a not-very-exciting car it'll always be out of my price range. "
most people charge at home.
"I'm pretty sure that will scale with the number of electric vehicles on the road. Right now electric vehicles are more of a luxury niche, as they become more popular more mechanics will learn how to service and repair them. Because it will take more cars on the road to make that transition, it will probably be a lagging issue, where until we reach saturation, it will be slower."
"I'm waiting on:

* My 2008 ICE vehicle to die
* Owning a house to install the electric charger
* Being able to afford a Tesla (technically I can, but house comes first)"
If/when tesla delivers on all the model 3 reservations there will be a ton of them out there. I can easily see there being a healthy used market of 3s at a good price where a lot of people make the switch.
It might not be accurate but I think it shows sentiment growing in the direction of EVs
"When will be the first year a million electric cars be sold in the US? 2021 is a possible I think.  600,000 teslas and 400,000 from other makers."
Agreed. It will be interesting to see though how that changes when people get access to Teslas for 35k (as opposed to 100k).

"Tell me about it.  I'm planning on trading in my 2014 Volt when the Model 3 is available (estimated delivery May 2019).  By then, I'll have 84,000 miles on it, and based on KBB for 2013 Volts, worth less than $8000 on trade-in.  

I know it doesn't make a lot of economic sense for me to trade it in, but 2+ hours of commuting in stop and go traffic and my HOV access ending next year has pushed me into wanting to get a new EV with EAP or something equivalent.  Also, I'm sick of gassing up 4 or 5 times a year..."
Complex software is scary
"It's always in the right gear because there is only one gear, but that doesn't mean it couldn't use more. Teslas destroy in 0-60 time but are very beatable in quarter mile races because of this. Formula E cars are running up to 5 speed gearboxes."
Are there any that are cheap enough for 50 million folks to just go and buy one?
It's my first month as an EV owner I'm not going back. I'll keep my single ice vehicle begrudgingly for long road trips (we are military) and because it's paid off but that's it. Hopefully prices come down soon used leafs can be had for under 10k but we need cars people want to be seen in for it to really take over mainstream along with an increase in income for the younger generation that will accept these cars.
"It will be faster in my opinion. 

The first factor is the practicality. Electric will be more reliable, cheaper to maintain and eventually also time saver (charging at work/home saves on the trips to gas stations).

The second factor is ""coolness"". ICE cars will be seen as dinosaurs and once this mindset sets in people minds, the game is over. It will be repeat of the smartphone transition.

The bonus factor is the Eco effect. In the US, Tesla is fast becoming the leading car manufacturer without any significant regulations. In EU, once the car manufacturers bite the bullet and make the transition, the regulators will make sure the clean EVs become the norm. In China they are already on the right path."
"In 12 years it'll be difficult to buy an ICE at all, it will probably be niche vehicles like big trucks and sportscars.  12 years is how long it took to convert from 99% horses to 99% cars (the majority of them EVs!) a century ago.  And that was switching away from animals you feed and reproduce in your own yard, and without the crunch of countries banning horses like France and China and India nad so on have talked about doing by 2030."

"Sadly true. No one likes an ugly hybrid. Big car manufacturers have to make EVs look sexy, have long range, quick charge, affordable price and have a kick in them. 

When you have all 5 aspects (or most) of a “perfect” car then everyone buys in. Also take into account the domino effect. "
Still electric is what I meant. 
"Well 5% more, 20% total, and 50million don't matter. The only thing that matters is that the number is getting bigger year over year. I think we can all agree on that."
"I would also add that “electric” in many people’s minds includes PHEVs. For example, Volo’s goal of having their whole fleet be “electric” by 2020 really means they will be mostly hybrids and some true EVs; but the lay people I’ve spoken to don’t realize that. "
"Hell, I saw a used smart electric with 7k miles listed at 5500!"
"This is why I reserved a model 3 even though I was 2 weeks late to hope for early delivery. I didn't want to be mr. ""I'm so totally getting a Tesla some day!"""
That's why I would say my next car will be electric. By the time I'm ready for a new car (5-10 years from now) electric cars are gonna much more mainstream and affordable. It'll almost unreasonable to buy non-electric.
Sure. I definately would like an electric car as my next car (preferably Tesla at the moment) but i sure don´t have the money right now or in the next year. Hope is there that you can buy cheap used (and good) electric cars in like 5-10 years or whenever i actually need a car.
"Not necessarily the life of the car. EV incentives are to be phased out over time, with free toll roads being the first to disappear. They will still be set a maximum of 50% of what it costs to drive a petrol car, and plans are in the works to differentiate between diesel and petrol cars as well. 

The Norwegian incentives are no sales tax (VAT) and no vehicle one-time fee. Regular ICE has usually seen a combined tax of about 100%, but recent shifts in taxation has skewed this somewhat. Hybrids have also benefited from tax discounts, but they keep moving the bar when they adjust the tax/fee rates, so that mild hybrids benefit less. A good hybrid (on NEDC-paper, for what it’s worth) would fetch close to or around 50% tax rebate. 

I believe that once EV’s start competing in price with regular ICE’s at the same time as range increases and charging infrastructure expands the shift to EV’s will happen with or without incentives. They are cheaper to run and there’s less things to go wrong. We certainly haven’t figured out all the hurdles yet, but the marketplace is wide open for newcomers to do cool things in terms of charging infrastructure and more. Large cities are also likely to ban diesels in the near future, and petrol cars down the line. Forget 2040, the shift is coming sooner. My 13 year old Audi A6 will break even with a Model 3 over 10 years of ownership. Basically, when it’s time to replace I can buy any sub $60k EV and total cost of ownership should be lower than a used $20k ICE. "
"IIRC the incentives were enough that a Model S was Ford Focus money or not far off.

To put things in perspective, this is what you got if you bought an all electric:

* Don't have to pay the 25% VAT
* No road tax (~$340 a year)
* No parking fees for public lots
* No toll payments
* Can use bus lanes"
"> And you missed what is maybe the biggest factor, which is that Norway offered massive incentives

True - and I edited my comments to add the tax incentives factor.

But note that there's a number of mitigating factors:

- in Norway the average new car sales price is $50,000, while in the U.S. and in Germany it's $36,000,
- the effect of the say $7,500 federal tax credit is about 20% of the average new car sales price in the U.S. - which is pretty close to the 25% VAT benefit in Norway

I believe the main thing missing in the U.S. and in Germany was an EV car in the ~$36,000 price sweet spot with no range anxiety attached - and the Model 3 fills in that role.

Tax incentives will help too, but in the end I think the evolution of the market will primarily be average sales price and capability/design driven.

Plus there's the disruptive factor of EVs on traditional car manufacturing: I simply cannot see EVs spreading in the U.S. and in Germany without them disrupting traditional automotive industry much faster than they can possibly adapt.

This would necessarily result in either price increases for ICE cars, or in bankruptcies and a reduction in ICE car supply - which again increases their price. It's a deadly feedback spiral once it starts, which could accelerate the ""EV transformation"" massively.

This process will be further accelerated by the steady decline of new gas stations and the conversion of existing gas stations into more profitable shopping/entertainment centers, with charging stations to attract EV users.
"
"The car starts reliably no matter how cold it is, the heat comes on instantly, and if you’re plugged in you can preheat without expending any “fuel.”

Range does take a substantial hit, but that’s much less of a concern with a long-range EV than it would be with a LEAF or i3."
"When the battery is sufficiently sized and heated, electric propulsion eliminates the worry about being able to start the engine in cold weather."
"the incentive isn't going to be needed anymore the drop in battery cost will be enough by 2020 that EVs will be cheaper than ice vehicles on initial purchase.

they're already ahead on monthly cost of ownership.

the new mercedes EQ line is made all on the same production line, so it's just a matter of picking a propulsion type every other car can be a different option.

theyre going into production next year."
"> industry can’t/wont’t produce anywhere near that percentage of EVs. Most manufacturers are only now coming out with their first models

That's my point: the ICE automotive industry is, to a large extent, unprepared - which will accelerate (!) the transition to EVs.

The reason is that the collapse of the ICE automotive industry will have a negative effect on ICE car supply, driving consumers over to EV offerings (like to those from Tesla), which will further accelerate the transition.

The only open questions are the ""when"" and the ""how fast""."
"Or eliminating speed limits here in North America to encourage more rapid battery capacity innovation. Man, I'm a genius!!"
"Oh alright, it must have been a rumor then. So from what you are saying, it looks like the cheapest Tesla is going to be the Model 3 for a long while then ... unless the pickup truck is cheaper (which it likely won't be)."

"Well yeah, it's gonna take more vehicles on the road for more repair shops to be familiar with them. The amount of time consumers have to put into maintaining their car is a factor when purchasing one.

"This. This is when EVs will really take over.

Buying a used volt really lowered the barrier to entry since they started production in 2011."
"The only other part I worry about, is being able to own and charge without living in a single family detached home. Lots of people in apartments and condos that don't have garages, and use street parking or assigned parking spots.

If you can't charge it while you sleep, and there's not chargers at your work, and if you run a tight schedule, it simply won't be practical to have an EV."
"Yes but this is a complete hogwash of an article.  I would seriously bet money that the vast majority of those 50 million people cannot even afford an EV at the current cheapest model price.

I'd love to get an EV and would probably say as well that my next vehicle will more than likely be an EV but I, fingers crossed, won't even plan on buying a new car for 10+ years.

I'm also going to add that I massively doubt 50 million Americans said this as well combining what I said above about those who could reasonably afford one as their next vehicle.  

Hell, we only had 57 million people actually vote in our 2016 election and if you're telling me some random online questionnaire generated almost as much as that.... it's why I take this with a grain of salt."

TIL the mid 10’s is “very beatable.” I suppose with an additional gear it might break into the 9’s or 8’s....
"Yes, especially used.  I got my Volt 2 years ago for less than 20k."
The large elephant in the room here is oil prices.  The higher the my go the more hybrids sell and the more demand for ev. The fact oil is 70 bucks right now means car companies will see a tick up in hybrid sales again.  People are short sighted so as long as gas is stupid cheap like it was for the past several years it is cool to own that hellcat vs some eco car even if it is a Tesla.  So if oil prices stay high then Elon needs a new capital raise or just out right buy a small car company to go way beyond 10k a week try 35k a week.  The demand will show up like magic once gas is high.  
"> 12 years is how long it took to convert from 99% horses to 99% cars (the majority of them EVs!) a century ago.

Bulllllshiitttttt."
That's far too much too accomplish in 12 years given the sheer volume of capital and people and complexity. We won't be pulling near enough cobalt out of the ground for instance. We'll get there though.
I will add that Lexus' hybrids in addition to better fuel efficiency also provide better performance (for most models). They are probably the only hybrid cars with intention to look cool and give advantage when compared to the regular models.  
"Exactly this.

It’s not the electric or hybrid bit it’s the ugly ass car that I wouldn’t buy if it came with a v8, 0-100 in 3 seconds and got 2000ks to a tank.

They ugly.

We looked at hybrids but they were either: ugly, poor range, fuel saving on 5 years didn’t recoup the cost, slower than combustion option or all of the above.

Tesla gets the press because they appeal to a *car* buyer not a tree. Not ugly, fast, ok range, decent charge time. 

But it’s really the first two. I’d buy a Prius tomorrow if it would do 0-100 in 3 seconds. I’ll put up with the rest."
"oh of course and it's great...especially if we can push growth of renewable energy sources at the same time. Would do wonders to lower all the pollution stacking up around the world due to cars, oil, and coal.

Especially if China and India can benefit from these things (won't happen in the near future sadly)"
We can agree that some people claim that this is what is being said. That is all.
"many will not end up buying a car.  self\-driving EVs are right around the corner.  EVs last over 500,000 and will soon last a million.  so much cheaper to fuel them.  prepare to have your mind blown and not worry about climate change, expensive transportation costs, car accidents, wars for oil.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32WheBYnXEI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32WheBYnXEI)"
"True.  But it's still a step in the right direction.  As long as the PHEVs have >20 miles of electric range, they will get folks hooked on electric propulsion without hampering their lifestyle in the short term.  It will be a while before everyone can afford battery-electric cross-country-capable SUVs."
"I imagine the Smart electric probably has better durability than something like a Nissan Leaf because it has a Tesla battery.  

I guess a positive side effect of being one of the first to market with a desirable EV is that in the used car market, your cars will be the most desirable EV’s.  A used Leaf that only has 50-60 miles range after a few years is not going to bring very much money.  While a Model 3 that retains 90% battery capacity after 200k miles doesn’t sound like a big gamble.
"
"5-10 years from now, hopefully it will be almost impossible to buy non-electric.  Even now, replacing a gas car immediately makes environmental sense (harm of continuous fuel burning overwhelms the sunk cost of manufacturing), and often makes economic sense as well.  If you are thinking about going electric in 10 the next years, keep your eyes peeled because the right time might be sooner than that!"
"Also, I remember reading that they didn't have to pay an import fee (though I've never been clear whether this was separate from the VAT waiver or just a restatement that got garbled in translation).  But either way the point is that Norway went really big on incentives to the point that they weren't just offsetting the higher initial price of EVs."
"> IIRC the incentives were enough that a Model S was Ford Focus money or not far off.

A Model S in Norway still costs about as much as in the U.S.: $80k-$90k base price, plus options. Norway doesn't *pay* people to buy Teslas - what they have done is mainly to apply punitive taxes against gas guzzlers.

If you want a Model S in Norway you still have to come up with that $80-$90k plus options.

Which is why I think that when the base price of the Model 3 drops to $35k plus options, the Model 3 will compete very well against average price ICE offerings in the U.S. and in Germany as well, *without any tax incentives*.
"
"> When the battery is sufficiently sized and heated, electric propulsion eliminates the worry about being able to start the engine in cold weather.

That's really only a concern for ICE vehicles with undersized batteries, which fits with your point that the EVs also need sufficiently sized batteries for the cold. Almost everyone I know up here uses truck starter batteries in their cars and we have no problems starting our cars after sitting at the airport in the -40s for a week."
"You are completely wrong about that. The ICE industry isn't jumping onto EVs, yet, because it can't make money with mass market vehicles until 2020. But in 2019 and 2020 there are more than 100 different EVs and hybrids entering the market worldwide. The thought that the ICE industry somehow is unprepared is laughable and just based on the narrative made up by tech people who don't know anything about the industry. It's like when they kept going on about how Tesla supposedly had gamechanging factories that are better than anything those oldfashioned and complacent ICE people could ever dream up. Turns out that was all nonsense, as dozens of manufacturing specialists said all along. All major car manufacturers are amongst the most innovative companies in the world and they actually know their stuff. Those companies are old precisely because they survive by being so innovative and resilient in one of the most competitive economic fields in the world.

Basically the change to EVs will likely just consolidate the market power of the industry giants. They are able to finance their EV adventures with the profits of their ICE sales and buy the most promising startups. For at least another dozen years we will see drastic advances in EV technology and smaller companies will have greater and greater problems keeping up with the pace of innovation. If they get into trouble, the big companies will generally get bailed out by governments. You will see the Chinese enter the western markets more in the next few years and there will be a ton of new names popping up everywhere, but those will generally either be offshoots of existing companies or startups that will get absorbed into the major companies after a few years."
"Of course. The cheaper a car is, the more cars they will sell. Since they are having mass production problems with the model 3, they need to stay away from affordability until they make enough cars that they can handle the demand for the model 3"
"The cheapest will be the Model 3, yes, but if the cost of the batteries comes down and Tesla catches up with demand, the cost of the 3 itself -- or at least the larger battery model -- may also come down. They've dropped prices before, and made options standard. So it won't necessarily require a next vehicle for the Model 3 to become more generally affordable."
"Yeah, we still need an order of magnitude drop ok price of the battery to get them to mid 20,000’s"
"[](/derpysad-r)[](/sp)

> 250 miles of range

Sadly, that's kind of a fantasy number of Hyundai's part. The starting model (~40KWh) gets [186 miles of WLTP range](https://insideevs.com/hyundai-kona-ev-gets-official-range-rating-292-miles/).

For comparison's sake, [the 2018 Nissan Leaf](https://insideevs.com/2018-nissan-leaf-got-range-ratings-in-wltp-cycle/) gets:

* 235 Miles NEDC range
* 177 - 258 Miles WLTP range
* **151 Miles** EPA range

The base Model 3 ($35,000) will get 220 miles of EPA range, and the base long range model ($44,000) will get 310 miles of EPA range.

So for comparison, once you account for the difference in how WLTP and EPA measure their cars, the lowest-end Model 3 will get about 70 more miles on a charge than the Kona.

Sub-200 miles on a car is bad, and sub-100 miles is abysmal. It's not enough for this country, in that you'll never make any major inroads past the ""hippie quotient"" of the car-buying market until you start making EVs with comparable range.

It will be far more important than comparable pricing, given how much of an impact the used market will make on that factor."
You can get them without a battery lease if you pay a bit more up front.

Am I going to trust that a car will pick me up in the wilderness after camping?  What if cell service sucks like it does in most national parks?  

Also, self-driving cars will not be as remotely cheap per mile as all these super optimistic suggestions. They'll be maybe slightly cheaper than Uber is now, but the companies that own them will actually want to make money (unlike most Uber drivers). "
"And yes, it seems like 20 miles is the magic minimum number - [apparently](https://www.statisticbrain.com/commute-statistics/) 51% of Americans commute 20 miles or less round-trip. 

After that, 50 miles EV range is enough for 85% of commute distances. The Chevy Volt is there and the Honda Clarity is nearly so. They're just a bit too expensive still and there's no range buffer.

Looks like most other PHEVs are targeting 30 miles for now, which at least hits that 20 mile minimum and then some. 

I'll suggest that game over (hybrids, PHEVs & BEVs exceeding 50% of new sales) will be hit once you can get 60 miles for $20K list price."
"Agreed. I live in Australia and our government is somewhat slow when it comes to adopting green energy and combating climate change. I think there is a tax initiative for electric/hybrid cars though but I just heard our finance minister on a radio talk show this afternoon talking about removing incentives for people buying into green energy (solar, wind, electric cars). His reasoning was that he believes the price of these things are l going to be cheaper than fossil fuels in the near future. 

I do agree with that but I think now is still too early for the government to start removing these incentives.

Unfortunately I'm not really in the right place financially to purchase a new car at the moment (I'm 19 and studying + working full time l) but hopefully when I do need to get a new car, it will be electric ;)"

That's only because they were in essence an U.S. car maker subject to import taxes, while most of the competing ICE cars are manufactured in Europe, which are exempt from the import tax.

That particular tax break only moved Tesla to be *on par* with ICE car-makers.

The bigger tax incentives were the VAT and new car registration tax breaks.

"> All major car manufacturers are amongst the most innovative companies in the world and they actually know their stuff.

To be amongst the ""most innovative companies in the world"" is a crowded place: Blackberry Inc, PC manufacturers, Nokia and the Zune says hi!

Seriously, I believe the rosy picture you paint about the ICE automotive industry is, largely, an illusion driven by wishful thinking:

- Firstly, most of automotive innovation centers around the one thing a modern EV does not have and does not need: the up to 10,000 moving parts an ICE car has. You can measure this by looking at the patents car makers are filing. A Tesla Model S on the other hand has less than 150 moving parts ... Put differently: ICE automotive is innovating the wrong things, on the wrong platforms.
- Secondly, most of the competition between ICE car makers was on their own terms of building an ICE car. For 100 years they have not faced a real, disruptive competitive threat and they are 110% unprepared for it structurally.
- Third, when it comes to the *real* features that consumers care about, which is interior design, comfort and infotainment then traditional ICE automotive is somewhere between ""meh"" and ""god awful bad"". I mean when even Google's ""Android Auto"" can make for a better infotainment experience then you know you are in trouble! Look at [the interior of the top of the line Mercedes SUV](https://mediaserver.mbusa.com/iris/iris?client=mb&brand=mbusa&resp=err_status%2Cjpeg&quality=90&vehicle=2017_gls550w4&pov=centerpano%2Ccgd&paint=2_040&fabric=4_211&sa=0_235%2C0_289%2C0_581%2C0_731%2C0_810%2C0_846%2C9_319%2C9_996%2C9_p01&hfov=110&pitch=18&angle=17&width=1440&height=600). I could very well imagine that picture being taken 50 years ago and maybe with the exception of the (awfully placed and sized) LCD screen not notice the difference. The ""innovation"" in this area is largely non-existent.
- Fourth, as a result of all that there are a *lot* of institutional legacies attached to the ""ICE"" part: 98% of the mechanical complexity of an ICE car is going the way of the dinosaurs, while the people and institutions attached to manufacturing that complexity don't want to go away. Opel is just one example of an ICE manufacturer who outright *reversed* an EV transition a few years ago (and belatedly started an EV division this year ....) - and the rest are dragging their feet as well. Let's look at Daimler AG: 70% of the half a million employees are related to the ""ICE mechanical"" part of manufacturing. You think they will be required on the EV side? You think they'll give up easily when let go?

Maybe Chinese car makers will end up ruling the world and/or Tesla messes up - but one thing is certain: established U.S. and European car makers are in big institutional trouble and there's very little they can do about it.

I could go to the mall near my home and ask people and I'd bet that majority of people would say, ""With what money?"" but I could go to the mall 45 minutes away where middle/middle and upper/middle class people shop and a lot would say yes.

I'm all for EV's and hope by 2025 to see the majority of the road with EV's but I'm more of a realist and know it will not happen unless huge changes take place.

2 of the major changes, more places adapting and installing charging stations and price..... that price."
"I know you're probably trying to be encouraging, but this feels a bit patronizing. I can probably set a goal and work hard and earn $200k, but that doesn't mean that the best use for that money is to blow it on a car. I would need to have already saved/invested a lot more than $200k in order to get to that point, and that's something that I feel is currently way out of reach."
"Someone over in /r/electricvehicles did the math and a 40KWH pack would give a retrofitted gen 1 Miata 300 miles of range.  An MG or TR3B would go forever on 50kwh!  Something like that would be a dream to cruise in, too."
"> Econoboxes sometime get into the 600'

Don't believe them either.  I had a couple of Prius cars that claimed that much range, but realistically I never saw more than 380 miles - the range loss was worse than my Tesla on its coldest wettest day.  I think Prius had issues with a soft bladder fuel tank that could never be fully fueled up, but my dealership never wanted to fix either car so I just assumed their fuel capacity was a lie.  "

"...and pay the penalty of higher fuel consumption and higher CO2 emissions. Both affect the running costs of the car.

Thinking about it, Toyota were in the best place to make the transition to EV. You might say that their hybrid solution was too successful. "
"That line of thinking got us Crocs...

Thanks but no thanks."
"And that is what put you firmly in the Prius and volt buyers bucket.

And why 95% or more buyers wouldn’t take either of those cars is they were given to them as a gift. Because it is a fashion accessory. It’s screams your status from the heavens.

Hence why Tesla does/can do so well. *most* people want in i8 on a bolt budget. Enter the model 3.

Wait until you can pick up model 3’s for half what they cost now. You won’t find Prius taxi’s anymore - they’ll be Tesla’s.

Or hopefully once Tesla has sorted out the majority of its issues and Mercedes works out how you make 50’000 electric cars a month we’ll all just be driving around in something we like, with great capacity, fast charge and the ability to do 0-100 in 3 seconds if you want. Colour choice optional.

"Yes, I actually live in China right now and the efforts are noticeable. A long ways to go but each year the pollution is getting better.

Their investment into solar energy on a chart looks like US military spending on a chart....way more than anyone else in the world.

I see lots of Tesla's here too."
"There is evidence on which to ~~base~~ evaluate your opinion.  u/GlebeKensington linked a 2-year-old article showing regional variations, but the grid has gotten MUCH cleaner since then.

I plugged a Chevy Bolt like mine into Minneapolis, Nebraska, and West Virginia, and all made less than half the CO2 of a gas car, and somewhat less than even a plug-in-hybrid.

That’s a myth sold by auto and oil companies
"You are 100% right. Self-driving cars are not going to make anything cheaper. And it isn't going to change car ownership much more than ride sharing currently has.

I personally don't want to have to carry all my shit with me everytime I get to a destination."
"Hello

99% of people do not see this disruption coming. batteries, self-driving tech, electric vehicles are going to become so cheap.

EVs have 18 moving parts and require almost no maintance.  soon they will be lasting 1 million miles.  batteries keep dropping in price by 16% year.  they last longer every year.  they charge faster every year.

robotics, AI, manufacturing keeps dropping in price.  the rate of innovation is accelerating.

Charging stations are irrelevant. The two changes that need to take place are *600-mile EPA range*, and *price parity*."
I have Crocs too lol. They're comfy!
"The Prius sells extremely well though, it's because to a lot of people cars are just methods of transportation.

Dont get me wrong. I love Teslas. I'm patiently waiting for my invite to order. But if it was uglier than it is now, it's not going to deter me from ordering one. I'm buying it because it's electric, has cool gadgets and gets continually improved via OTA updates and auto pilot."
"They are actually quite smart. From the outside the effort might look as pushing for greener planet, but in fact this direction makes huge economical/geopolitical sense. 

They build energy system independent from fossil fuels. They remove the factor of oil supply from their political decision making all together. "
How big are the improvements?
"This is something that the policy makers in the United States needs to understand. money used to subsidize renewable energy and technologies generates more return than coal or oil. The reason why the US doesn't do this is because the oil and gas lobby is allowed to buy policy makers and keep legislation locked down in their favor. 

When you factor in the environmental gains as well (reduced CO2 emissions, reduced pollution, a healthier population), it makes much more sense to invest in green tech rather than fossil fuels."
That’s so encouraging to hear! The day can’t come fast enough where our cars/homes and lives are powered by clean energy. 
I didn't realize that some had solor rooftops I would like to see all body panels made of solar But that would cost a pretty penny also thank you for replying instead of just downvoting
"I'm not against per  say (sorry can't think of how to properly spell that) but I just try to factor in where te energy is coming from

Umm no no it's not http://www2.cec.org/site/PPE/fossil-fuels WE DO use fossil fuels to create electricity there's no disputing that unless your pulling electricity out of your add those plants are there for a reason they are not a hood  ornament yes we do get power from solar hydro and wind however the majority comes from fossil fuels 
[deleted]
From a recent report I read somewhere- the fog disappeared in many cities. For a reference- remember the Beijing Olympics? It was awful. 
Huge...still too much pollution but Beijing is no longer in the top 100 polluted cities in the world. When I lived in Beijing the air quality was so bad there were days I couldn't see more than 10 feet in front of me. They have made changes to iron out such huge pollution spikes like that and overall pollution each year is falling.
"Absolutely!  It's always important to respect one another and acknowledge that technology is moving so fast that not everyone has had a chance to research the latest progress.

And to be clear, the solar panels are on my house, not my car.  The amount of panels you can fit on a car--even ignoring cost--is marginally useful, especially if you park in garages for example.  But on my house, they get sun 100% of the time, and my utility gives me net metering credits which I use at night to charge my car.

Some folks are trying, of course!  We all hope [Sono Motors](https://inhabitat.com/sono-motors-unveils-the-14000-sion-solar-powered-car/) and their solar-body car will turn out to be more than just vaporware."
"Sure, even if you do and it’s coal or another fossil fuel it’s not as bad as traditional automobiles. To the other point made, fossil fuels aren’t used as often and will continually be declining in use. "
">Umm no no it's not 

Here is a thorough debunking of the myth

https://cleantechnica.com/2018/02/19/electric-car-well-to-wheel-emissions-myth/

Excerpt 

>A favorite fib is that electric cars pollute the environment just as much as conventional cars do. Let’s blow that myth out of the water right now by looking at the facts, not the lies the car companies and fossil fuel interests want you to believe. The Union of Concerned Scientists has done a thorough study about this that took two years to complete.

>The scientists wanted to know exactly how many emissions conventional cars were responsible for and how many emissions electric cars were responsible for. It’s conclusion? “We found that battery electric cars generate half the emissions of the average comparable gasoline car, even when pollution from battery manufacturing is accounted for.” **Half.**"
China will still need Germany for microprocessors and factory robotics for quite some time. For energy you are absolutely right and once they build significant domestic energy systems it will push cost down enough for them to sell it (solar especially) to the developing world at scale.
Yea didn't they stop cars for a week in advance of the Olympic
That's great I always felt like China's ability to solve problems was one of the best
"Ah on your house sorry I wish I could put them on my whole roof of my house but I live in Canada where there’s snow my solution is to make panels with the same kind of wire heater as what’s in trucks but I have no clue if that’s available 

   I have a large bias in electric vs internal combustion engine towards the gasoline ones just because I’m a mechanic in small engines (but I’ve also fixed electric motors) and I’m also a fan of older cars ex gas gussling impalas studabakers GTOs model As ect 

But personally I don’t believe electric will take over until the next 40 years and I don’t believe Tesla as a company had a future in it but I believe they’re started the revolution "
Diesel fuel was traditionally made from beets however they pollute 4x that of gasoline engines fossil fuel to make  electricity  is the only thing in my area however I am hoping they integrate solar or hydro soon
I didn't say that electric cars have emissions  I said that power plants are prodominitly ran with fossil fuels and sorry I edited my previous comment to included more on what I was talking about I finished right before you sent yours please refer back and thank you 
"I AM NOT saying electric cars have near the amount of emissions however the electricity  doesnt just come from nowhere solar hydro and wind are used for power however the VAST MAJORITY of power plants run  on FOSSIL FUELS I.e coal natural gas crude petrol products  (sorry for my reply taking so long I have to wait as I am ""commenting too much"")"
Microprocessors? Wouldn't China have the knowledge to do this by now?
"Fun fact:  Snow slides off solar panels!  And according to this website, the months they are most likely to be obscured by snow, they would not be producing much power anyways because the sun is so low in the sky.  http://quebecsolar.ca/how-do-solar-panels-perform-in-winter-conditions/  Of course they will still produce less power overall than they would in the south, so run the numbers for your situation.

I know plenty of guys who enjoy working on combustion engines--it's a cool piece of technology.  But I hope they make their daily driver electric soon.  If you aren't planning for the global economy to be carbon-neutral by 2050, you better be planning for some epic climate change instead.  We only get to choose one or the other."
">it's almost useless to drive electric

Driving electric reduces emissions by 50 percent, that’s hardly useless. You may not know that net efficiency of non hybrid ICE cars is 20 percent. Natural gas power plants (the largest single source of fossil fuel generation in the US) are at 44 percent. Power generation in the US is at 0.6 kg per kWh, at 4.4 miles per kWh an EV traveling 30 miles would be responsible for 4 kg of CO2. A 30 mpg ICE car emits 10 kg over that same distance.

Edit, 0.6 kg per kWh 

"
">it's almost useless to drive electric

Cutting emissions by 50 percent is hardly useless"
"Possibly, but currently China imports massive amounts of high technology which are then assembled into the ""made in China"" electronics that we know and love. Right now Germany, the Netherlands, and South Korea are the primary producers of integrated circuits and micro processors for China.

EDIT: There is also significant chip manufacturing capacity in the US, Japan, and Taiwan."
It’s not practical to drive electric in my location the closet large centre is 600km away and they only have around 10000 people I don’t even think. There’s a Tesla dealership for 5000000 kilometres
"You're  not cutting emissions by 50 percent. you're  cutting your own emissions by 50percent assuming
 electric cars(not hybrids) are even  say 20 out of 100 cars your emissions will have 90 percent of the same emissions as  the previous year if  people weren't lazy and walked or biked for half the time they go to work you would end up with the same results(at a 2/10 rate) (personally I bike to school) 

 "
"> currently China imports massive amounts of high technology which are then assembled into the ""made in China"" electronics that we know and love

This makes total sense. You were probably right. "
I’m glad that you agree that it is a myth that an EV emits as much CO2 as an ICE car.  In fact an EV produces half the emissions of an ICE car
"I’m glad we can both agree it’s a myth at least we have some common ground oh I just read the tag thing by your name what are you invested in

"Thread of conversation:

[MKBHD - True, the “dry” questions in this case were asked by investors, who have every right to be super angry. And they totally are.](https://twitter.com/mkbhd/status/992037074550353921?s=21) 

[Elon - The “dry” questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/992333108346277888?s=21) 

[Elon - To be clear, I’m a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/992337618091298816?s=21) 

[User - (Summary) Good questions came after that. It weeded out some bad investors and now long haul investors will come in. Stock should have gone up instead.](https://twitter.com/thephoenixflare/status/992339626802085888?s=21) 

[Elon - Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S & X are producing major positive cash flow & Model 3 is about to do same.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/992341387613016064?s=21) 

[User - That's not the issue. The fact that you were clearly unable or unwilling to give a straight answer to valid and pertinent cash flow questions is a huge red flag to any investor.](https://twitter.com/ataraxia_invest/status/992343295782277125?s=21) 

[Elon - They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/992354361975042048?s=21) 

[Elon - First, it’s important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market & has been for a while
](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/992362594961780742?s=21) 

[The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/992367087761817600?s=21) 

User - If you know their negative angle beforehand, just block them in the queue then so you never have to hear such questions live. Problem solved.

[Elon - True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/992381848104747008?s=21) 

[The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/992372195304198144?s=21) 

[Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising & no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/992374493132742656?s=21) 

User - In fairness to RBC, I think there is a ‘kickstarter’ like issue of hype vs sustainability. It is good to know what indications you have that there is sustainable demand for a mass market product.

[Elon - We went through the same drama on S & X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/992378642830262272?s=21) 

Fred - The take would make Tesla look bad, but it's not actually representative of demand because Tesla is only producing one configuration of the Model 3 right now. So of course res holders who want AWD, standard battery, non-premium package, are all deciding not to order.

User - Basically take rate is orders now plus deferred for other configuration minus cancellations, probably in the high 90%.

Elon - Yup

[Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/992388944774938626?s=21) "
"The two analysts that Musk cut off were Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein and Joseph Spak from RBC Capital.

Sacconaghi is one of the top-ranked analysts on Tipranks and while he indeed never recommended Tesla’s stock, he has a ‘hold’ rating on it with a $265 price target. With this said, Sacconaghi did publish a note to clients a month ago claiming that the Model 3 order take rate was low among Tesla owners, which was misleading since it’s based on only one configuration currently available.

As for Spak, he is also ranked high on Tipranks and he also has a ‘hold’ rating on Tesla’s stock – with a price target of $305.

While neither analysts can be considered a ‘Tesla bull’, they haven’t really been contributing much to the short seller thesis on Tesla.

Interestingly, Spak's question that was cut off sounded like a clarification on Sacconaghi's previously mentioned note, which again was stupid.

I think Musk is misinformed about those guys' intentions. But with this said, I do also think that the questions were quite useless. "
So Elon couldn’t parry the analysts with diplomacy? Short temper is the answer?
"I don't give a fuck who is asking the question ""How many of the preorders customers have started to customize their car"" - It's a legitimate question."
"> Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC

> Thank you. The first question is related to the Model 3 reservations, and I was just wondering if you gave us a gauge as maybe some of the impact that the news has had. Like, of the reservations that actually opened and made available to configure, can you let us know, like, what percentage have actually taken the step to configure?

> Elon Reeve Musk - Tesla, Inc.

> We're going to go to YouTube. Sorry. These questions are so dry. They're killing me.

Joseph Spak has a hold rating on Tesla: https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/joseph-spak

Being sell-side does not mean someone is a short seller or is betting against the company.  Elon Musk knows this.  Why is he doubling down by lying about these analysts instead of just apologizing for acting like an ass?  "
"In the call I learned that China will allow a wholly Tesla owned factory on their soil.  

The mainstream press is focusing too much on Elon's unwise rudeness."
More proof that Elon doesn't know what he's talking about. Sell-side analysts sell information and stock ratings to institutional investors (known as the buy side). All analysts that are not part of some larger hedge fund are sell-side analysts. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sell_side
"Tesla's excellent products have helped the company through rough PR patches like this before, and I suspect the same will happen again. People will buy the products regardless of their stance on Musk. Also, go directly to the source material. There's nothing ""bizarre."" He ran out of patience for henpecking questions, regardless of their merit."

@elonmusk always identifies the problem and reacts to it. This is the basic development loop.
"His excuse for the Model 3 reservations question is straight BS.

Edit: And now I have a temp ban. What a great Friday, first stock rises 2%, then I get a ban :/"
"How many times have investor been wrong about Tesla, judging Tesla by existing metric have failed so many times in past, lesson to be learned again , I've found the best approach is any normal company in Tesla situation now, huge red flag and probably die, but Tesla is not normal company.

Did musk behave badly on the call , personally yes but it shit to assume someone like musk is an angel, am I a cult absolutely, so is everyone conscious or unconsciously like I don't lose if he fails and gain if he wins but for more than anything to realise existing rules are man made ,today absurdities are tomorrow standard"

"I’m surprised they took he questions knowing that they were sell side analysts unless they did this on purpose. There were likely dozens of other friendlies on the call with “nicer” questions so they didn’t have to do this. 

This feels to me like a purposeful jab, kind of like the April Fool’s joke about bankruptcy. On the one had institutional investors who see Tesla only for the money it can make probably don’t care much for shenanigans. On the other hand, he has liability if they do end up needing significant capital, so he must be pretty confident they don’t because investors (and their lawyers) would seek blood. 

The existential risk was that the Model 3 was a dud. Having become an owner this week, this car exceeds my expectations and feels like a paradigm shift from a flip phone to an advanced smart phone. It will be hard for traditional automakers to make this jump without devaluing all of their standard cars. They will be tempted to hold on too long. 

"
"So the question wasn't about how many reservations there were it was about how many people who have been invited have been converted into sales. Elon is rewriting history here in hopes that his cult will willfully and blissfully ignore the skeptical investors. Which, judging by this subreddit, they will.

I'd also like to take this moment to note that a market is made up of people who buy and sell meaning that short sellers are also investors they just think the stock price is going to go down from the current value. This does not make them not investors in fact the fact that he would claim as much should concern you because he either has a fundamental misunderstanding of how the stock market works or he's lying. Personally I think he's too smart to not understand how it works so I'm going to take the latter explanation.

As someone who was a day 0 line waiter for the 3 and overall fan of his mission I wish he would not go down the trumpian path of using Twitter to try to obfuscate and distract followers from whats actually going on. As a fan I think it's a really bad look and is insulting to the intelligence of people who've been following him and supporting him. I think people need to wake up to the reality of what the challenge is that he's facing and maybe he over reached and over-promised and now he's in trouble based on his personal Leverage through his companies. See that's the thing about short sellers is they'll tell you the truth as they see it which is what you don't get on CNBC. People don't like the truth they want to be told Pretty Lies that's why religions exist. I find holy ironic that these followers of his that are so-called quote fans of science unquote wouldn't look at the evidence.

Note I have no position in the company either way from a stock perspective. I will also say that I no longer have $1,000 deposit with the company. That's partially based on his behavior and partially recent events in my own life. 

The only reason I'm spending the time to make this comment is that I think people should really reassess from a sober standpoint."

"> the Model 3 order take rate was low among Tesla owners, which was misleading since it’s based on only one configuration currently available.

It isn't misleading at all. He is stating the take rate of what Tesla currently sells. At the point the SR comes out, he will make statements about that take rate vs. others in order to build a financial model

How can you have a hold rating with a price target 40$ lower than market (assuming this rating was before the call)?
Nah. They were really important since the conversion rate of reservations to sales is all that matters.

"Why is it a legitimate question? It's basically irrelevant because they have hundreds of thousands of more orders than they can fulfill, and it will remain that way for a long time."
"This is what he said about that:
“Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising & no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0.”"
"He should have just said, ""that's not a metric we are concerned with tracking since we obviously are trying to keep up with overwhelming demand, which is our priority."" "
Also I am interested in the possible gigawatt battery project they may be announcing.  I don't recall seeing any projections about profit margins on the battery projects.  Anyone have details?
It's because dramatic narratives that can be pinned to characters sell better than anything else.
"Don't project the ignorance of people on r/TeslaMotors to Elon Musk. Elon knows what a sell side analyst does. Being a CEO of a major public company means you are working with sell side analysts all the time.

If you wanted to defend Elon here, you could point out that analyst recommendations are always bull\-biased, so a hold recommendation and a lower PT than the current price is actually moderately bearish. His statement that they have a short thesis is not entirely inaccurate."
If that number makes Tesla look bad investors damn well should know about it.  It goes directly to the company's future profitability - why shouldn't investors ask about that?
"Yes but if true ... what does it mean?

1) model S /X owners already have a car.

2) They are waiting for AWD.

3) They are waiting for the base model.

Do analysts ask other car companies about the mix of models they expect to sell?

The only reason to ask is for the opportunity to spin the answer as bad news.

They don't know the margins Tesla will make on particular models."
Agree this was a trap. Elon avoided it but the analyst could have sensationalized the fact the a good number of reservation holders are waiting for cheaper options or awd. The metric has no meaning until all options are available. More so technically the 35k car hasn’t arrived yet so why do we expect the same take rate.
"Lol what?! Being an ass to potential investors is justified because he is ""building a better toaster""?

"> I’m surprised they took he questions knowing that they were sell side analysts unless they did this on purpose.

Jesus fucking Christ.  Do you know what being a sell-side analyst even means?  Here is the definition from wiki:

> A sell-side analyst works for a brokerage firm and evaluates companies for future earnings growth and other investment criteria. They sometimes place recommendations on stocks or other securities, typically phrased as ""buy"", ""sell"", or ""hold."" They offer their recommendations to clients. A proper title for some sell-side analysts is Equity Research Analyst.

This is as opposed to a buy-side analyst:

> A buy-side analyst typically works in a mutual fund, pension fund, or other non-brokerage firm, and provides research and recommendations exclusively for the benefit of the company's own money managers (as opposed to individual investors).  

Being a sell-side analyst does NOT mean you are betting against a company.  The analysts he is talking about are not betting against the company.  Both of the analysts that asked questions that Musk ignored have hold recommendations on the stock, not sells.  Elon Musk knows this.  And he makes shit up and lies about people, and people like you believe him."
Conference call questions are usually like 90% sell-side analysts. Buy side guys don't like to ask questions in front of other buy side guys (can give away their strategy/thoughts on the company). The fact that these were sell-side guys doesn't really mean anything. The fact that they have short positions is the important piece.
"A sell-side analyst doesn't mean that they're shorting the stock, they're just selling their knowledge and research to clients, not infinitely short selling stocks. In this case Elon just meant that these particular analysts had a theory that Tesla may be overvalued, but that doesn't mean that their questions are invalid, they're trying to do research for their firm."
"A sell side analyst can be bullish aka Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley. Sell side simply means they provide their views to institutions who actually buy or sell the stock. A sell side analyst is typically a bank and a buy side analyst is typically someone at a hedge fund, pension fund etc. "
Kind of like shorting the shorters so that those investing for long can buy more on the shorters' bets.
"> short sellers are also investor

No, successful [Tesla] short sellers are **parasites**, full stop - they have no positive economic function whatsoever - any profit shorts make is at the expense of:

- real investors and longs
- employees of Tesla
- customers of Tesla

In fact many forms of short positions that are used in the U.S. are **illegal** in other advanced economies and many of the current shorts  would be plain criminals there.

> short sellers are also investors they just think the stock price is going to go down from the current value.

""Short sellers are investors too"" is ""war is peace"" kind of nonsensical new-speak: they are investors in the same way the Barbarians who sacked Rome were also 'city builders', they just disagreed about which direction the walls should grow!

[deleted]
"> short sellers are also investors

How are short sellers count as investors? Do you know how short selling work? 

They have to borrow the stock first from brokerage firms or from others who would lend it to them, and they buy it back later at a cheaper price. When you initial a short position, you don't own anything. It's like someone loan you a brand new car without an interest, and you use it to depreciate its value and sell it back to him later at some point."

"This whole thread is just trying to justify what Musk did.

"> the question about reservation conversions at this stage is pretty pointless

It becomes less pointless in my mind if you consider how important the number of reservations made were a few months back..."
"When trying to put myself in Elon’s shoes I absolutely understand his impatience. He is constantly trying to fix inefficiencies. As you can see on the email to Tesla’s employees that leaked recently. For example he said: don’t follow chain of command, talk directly to who you need. Don’t use acronyms, they confuse people and waste time. Remove all meetings that are not absolutely necessary. Get out of the meetings the second they are no longer relevant to you. Etc. Elon is constantly trying to optimize every minute of his life and his employees work. If I was in that mindset and someone was asking questions that I either already answered or seemed useless, I would absolutely cut them off and move to the next one. No time to waste. I got shit to do. Next! 

Having said that, if I was in the mindset of a short term investor, I would have sold the stock on the spot as well. My mindset however is in the looooong term. So I am loving these dips. TSLA on sale!"
I'm saying that the note was misleading because it didn't mention that. It just said that the current take rate lead to believe that current Tesla owners who reserved the Model 3 weren't actually interested.
Anything less than 15% either side of the current price is a hold.
They've got a gigantic backlog of orders and haven't been marketing the car (at one point were even un-selling it in favor of Models S+X). One could make a much better case that production is all that matters now -- and that is an important risk factor for Tesla (a real one).
Who cares? Demand is do high that's the priority first. They don't need to worries about sales
"He’s always hated shorts. More than a decade ago, when nothing he owned was publicly traded or close to becoming publicly traded, he still talked extremely negatively about shorts when the general topic came up in interviews.

He’s been pissed off about Tesla shorts since day one. People just pay more attention to his statements and tweets now, but he’s always been riled by them and he’s always been vocal about that.

Rightly or wrongly, he simply loathes the attitude of actively betting against a positive outcome."
"I think you are overlooking the fact that Elon is simply a super competitive person who holds a serious grudge against people who want his companies to fail. And that's not hyperbole. There are plenty of people who simply want him to fail and go bankrupt. Bloomberg had a great article a couple years ago called Elon Musk vs the trolls. Look it up, there are a ton of weirdos out there who go after him constantly. 

I'm not defending his behavior during the conference call, but I don't think it means the company is about to go bankrupt simply because he's tired of some of this shit. The guy's life sounds like a living hell right now, and then he has to go out there and defend himself against people who he perceives are looking to prove at a failure thesis. This is why he needs the CFO to handle these calls, not himself."
"The thing about Elon is that he isn't cut from the same cloth as other CEO's. He is an awkward coder, and always will be. While his behavior shouldn't be justified like it is on this sub-reddit we need to keep in mind he isn't typical. 

This had me worried, but then again he has come back from much worse. Every single project he has come with has been met with resistance, and he hasn't let me down yet. It will all blow over next week. "
"I think Elon should go on a 1\-2 weeks vacation. He seems absolutely demolished mentally and physically, and honestly from this and the interview on MSNBC or whatever the network was with the plant tour, he looks like he's a walking zombie. I think the overwork is taking a serious toll on his mental health, and it's starting to show in moments where it shouldn't.

Tesla can survice a week or two without him."
"There’s some good analysis in here, but you fail to account for how far beyond the bell curve of human energy/focus/exhaustion/anxiety/etc Elon is operating. He’s running multiple revolutionary companies at once. He can get anyone in a room to get shit done at any moment. And he has to sit on a phone call with some hack analyst looking to make a quick buck after a full day of actually fucking executing and you think it’s a red flag that he can’t find a whole new gas tank of patience, positivity, and bullshit for these guys? I think the even better argument is these guys don’t deserve a fluffy response. Their goal is to paint Tesla in as bad a light as they can in the short term to make money. Elon doesn’t owe them shit. You can’t prove that a CEO is more effective if they are a bullshitter who pulls punches. Elon is doing things no one has ever done, so who’s to say the best leader in his context is a calm peaceful yes man, or a passionate heated honest no bull shit engineer? Any, literally any, CEO you could name as an example is irrelevant because they haven’t pulled off even half of Elon’s monthly output on a consistent basis "
"I would lose my patience too if I was directly dealing with technical issues and having long nights at a factory with little sleep and a bunch of things to do. Not like other CEOs that would sit behind a desk, on the phone, delegate, and blame others for failures. 

Contrary to what many believe I do think the guy is actually human. I like his authenticity to include his weaknesses. No fake political covers and filters.

Isn't he doing an amazing job at all of his companies? Investors should probably just trust him a little more. They and the company will be fine.

I think a company is in bigger trouble when they make more stuff than they can sell than when it's the opposite. I also think there is a lot of drama and that hardly anyone truly believes the company is in trouble."
"The percentage of people customizing their pre-orders is a good indicator of how many people are more serious than the rest.

Moreover, they will make more money with more people customizing their Tesla with more options.

It's a legitimate question."
"That does not answer the question.  The question is not about demand for the Model 3, it is about demand for the $55k variant of the Model 3 which is the one where Tesla actually earns a decent margin.  If there is not much demand for that variant of the car (evidenced by a high deferral rate as people wait for cheaper variants to become available), the company will be less profitable."
"That’s still not an answer

Musk was asked about the conversion rate for current reservation holders. 

Musk has attempted to justify why he doesn’t need to provide an answer, instead of answering the question"
People never bothered since their main rev was from automotive. A project of this scale may finally make people care..
"Agreed. Instead of running from the question, Elon should have just answered it and noted that the take rate is low because a lot of people are waiting for AWD, standard battery, etc.

It doesn't make sense for Tesla to parade around their reservation numbers but then act like conversion rate doesn't matter."
Because some people bought an S or an X. Some people are waiting for a MORE expensive version. It’s not relevant without knowing exactly why people did what they did so instead of putting out vague unknown numbers that could and would be skewed he didn’t answer. 
"Sacconaghi's question was also quite stupid, the letter mentions capex projections, Deepak re-iterated, and he asked the question of how much capex AGAIN in a skeptical manner, as if what they had re-iterated was pretty much bullshit IMO. 

Spak's question would be misleading, but I think he probably should've answered that one and gave the reasoning, although it would probably be blown up in a negative way."
">Do analysts ask other car companies about the mix of models they expect to sell?

Yes. All the time. This is, like, the cornerstone of valuation models. "
"> Do analysts ask other car companies about the mix of models they expect to sell?

Have you ever listened to an earnings call for an auto manufacturer before?  "
"I agree with you, but I don't believe this analyst in particular was being negative on Tesla, it's just that the question he's asking is going to be used against Tesla. Elon already knows anything he says is going to be spun negatively, hence he refrained from answering this question and giving the short sellers ammunition. "
Asking the company for pertinent information about its future profitability is a trap?  Are you serious?  
"I don't think musk cares about the investors. He would probably love the stock value to tank so he can sell a tiny bit of SpaceX and take Tesla back private. I think he went public because he had to in order to keep the company afloat. If investors don't know that, they've fallen down on the job. It's a weird situation, since most CEOs' only goal is stock value growth, but musk just wants make great electric cars profitable, which has the side effect of making investors money. "

You just realized this?
"The ""analysts"" being cut off were not investors, they were short sellers looking for soundbites to use as a tool to bring TSLA down."
"He doesn’t have ‘PayPal billions’. He made about 180 million from the PayPal sale, which was almost entirely put into Tesla and SpaceX.
"
"I'm sure he would if he could, but even his personal fortune isn't enough to get Tesla off the ground."
Stay classy!
"> Tesla CANNOT make a profit.

Source?"
"Really, that isn't my recollection.  If Tesla was not investing in a Gigafactory, Supercharger network and development of the next vehicle (the 3, the Y, The Semi, the Roadster) maybe the S & X would generate a profit but you can't do all of those things which will pay off in the future without spending all of your profits and more."
"""Tesla doesn't make a profit to grow, has an operational loss and has to leverage debt just to operate let alone expand.""

Nope, most of the recent capex is growth capex put into PP&E, not SG&A. Spending to grow."
The  man is literally launching rockets into space. He dose not have time to deal with trolls with money. He answered every queston his investors had and told the trolls to screw off.

"As I mentioned elsewhere in the thread, I miswrote. Brutal crowd here today :). "
"Ummm...Bernsteins price target on Tesla is $265. If you own the stock at $300, that is a recommendation to sell. ""Market perform"" is not the same as hold. Both questions asked were targetting sound bites for negative articles. Musk could have said they now have 2 million reservations and the articles would have been about how most of them would change their mind after waiting too long."

I think what Elon referring to was even though both analysts' rating are neutral, which they are suppose to trying to be objective as possible, the two firms which sell-side analysts working for are both short. Look it up.

This is an exact opposite to the Goldman Sach's analyst, who has a ""SELL"" rating on the stock, but Goldman is not short Tesla as a matter of fact. Goldman actually longs Tesla stocks, which was why everyone calling out that Goldman's analyst a tool, with his horrible track records."

Musk wasn’t saying they are shorts because they are sell-side. He said they are both. 
"I should have phrased the statement differently to specify that I'm surprised that they took the questions based on the short position, not simply because they were on the sell side. I appreciate the correction. 

With that said there's no need to be nasty here. I found his comments off putting and immature like I did the April fool's joke, for the record, and was just speculating. "
I'm surprised so many people think they actually know what they're f****** talking about when they have no f****** clue
THANK YOU - Bernstein has had a HOLD on Tesla for months!!
im inclined not to believe the guy who does nothing but trash tesla in teslamotors. also gilding in hopes of garner more credibility? lol. nice try.
"Agree with you. Getting upset at analysts who have a price target lower than the current price is absurd. Especially when Musk has admitted several times that Tesla is overvalued. Regardless, the financial investing world doesn't exist to promote Tesla... it's to provide analysts with the necessary info to make their recommendations.  

Musk is wrong here and should really stop talking about it."
It was sloppy writing on my part. In my head I was thinking shorts but I wrote sell side analysts. Appreciate the correction (and thanks to others that have pointed this out :). 
"Short sellers do have an important function in the market, the problem is that they aren't always right about a company's futures prospects and once they have a short position, they may take some unsavory steps (e.g. concentrated FUD blitz) to make sure they 'win.'  There are fraudulent companies out there and they do deserve the be shorted in the interested of the investing public.

Unfortunately, many analysts see Elon as a con man. Like Steve Jobs, he uses superlatives for PR purposes and this can rub people the wrong way. I still remember how Steve would say PowerPCs were the best CPUs despite Intel kicking their ass."
"Short sellers actually benefit longs. For one thing they allow you to buy the stock more cheaply since they're willing to sell it to you. If they're wrong they lose money and you make money. Not only because they pushed the price down so you bought in more cheaply but also because if they're spectacularly wrong they'll trigger a short squeeze trying to cover.

Shorts also provide liquidity in the market, if nobody sold the markets would have very poor liquidity so anybody trying to buy the stock would excessively pump up the price without shorts being willing to sell to them. The stock markets would look like Bitcoin during the 2013 bubble, with higher prices causing less people to be willing to sell, causing the price to go even higher due to poor liquidity. You don't really want random equities to run up like crazy like that."
"No you actually have no idea what you're talking about which is sad. I have multiple degrees in this subject which is basically capital markets. Clearly you don't know what you're talking about. I don't care if you think you do, you don't.

Markets are supposed to have 2 sides. A buy side and a sell side. If the buy side goes crazy (like it has for Tesla stock and many others in the past(I'm not attacking Tesla I'm trying to explain how markets work)), then it makes sense to sell short because you think someone is overpaying for the stock no matter what the underlying company is. Fundementals are supposed to rule the day. Now what you've been living thru for your entire life thanks to the Federal reserve system, is a distorted view on how things should be. Interest rates, that is to say the cost of money, have been structurally supressed by the banking system in most developed countries which allows for lots of cheap money and causes malinvestment. Malinvestment means investments that wouldn't have otherwise been made in a normal functioning market but are made because the rate environment causes what formally would have made no sense to do financially look like the only rational choice now. 

So once you've understood all that you can see where a historically low interest rate environment can lead to systemic malinvestment, which it of course has, because the Fed actually isn't some God but is made up of fallible humans just like you and me. 

Couple that with CNBC always pumping everything and you have an enviroment that is rampant with fraud, but the fraud isn't really the companies fault it's the Fed's because they make money up out of nothing and then use that money to monitize their debt. Which is now staggeringly high. the USD/GDP is at all time highs. This is very bad and will only get worse. 

I suggest you take the time to figure it out. It's really not that hard but you have not just not trust things on their face, you have to have enough drive and intellectual curiosity to suss it out. And also don't just think you're right because you're thinking it. You have to actually test your theory. We're all living thru a big theoretical test right now and Tesla is just one fish swimming in it. 

"
"A competent CEO will take on the challenging questions and make his case for why the the future is brighter than the naysayers predict it to be. Failing to engage looks weak. It signals either lack of ability to handle confrontation (probably not the case with Elon) or lack of a reasonable factual counter argument, which is obviously worrisome."
"> Not sure why any CEO would entertain people who think their stock is overvalued, regardless of whether or not they have valid points or questions.

Elon himself has historically thought his stock is overvalued. If you want to keep getting loans and enticing investors, you need to be able to convince people of the value of your company."
Well why can't he answer the questions? They're fundamental questions about the business. So when you don't answer them people wonder why. 
"Lol 

Oh so the mechanics of the trade makes someone not an investor? Do you know how investing works? It doesn't seem like it."
Short interest is extremely highly correlated with future stock underperformance. So be careful with looking for short squeezes unless you have some other reason to be long.
Even if they had shorts on Tesla: In this case he gave them exactly what they want. A terrible answer on a good question. He failed.
"I am no market genius but I had to laugh at all the hand wringing yesterday about the stock dropping in response to Musk's performance. No serious investor is going to sell their stock because Elon told a couple analysts to fuck off. And no serious analyst would have ever expected Tesla to divulge the take rate. That metric would only be spun to make the company look bad if it was any number short of 100%, despite the fact that it has little bearing on reality given the phased roll out of Model 3. 

I assumed yesterday the stock would bounce right back today, and sure enough it did. This is much ado about nothing. The real fireworks will be in the next 6 months depending on whether or not Elon's profitability projections come true."
"That's because it doesn't really matter so much for the bottom line of Apple. They have huge profit margins for every product they sell and they don't have a multiple year pre order list they are working off. With Tesla it matters because in the car business margins on any car except for the luxury market are extremely low. Generally profits are mostly made with options. 

A base Model 3 with no options is not going to make them any profits. If they are really lucky they break even, but more likely they will actually ultimately lose money on each sale. A $40k car still probably is just breaking even at best. Maybe $1000 net profits, if they are lucky. Estimates are currently that at best the base version of the car has to cost like $41k before it's profitable. Since battery prices are constantly dropping, that number might get lower, but costs for other material is going up, so who knows. Plus, getting rid of the EAP computer on non EAP cars and getting rid of extra hardware that is only needed for AWD would help quite a bit. I would say there is a high chance Tesla will either scrap the base version all together or increase price by a few thousand dollars, but that's another story. Cars with options worth something like $45k and up should probably make a decent profit, if the factory runs smoothly at high capacity. A single $60k car could bring in as much profit as five $45k cars. The more expensive, the higher the profit margins. 

Currently Tesla is building exclusively high profit margin cars that cost $50k and more. They can do that because they have a lot of pre orders so they chose which ones to build first. They are still losing money on those because production isn't running smoothly and the volume is relatively low. Once they have serviced all people that want those, they will have another round of AWD vehicles. After that, the overwhelming number of cars they will produce is low and zero margin ones. So the question is, how much longer can they keep producing high margin cars, will they be able to make profits on those before they are through with their invites and how high is the percentage of new incoming orders that want high margin cars."
Yes they do. Not directly but the average selling price (ASP) of the iPhone is reported quarterly and is a closely watched number. Upselling customers to a higher-margin premium variant is a huge deal and makes a big impact on the financial calculus of the stock.

Then that would be a teachable moment where Musk could have explained the take rate by mentioning both those who bought and those who are deferring for other models to give a holistic picture. Musk being silent on the matter in fact perpetuates whatever misleading information is out there.
I don't understand. What did you want the note to mention? How many configurations are available? Professional investors know that already.
"> They've got a gigantic backlog of orders

Seems they have a bunch of reservations, not orders.

The question was of how many of those reservations were turning to orders is relevant.

Partly it goes to product mix and ASP,  If 20% of orders are for LR and 80% people are waiting for SR, then they would model the financials differently."
"> (at one point were even un-selling it in favor of Models S+X). 

Even? Of course they want to sell S+X to those people because demand for S+X is *way* down and the margin is way higher.

>They've got a gigantic backlog of orders

They don't. They have a lot of *reservations*. It is *very* important how many of those actually buy a car."
"If almost all of that backlog is $35k or $40k cars that means Tesla is in trouble because it will almost certainly not be able to make those profitable. Plus, Tesla is just not marketing using traditional TV ads. They are still spending a significant amount in other ways to advertise."
"A gigantic backlog of orders *every one of which loses money for Tesla*

FTFY"
"Future sales of Model 3s is hugely important to the company’s growth story, and thus the value of the stock. People want to use outstanding reservation count and conversion rate to better model/project what future sales will be. This is a totally reasonable question from an investor, and it is disappointing and concerning that Musk was unwilling to answer it. There was a very famous earnings call where Jeff Skilling refused to answer an analyst who asked a basic financial reporting question and called him an asshole. Transparency is a good thing for public companies, and hostility can be used to hide bad things from the public."
"They don't need to worry about *number* of sales (yet), but they do have to worry about the value of those sales. The conversion rate is an important measure of how many reservation holders plan to order the high-margin optioned-out version of the car vs the cheaper version. "
"The analysts are trying to model the medium term future, not just the current quarter or even upcoming quarter.  "

"I answer questions for a living, and I often don't answer stupid questions.

I would consider this a stupid question, because of the idea of a ""critical path"". What determines the # of sales of a product is the lowest bandwidth part of the supply chain & demand side of things. If you're building bicycles and have 200 wheels, 100 frames, and 100 customers, you're in great shape.

But if any one of those numbers falls, sales will fall proportionally, and if any one of those rises, nothing happens.

Supply chain & manufacturing are, without a doubt the bottleneck. The demand seen here is without precedent anywhere in any industry.

There were 100k reservations sight-unseen, now there's half a million reservations. That's insane.

Now you can drive that up to 10 million reservations, and nothing material will change in their sales.

When you get to the point where one number is clearly so far away from being a constraining factor, when no effort has been put into driving that number, the appropriate answer to ""how many..."" type questions is ""a shitload"".

No data on those numbers is going to be useful/relevant within the next 12 months, as we're going to see much more information in the form of user reviews, customer feedback, word-of-mouth advertising, showroom displays, reliability tests, etc, that any number you pull out of that is A. irrelevant now and B. has no chance of being relevant in the future.

If it's not relevant now, and not relevant in the future, should I waste time answering such a question? No.

That's not to say it's a a stupid question, or a common question, it's just that for this scenario, we're in a canoe going over a waterfall in 10 minutes and this guy wants to talk about what we do about the waterfall 1,000 miles down the river.

Dude should shut up and not worry about it yet. Yeah, that waterfall 1,000 miles away is worth worrying about when we get there, but now? It's not valuable for anyone except for his own ""model"", which is bound to be wrong and useless to anyone at Tesla."
"Because no matter what he said he knows it’s a loaded question that people can spin in any direction they want. 

Let’s said it’s 20% Buy and 80% are waiting for the P model. That would be great but you’d still have headlines like “ONLY 20 PERCENT OF RESERVATION HOLDERS WANT THE CAR”

It doesn’t say anything. Especially since some of the options aren’t even there. You can’t designate if you’re simply waiting for white interior or performance model. "
Or he could have said “I don’t have that number and here’s why it’s not important...”
"> Sacconaghi's question was also quite stupid,

Sacconaghi was trying to figure out if the reduction in capex was going to reduce productive capacity.  I agree the follow up question wasn't great, but what he was trying to figure out was if Tesla is going to need to make those capex investments anyway at some point in the future (for example, if they are needed to produce enough batteries to make say 7000 cars a month).   "

But the difference is other auto maufactures more or less make the same cars with the same margins via the same process each year. Their guesses about sales and production volumes are reasonably accurate.

Is the purpose of the earnings call to allow analysts to validate their models?

If so  Telsa would be legally required to answer every question and an earnings call will last 10 hours."
"Are you really not worried that the business is willingly withholding information just because the information is negative? What if 100% of reservation holders deferred (which obviously is not the case but just a hypothetical)? 

Would you prefer Elon not mention it just because it would push down the stock price?"
"""... Elon already knows anything he says is going to be spun negatively, hence he refrained from answering this question and giving the short sellers ammunition.""

Not answering was far worse from a spin point of view.

In a notorious incident on April 17, 2001 Enron CEO Jeff Skilling called an analyst an ""asshole"" because of a question Skilling didn't like on a conference call like this one.  Enron declared bankruptcy on December 2, 2001.  Skilling is still serving his 14 year sentence in federal prison.  This is not something Musk should want to bring to people's minds as a possible analogy."
"That’s not the point he’s making, untill all options are available you can’t conclude wether delaying first production is because you want AWD or base."
"Ummm, the company is going to be profitable after 2nd quarter this year. Elon elaborated on this multiple times during the call. If people don't like his calls them they can leave TSLA."

"The problem is Tesla has always had negative cash flow from operations, which is calculated excluding all of the money put into new investments.  That is what makes them different from Amazon; if Amazon stopped making all investments they would generate a ton of free cash flow.  That has been true for years.

The other analyst has a much higher price target though, so how does that fit Elon's narrative?"
"So now only certain questions can be asked?

"In regards to people changing their minds, the investor letter indicated there were more than 450,000 reservations.  The fact that this is true after competitive vehicles have come out like the Bolt is a positive sign for Tesla I think.  This will be something to keep an eye on I think."
As a Long investor in Tesla with a large position I actually thought the questions were important. Felt like Elon was just avoiding giving answers that wouldn’t look positive. Willing to cut him slack at the moment because I have faith in him but he should have answered. Frustrating. 
They can change their price target to say 400 and recommend a buy... lol just because they said $265 st a point in the one doesn’t mean they can’t change it

"> Short sellers do have an important function in the market,

Which is?"
"I don't completely agree that short sellers are important for just fraudulent companies .. 

they are also necessary to keep in check executives who love to give aggressive guidance like Elon Musk which can make a stock outperform in the short term but hit investors when the guidance is eventually not met .. 

you need contrarians like short sellers to push the executives on the drivers behind the guidance because investors who are long are typically less willing to push the execs as they are already convinced .. 

I don't think Elon is a fraud but he is well know as someone who loves to give aggressive guidance "
"short sellers aren't just about fighting fraud, they're also perfectly reasonable to short sell a stock if they think it's over-valued, particularly if they think bad information isn't built into the stock price."
"> Short sellers actually benefit longs.

Only short sellers **who lose money** benefit longs. I specifically limited my statements to ""*successful* Tesla shorts"", i.e. those making money.

That money, at this stage of Tesla's development, are parasitic, ill gotten gains.

> For one thing they allow you to buy the stock more cheaply since they're willing to sell it to you. If they're wrong they lose money and you make money.

Again this is only true if the short loses money - which, if it happens, is karma well deserved.

> Shorts also provide liquidity in the market, if nobody sold the markets would have very poor liquidity so anybody trying to buy the stock would excessively pump up the price without shorts being willing to sell to them.

That's a fundamental misunderstanding: a fair chunk of the real liquidity is provided by *sellers*, who are, in most cases, not shorts, but investors, employees and other longs who are getting out at a certain time and price.

The ""liquidity"" that is provided by shorts is essentially just theft from those who are unlucky to sell to successful shorts when they close their positions: without the short intermediary step that long who sold at the bottom could have sold at the much higher value where the (successful) short opened the position.

Edit: here's a [simple example in another comment where I outlined where shorts make money at the expense of everyone else](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8gyk9x/elon_the_dry_questions_were_not_asked_by/dyfsvdt/) - and how the outcome would be better without shorts.

I.e. in the case of Tesla when a short is successful and is making money it's *always* at the expense of a much more productive, much more positive market participant...

I do agree that more broadly there might be market value in shorting fraudulent companies - but Tesla is not such a company.

> The stock markets would look like Bitcoin during the 2013 bubble,

No, stock markets would look like the stock markets where short positions are regulated. Those still have ups and downs, based on how short-term, mid-term and long-term investors judge the value of the stock.

(Bitcoin's meteoric rise and fall was a classical deflationary spiral of a finite mathematical commodity and virtual currency with very real intrinsic economic utility - and the inevitable bust.)
"
"> Markets are supposed to have 2 sides. A buy side and a sell side. If the buy side goes crazy (like it has for Tesla stock and many others in the past(I'm not attacking Tesla I'm trying to explain how markets work)), then it makes sense to sell short because you think someone is overpaying for the stock no matter what the underlying company is. 

In that description, which is mostly accurate but somewhat misleading I don't see you listing the benefits of successful Tesla shorts.

In the description you gave above any successful short seller of Tesla reduced the Tesla stock price, which only has negative effects:

- It is hurting Tesla employees whose stock is vesting periodically and which stock they are selling to gain income
- The lower historic return on the stock makes it more difficult for Tesla to attract top tech talent, whose compensation package typically consists of (various forms of) stock options
- Higher volatility might also squeeze longs
- Investors who need the liquidity and are selling Tesla stock while it's low lose money as well
- Any money a short makes is by buying the stock at a lower price (for simplicity let's ignore the futures/options market which has a similar role) - which roughly means that a long got less return
- In addition to all that the volatility caused by shorts makes Tesla debt financing costs more expensive: delaying R&D, delaying profitability

So since you are supposed to be an expert in this field, could you please **explicitly** list the market benefits of successful Tesla shorts? You have listed none so far.

"> That's because it doesn't really matter so much for the bottom line of Apple. They have huge profit margins for every product they sell and they don't have a multiple year pre order list they are working off. With Tesla it matters because in the car business margins on any car except for the luxury market are extremely low.

Except the models rolling off of Tesla's production lines are known and especially the 3 only has 1 configuration rolling out the door atm. And they are not at all demand constrained on that configuration. There are still hundreds of thousands of people out there who are waiting in line but didn't even get an invite yet."
"Maybe the analysts were still consulting their old notes which read that Tesla was forecasting a 1,000,000 car a year rate in 2020.  What is the prediction for production in 2020 these days?  I haven't heard.

If we're talking a million cars, maybe the conversion rate is important.

I was disappointed no one asked how the Gigafactory was going.  Does it look like the artist's renderings yet?  Last I checked, it looked considerably smaller."
"No, if Tesla did start making 10K/week beginning next year, they'd burn through their reservations really quick. If Tesla did on average 5K/week for the 2nd half the year and then did on average 10K/week beginning 1/19, by July 1st of next year that would be almost 400K cars. If you're planning on making 400K cars in the timespan of a year, the take number is really quite important to establish that there's demand for that production capacity."
"That's a fair point. I suspect some of Elon's concern (and what he has also alluded to) is that there would be a media circus surrounding a reasonable reservation->order conversion rate (i.e. explainable by people sitting out for yet unavailable configurations) due to lack of public understanding of the circumstances. Few journalists will hold the reader's hand through explaining that LR is being built first and what comes next.. and the oversimplified and/or sensationalized headline (i.e. ""Only 20% of Model 3 reservations are becoming orders"" -- or something to that affect, with the obvious misinterpretation to go along with that) will be what sticks.. and a storm will ensue. In all PR, politics, etc. I wish that it were as simple as letting the facts go out and be explained -- I'd be a little curious too -- but it's a mess out there."
"About a month ago I had a crazy exchange with someone who absolutely could not understand that *reservations ≠ orders*. They kept insisting that they have 15-20 billion in guaranteed future revenue because they have 450,000 orders. But they don't. They have 450,000 reservations. 50% could still not buy even the base model."
Does that mean that they are actually advertising the 3 in USA? I thought they didn't advertise it at all. 
"Those are arguments that can be made to others to try to convince them, but I have a hard time believing that people paying attention would actually be swayed."

"I think the trouble is that sometimes, going by the book as if everything is equal is actually stupid. It becomes stupid to go through the motions. I see this in my job all the time when dealing with peers and management -- there are times where those thinking from their experience have to make the decisions and ask for some trust that we're handling/considering more than can be carefully communicated + laid out and addressed.. and so a strong macro case/strategy gets made rather than a detailed line-item case (and at that point, the adage about being able to lead a horse to water but not being able to make it drink is applicable -- they need to think it through, or forget them). The near-future is going to change things. Improved production will change things, availability of more configurations will change things, availability of the Model Y will bring more families into buying cars -- and rather than take Elon's word on the future (forward-looking statements get a little tricky with public companies), people need to honestly use their brains on their own. There are countless orders ready to come in beyond those 500,000 reservations. I'll be one, along with the Model Y."
"> The conversion rate is an important measure of how many reservation holders plan to order the high-margin optioned-out version of the car vs the cheaper version

"[Actually...](http://i.imgur.com/DpQ9YJl.png)

In any event, that's literally just your opinion. There's no facts or any metric available to support that. Which leads me to my next point:

*That's exactly the reason why analysts ask questions like ""how many people are configuring their pre-order.""*

Because there isn't any other way to know. 

And if you honestly think that question, answer and other data isn't available in the packet of analytics I am sure Musk and Co. receive on a monthly, if not weekly basis, you're sorely mistaken.

If those numbers were good, Elon wouldn't/shouldn't have a problem answering that question.

The simple fact is the answer is probably zero, or close to it. What people do is put a thousand dollars down in the hopes (I think vainly) that they will be able to secure a Tesla delivery sometime in the next few years (laughable considering poor production numbers). This is why no one is customizing it, because it's basically the thousand dollar Tesla lotto. They don't want to commit to something they aren't sure of receiving in the first place. Which is a poor business model. 

This is also what allows Musk and Co. to sell the ones they are able to produce at something like a $23,000 loss per unit. They are basically getting interest free business capital from the hypeheads $1000 at a time that fills that gap, in the hopes that maybe 5-10 years down the line (lol) the lines will be come *actually profitable* enough to sustain production and fulfill the orders. As of right now, if Tesla just closed up shop, it would owe *a lot of people, a lot of money*.

It's like Tesla is robbing Peter's pre orders to build Paul's Tesla, while only having the *intention* to give Peter his preorder back (sans interest) down the line when they can't produce enough Tesla.

Give Elon Musk $1000 in 2015 dollars for a deposit, receive $950 in 2018 dollars back when they, or you, cancel the pre-order. (Adjusted for inflation, naturally)

What a shitty fucking deal.

One day, sooner rather than later, Tesla will fold like a bad poker player under pressure. They aren't making money. They haven't been able to make money, ever. They aren't meeting production goals, nor have they ever been able to come close to their production goals. They money they are taking in on pre-orders outweighs their unit profitability by a factor of 20 to 1. That means, to just break even, they need 20 more pre-orders for each car they produce. Here's another protip: That ratio hasn't been going down over the life of the company. Their loss per unit has actually *steadily increased* over time. Moreover, their CEO is split into nineteen different directions with all of his other projects and companies.

The writing is on the wall. 

Elon knows this, and that explains this attitude.

Also, important note: There wasn't a question asked on this call with Musk, *that hasn't been asked and answered on other calls, from other people, before.*"
"Then Elon could have said that instead of running from the question.
"
"> But half the people that deferred may actually want to spend more and get awd/performance.

Sure, and maybe Santa is real.  But the more obvious answer would be that, as with every other car that has ever been produced, more people are going to opt for the cheaper variants.  "
"\>You don't know which way they want to go

No but having more information about what's going on with reservations would have helped."
Doesn't Tesla allow you to select what you are waiting for?
"I think it's relevant because the stock price is based off of the number of reservation holders. If a lot of reservation holders are canceling their orders, then the stock price is inflated relative to where it should be."
This isn’t about headlines or spin. This is about analysts getting data for their valuation models so they can value the stock. That is their job.
"> no matter what he said he knows it’s a loaded question that people can spin in any direction they want.

This might be what is happening in Musks's head but that still doesn't forgive his willingness to change the question in order to justify his reason for not answering the question. 

I just wish Musk would answer the question, whether it's spun negatively or not. People will always spin news in a negative light, that's what get's clicks. Ignoring the question and ultimately changing the question to better justify passive ignorance is worse for an image than answering a question honestly and having it spun negatively. 

I agree with you that no matter how he answers the question, it's going to be spun negatively but that doesn't justify his act of willful ignorance. "
If 80% of the reservations are waiting for another model that wont be available until a later date that would and should have an impact on the companies value. Even if total reservations remained the same the fact that people would be waiting has an impact. Do you not get this?

Well I do, and they always ask questions about the sales mix.

> But the difference is other auto maufactures more or less make the same cars with the same margins via the same process each year. Their guesses about sales and production volumes are reasonably accurate.

Generally yes, it is easier to make estimates around existing models.  But that doesn't mean that information is not provided when new models are introduced.  

> Is the purpose of the earnings call to allow analysts to validate their models?

Not so much validate as allow them to update to come up with new price targets.  

> If so Telsa would be legally required to answer every question and an earnings call will last 10 hours.

No, just because the point of the call is to provide data to investors doesn't mean there is a legal requirement to answer every question they have.  Investors are not regulators.  If Tesla wants to tell them to go jump off a cliff they can do that.  But a company like Tesla that (i) probably needs a lot of investor money to finance future product lines and (ii) absolutely requires a lot of investor money to refinance the debt they have coming due in the next 12 months, should not be pissing off their investor base.  "
"I would be worried if I could not reconcile it with real world data. VIN tracking, this sub, and Teslike's spreadsheet give us a really clear picture. If they started reporting positive earnings or unaccounted for revenue, then I would start to panic. People act like Elon is committing fraud, but if you're committing fraud why would you give people such terrible financials?

Overall, I am ambivalent either way about him mentioning it, because I like the negative headlines, that's the only way I can buy the stock at a good price :) The concerted FUD blitz around the end of March created the best buying opportunity in nearly a year and a half (down to 250)."
"The information isn't negative it can be misrepresented as negative that is the difference.

Tesla is on the record with the official version of the information, thier forward projections."
"I agree. So why not say ""Right now the conversion rate is around X%, which is low because we found that X% are waiting for AWD, standard battery etc. When accounting for these factors, our take rate is actually a very healthy X%"". Or even better, ""Like with the S & X, we don't plan to publish the order conversion rate since we find the number can be misleading as many reservation holders are waiting for options not yet available.""

These seem like responses no one would talk much about, unlike Elon deciding to make negative headlines by insulting analysts and cutting people off."
"Not with 100% accuracy, but you can certainly make pretty accurate assumptions about the options people want.  At any rate, Tesla is clearly hiding the ball on the this because the number looks bad for them."

"> Ummm, the company is going to be profitable after 2nd quarter this year. 

According to who?  Not the company.  According to them:

> Thus, provided that we hit the 5,000 unit milestone in our projected timeframe and execute to the rest of our plan, we will at least be profitable in Q3 and Q4 excluding non-cash stock based compensation

So first, they have to hit their production targets on the timeframe they have set out (which they have never done in the history of the company).  And have everything else go according to plan, which we conveniently have no way of actually verifying. If they do that they will be profitable, but only if you don't count a gigantic expense of hundreds of millions of dollars they have.

TBD.  Hasn't gone bust yet.
You'd know you were wrong already if you bothered to look up whether Tesla had ever turned a profit instead of just repeating a lie you heard somewhere.
Are you sure about that? I think they were profitable briefly after the S and X launches.
Investors literally just offered the guy billions  of dollars to convince him *not* to do that.  
Thank you for this!
"> He also couldn't answer the question: How many customers have configured their Model 3?

We already have a pretty good idea of that, even without his comments.

> The rest is up in the air whether they will wait for their spot or not.

People have been saying this for at least the last year.  It has yet to produce a meaningful effect on the reservation totals.  They've certainly had a not insignificant number of cancellations, but they're entirely muted by the continuing pace of new reservations, despite the backlog.  Presumably making the wait time shorter will draw people in who were only casually considering the 3.
"
"> The rest is up in the air whether they will wait for their spot or not.

lol I don't know about you, but I typically don't leave $1000 lying around for a deposit on something that I don't intend to buy.  Anyone that is not planning on eventually buying some variant of the car would have cancelled already."
The question was about the percentage of people who have been given the opportunity to configure their car but have deferred until different options are available.  They do have that information but are refusing to provide it.
"> The other analyst has a much higher price target though, so how does that fit Elon's narrative?

If you read the rest of his comments, he stated that his issue with the other analyst was that he was asking about demand when a) they've done no advertising b) they have up to two years of backlog remaining c) the *exact* same concerns were raised repeatedly for the both the S & X.  Neither ended up being true, and the 3 has more potential appeal than either of those vehicles.  So the question kind of ignored reality.

Don't get me wrong, I'm already sick of the victory lap and pats on the back the retail investor questions got - they weren't great questions because they didn't produce new information, but he's definitely getting his 15 minutes of fame for it.  He really lucked out by being the follow up to that debacle.  

Despite the entertainment value, I was disappointed by nearly all of the questions, from both the institutional investors and the one asking on behalf of retail investors.  None of these guys ask questions that haven't been asked before numerous times, much less ones that produce actual insight into the company.  For all the hubub about crowdsourcing, those questions were kind of predictable.  They were fixated on high level business ideas, not actual current business.  And then, on the other side, you had people fixated on the current margins, volume, etc and ignoring the context of those numbers - all pretty short term data points.  I feel like they all missed the forest from the trees.  

What actually matters is the medium-term: 12-18 months.  In that regard, very few questions or answers touched on the factors that impact that time frame.

"> I do agree that more broadly there might be market value in shorting fraudulent companies - but Tesla is not such a company.

What useful shorters do is go short in what they *think* is a fraudulent or otherwise doomed company and then do their damndest to show that this company actually *is* what they think it is. They will investigate every possible aspect of the company's business and agressively bring to light anything they think looks fishy - and they will put constant pressure on the company because a company that's already actually creaking at the seams may crack under that extra pressure.

This is happening to Tesla, and it may well be happening because there are shorters out there who genuinely think that Tesla is fraudulent or too weak to survive. That they are probably wrong is a different matter, people are sometimes wrong and we just have to accept that.

They are doing what we need them to do, however inconvenient it may be for Tesla at the moment. We can't expect them to somehow magically always be right and so if we're going to have the shorting mechanism around as a market-regulating tool at all then this is what we get.

Shorters who are wrong will get their just reward in the end."

"I hear you.  But this was an opportunity to “sell” the results and set the narrative.  “Over 30% decided to buy immediately while others are waiting for the more expensive AWD or the value priced SR.  Remarkably we had less than 10% decide not to buy which is overshadowed by the 10% increase in reservations.”
(Numbers made up)

Yup, the media can sound bite that, but he has enough fans in the media that they would say great things. 

Instead all they got was 14 seconds and let’s go to YouTube.  Then blame the shorts. "
"Tesla likes to say they don't use 'traditional' means of advertising, meaning something like TV ads or billboards. But these days a lot of what you do is for example giving content creators/influencers on blogs, youtube etc presents or money if they say nice things about your company. Or when people buy products via special links on those content creator's websites/channels. Tesla definitely does that. Astroturfing is a more nefarious method but that would be another thing that more and more companies \(and governments\) are engaged in. It's hard to tell if Tesla is doing that since Tesla attracts a lot of a certain type of fans that act like astroturfers all on their own \(mass up/downvotes in forum comment sections, using bots and stuff\). Trading favorable coverage in media outlets for favors like access or exclusive stories is another dishonest practice that companies and governments use. Publicity stunts and seemingly amateur videos that are designed by marketing studios to go viral \(usually helped by an extra push by astroturfers\). Making events for product releases and car shows is also part of advertising. That's definitely something Tesla is spending a decent chunk of money on. Etc.

What all those have in common is that they are generally not only more effective than billboards and TV ads, they are also much cheaper. I think someone calculated Tesla spends like $65m last year on those non traditional forms of advertising. It's a lot less than most companies, but it's not nothing."
"Indeed, not politics; cold hard cash which doesn’t lie. Your last comment is probably intentionally confusing but, no matter, it is entirely useless.

The point is that scaling up production promises to increase the cash burn further especially given that the entire production process needs reworking (again) which implies economies of scale won’t be realized in the short term. Elon’s suggestion that there won’t be any need for another capital infusion in light of this shows he’s either incompetent or flat out lying; I’m betting a little of column A and a little of column B."
"It doesn't give you a perfect measure of it, no, but it gives you something to go on. If I had to place my bets, I'd wager that most people that are deferring, after putting down a reservation for what was understood as ""the $35,000 Tesla"", are deferring because they are waiting for the $35,000 version of this car (or something closer to it). 

I'm sure some people are waiting so they can spend more, or to spend a similar amount for different options, but I'd bet that most deferred reservations end up becoming configurations that are under the current $49,000 minimum price for a Model 3. 

I'm not an investor myself but if I were, I'd take a low conversion rate as a sign that most Model 3s sold will be sold at lower profit margins than the first production model."
"Close to zero? Shitty fucking deal? Do you have a reservation? Or even a clue? What a victimless crime. If anyone in line regretted it, they could always get their money back. Instead, they are clamoring for the car.

2nd this is still early adapters (buying the Model 3), so they are not normal (avg.) people.

If you look at the threads on reddit, more people bitch about not having AWD, performance, white interior, etc... than they bitch about price. Sure people on reddit are not normal people... the fact is we just don't know, my feeling is its going to be around 50/50 base (but still with autopilot and paint) vs. 55k +

"
No but that would provide the data to answer the question. They should and base production of that.
"Stock price is based on expected income, for all companies. If the constraint is production, then number of customers has no impact on revenue.

That will be the case for this quarter, and next quarter, and the quarter after, and the quarter after.

As this is a quarterly earnings call, and this number isn't relevant for at least another 4 quarters, I'd say this question can safely be ignored.

Granted this is a matter of opinion/expectations, but I'd say were good to skip over this topic and move on."
"> because the stock price is based off of the number of reservation holders.

Not really; it's based off their ability to build the cars to satisfy the demand that's already there.

When you look at all of the other car companies that are coming out with electric vehicles now, Jaguar and Porsche for example, it's them trying to get into the space that Tesla opened.

The demand is there; it's their ability to fill the demand that everyone is holding their breath about.

That, and getting the other product lines up, like the Y, Truck, and the Semi (along with the S / X refresh).

Anyone who seriously is saying to themselves, ""People are going to cancel all of their orders,"" has misread the market."
they said 400k+ reservations...
"These guys don't really understand how analysts model. Like yes if 80% of the reservations are waiting for another option that is going to take another 2 years (just making up timeline) to put out then that would have an impact on the value of the company (even if total reservations stayed the same).

Trying to follow the logic in this thread of users pretending they know how companies are valued is painful."

The company said they will only be profitable in Q3 (well not really ""profitable"", actually ""profitable if you don't count a few hundred million of equity compensation"") if they meet their production targets on schedule (obviously this will happen as the company has never missed a production target) and if everything else in their business plan goes as expected.

"> Sorry, I updated my answer to give a more complete response and to help understand my point. Short sellers are important, particularly for fraudulent companies.

That's true in general, but note that I intentionally qualified my claims to apply to those shorting *Tesla*: while 10 years ago maybe someone could have had doubts about whether Tesla can bring a product to the market - but today it's pretty clear that Tesla is obviously not a fraudulent company ...

So I maintain my original observation: any money that a successful TSLA short makes is at the expense of one of these (positive) entities:

- real investors and longs
- employees of Tesla
- customers of Tesla

Successful TSLA shorts are essentially involved in legalized theft and market abuse.
"
"> > Which is?
>
> See if you're asking these types of questions.  You don't know what you'e doing.

I've seen many variants of rationalizations that short sellers delude themselves with to cope with their fundamentally parasitic nature (which is a tough thing to be unless you are an amoral sociopath), so I inquired about which specific argument this one is - I'm not a mind reader.

There's also the off chance that some genuinely new argument is raised that I have not considered yet - in which case I'll change my opinion.

So let me ask again: which ""important market function"" do successful shorts of TSLA stock have?

My claim is that there's no advantage, and all you have to do to disprove my argument is to list at least one genuinely positive market function of successful Tesla shorts.

"No comment for or against on the rest (although my casual impression is that scrupulous short selling may have some positive roles in market), but FYI WRT your assertion:

> it is possible to be short in abusive ways, such as spreading misinformation or in some times and places shorting as a stock falls to manipulate it. That has at times been legal and not in the US. *It’s not a factor either way for a large stock like Tesla* [emph. mine]

I wouldn't be so sure of that...  Stocks like RIM peaked at $80B USD cap '08 were argued as manipulatable with strategies described by ex. hedge fund manager Jim Cramer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI) with methods that despite illegality in some cases, were not effectively enforced by SEC.

In some ways it's related to 'short & distort' (https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp bearish opposite of bullish 'pump & dump') by forming and hyping up a negative perspectives (opt. including on social media) and leaving out positive context (like a plausible deniability form of short & distort.)  For example, players may emphasize a spurious YoY or QoQ (see example table: https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/89dkwu/tesla_q1_2018_vehicle_production_and_deliveries/dwqnb5w/?context=1) drop in volume as ominous weakness effectively creating momentary uncertainty and stock price dip to benefit their short position (while they're incentivized and thus intentionally IMO) leaving out important context.

Or like Ackman in Herbalife (https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/04/bill-ackman-dan-loeb-herbalife) , the player finds a negative angle and asserts a full-court press selling their thesis while simultaneously shorting the target company. 

Because Tesla is leveraged, major negative momentum can have a amplifying detrimental feedback effect on equity raises and employee retention, so despite it having a significant market cap, it is not necessarily invulnerable to negative repercussions short/bear distortion and has to play defense and/or counter-offense against (neither of which is surprising for a volatile public company esp. one with proclaimed and echoed bullish momentum and/or aspirations which would unsurprisingly also attract bearish resistance esp. since bullish thesis has variable time window and ambiguous certainty; it gives lots of room/flexibility for 'bear' plays (e.g. FUD) .)"
"> shorting is percectly legal and perfectly moral 

Many forms of shorting are not legal at all in many advanced markets - for hundreds of years it wasn't legal to short stocks in most markets - yet markets worked reasonably well and rewarded investors while punishing dud concepts. The very first attempt to short a stock in history resulted in a (partial) ban on short selling in the Netherlands.

In the U.S. there's [rampant naked shorting](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/09/naked-short-selling.asp), mostly in the options market - which is illegal in many other markets.

The morality of shorting depends - as with any other economic transaction - on the exact circumstances of the contract:

- Shorting of fraudulent companies is mostly moral as it transfers ill gotten gains away from fraudsters and their co-conspirators. It also protects victims by limiting the run-up price of pump & dump schemes - the situation you mention as well in your comment.
- Shorting is immoral when it is hurting a clearly creative, forward looking, R&D centric company like Tesla: the increased volatility of shorting creates numerous externalities such as increased financing costs, worse employee retention, lower employee income, etc. etc. - beyond harming those investors who were right about Tesla. Aggravating factors are if the shorting is done while also spreading and/or amplifying negative messages to the public in parallel to shorting a stock, to help drive down the price.
- Shorting is amoral where it's not clear whether a company is fraud or not.

In the case of Tesla shorts: they might be successful, but let's be honest, they are essentially the financial market analogues of successful parasites in nature: **cuckoos, eye worms, intestine worms, ticks, leeches**.

This is not a happy thought - so shorts who aren't total sociopaths make up rationalizations like 'providing liquidity' or 'lowering prices for longs', none of which stands up to scrutiny if you analyze the market at the transaction level: every single dollar a successful short makes against an otherwise successful company can only be at the expense of a long - this is the nature of zero-sum financial markets.
"
Way to simply insult and not answer the question.
"> What you're doing is deflecting and I don't care.

What are you talking about? I have provided a very specific, broad list of harmful effects that successful shorts of Tesla cause in the market. You can see the list above and in other replies I gave in this thread.

In response you haven't listed a **single** benefit that successful shorts of Tesla provide to the market. Successful shorts don't provide real liquidity, they don't reward investors - all they do is to take money away from one of the following entities:

- long-term, mid-term longs/investors who were *right* about going long
- Tesla employees whose compensation includes stock
- Tesla itself: shorts cause higher operational costs through reduced stock financing and increased bond yields; shorts make it harder for Tesla to attract much needed tech talent; shorts reduce the income of Tesla employees and thus hurt morale and employee retention; volatility by shorts can indirectly increase product price as well and thus can indirectly hurt customers as well, etc.

These are very specific types harm caused by parasitic shorts, and all of this harm is hurting the company. All you'd need to do to prove me wrong is to list a **single** benefit that successful shorts provides to the market as a whole but it's only been crickets so far ...

This is why Elon Musk finds Tesla shorts disgusting scum, and he is right about that."

"Yeah. I even think he could have done a better job of blowing off the question (and describing the reason), if arming opposition with specific numbers to use in a narrative was something he didn't want to do. It certainly wasn't handled in the greatest way. On the other hand, I'm Tesla long and someone who's probably supposed to care when this sort of thing happens.. and I actually don't. It's pretty obvious that his odd outlook on these things is partly where the potentially large upside originates, and awkward instances like this are going to be part of the whole package (keeping this outlook on things reduces my stress across all aspects of life). If Tesla needs to secure capital from large investors, I'd prefer that a certain subset of the relevant figures are explained/disclosed to them privately at least as far as is allowed by trade regulations. Seeing confusion/misinformation in the media is painful."

After Musk used it for his own purposes, short interest, and worth less on account of inflation. I personally am not in the business of giving people interest free business capital.

> I’m driving a Model 3. Best. Car. Ever.

For now. We will see in 5 years or even 10. And again, I never disputed the quality of their product. Just their ability to produce enough of it and do that at a profit is a whole different story.

">Stock price is based on expected income, for all companies. If the constraint is production, then number of customers has no impact on revenue.

Your completely wrong if you think that analysts/ wall street haven't priced out future income from 450,000 reservations into the current stock price

It doesn't matter whether the bottleneck right now is production. If there is a tempering of demand by current reservation holders or future buyers, that decreases the future income that Tesla will earn"
"> Stock price is based on expected income, for all companies. If the constraint is production, then number of customers has no impact on revenue.

This comment alone shows that you don't know what you're talking about. There is not one driver for all companies/sectors that drives stock price (ie. in oil & gas cash flow is the key metric off of which stock price is driven, net income is actually a useless figure). Even amongst countries different metrics are used (in Europe for O&G they look to Income whereas in North America CF is key)."

The clickbait question was essentially, ""Are people not cancelling their reservations but waiting for their preferred variant of the car to become available?""  That's a meaningless question.

I should get my invite next month and will not buy the LR PUP for two reasons. #1 I wilk defer due to existing lease. #2 I want the AWD LR PUP with white seats...which means I am waiting for what should be an even higher margin variant. It was a question that had no good answer because Tesla has no idea why some folks will defer and the have gotten through less than 10% of invites."
"Perhaps.  We don't need Elon to discuss this to get real insight into it, though.  And,for what its worth, I think he realized that he was just as boneheaded for handling it the way he did - he admitted this morning that he handed it poorly, and that he should have taken on the question and pressed them with actual data instead of getting frustrated with it, which made him look just as bad.  The net result was that people saw what they wanted to see, from both perspectives.  

All of the early orders are higher margin because of the restrictions on early production.  When that begins to wane (presumably late this year), they'll roll out AWD, white interior and performance variants, which will continue their ability to extract a premium.  If we want to question the % of folks who are willing to wait for those, we do get a small sample size from the user-reported reservation data.  Despite it's obvious limitations, it provides an idea of the hold/order ratio.

I do think this question is more germane to the longer term, especially with the Y being in the pipeline.  I'd say the Y is cutting into reservation conversion almost as much right now as people waiting for the base model with zero options.  Of course, by that time, if they've scaled properly, they should realize some breakeven or increasing margin on the base model based on scale, alone.  If they're doing it right, anyway.

To that end, I think a question asking about scaling and whether their cost structure was realizing the savings they expected (or whether it would as this year rolls into next) would have been something that *should* have been asked, instead of what we got."

Also, if Tesla doesn't want to attract shorts, they need to improve their financials and/or do a better job of presenting their path to sustained profitability."
"> Having said that, possible interpretation of Elon's viewpoint is that they can't even fullfill the 450,000 reservations fast enough, which makes rate of conversion sort of pointless, unless you can drum up news that they are only converting 50% of reservations, which could be seen as failure and create a sell off.

Here is the problem.  Lets say only 5% are converting their reservations to orders when currently given the opportunity (I know the number is probably way higher than that, this is just an example).  That would mean that pretty soon all reservation holders will have been given the option of buying the $55k version of the car currently available.  

At that point Tesla would need to start making other versions of the car available.  They will of course start with the next highest margin versions (AWD, etc.).  But if the conversion rate for those is also only 5%, it will only take a few months of production at 10,000 cars per month to get through all of the people that want those versions.  

So pretty quickly Tesla will need to start making the $44k versions of the car, and the $40k versions of the car.  And as they do that their profit margins will get lower and lower, since the margins on the cheaper versions are lower.  The sooner that starts happening the worse it is for Tesla, and the timing of that is really dependent on the conversion rate.

FYI - it is highly unlikely the conversion rate is anywhere close to 50%.  People who have spent time trying to put estimates together have it significantly lower than that, which makes sense given the very limited options currently available.  The press might make a big deal out of the number, but the only thing that would really matter for the stock price is how that figure impacts investor models for future margins."

No way any CEO of any company answers that question. There is literally no upside.

But does it make a difference whether Tesla is sold out of 1 year of production or sold out of 18 months of production? Once the line starts to get shorter, they can use any of the untouched levers to try to spark demand.

Your headlights aren't useful because they show you the destination when you start your trip, they show you just enough of the road to keep you going. That's really all the demand you need, enough to keep your production lines full of reserved vehicles. You never actually need a demand backlog.

This question is a question about the waterfall 1,000 miles downriver. It's not what should be focused on now, and there's so many changes that will happen before then that that is not worth thinking about, at all.

The only valuable answer to the ""how much demand is there"" question is:

""Enough.""

Any further speculation provides zero value right now to anyone at Tesla, whether it's in the form of attracting investors or not.

"I think the reservation number is partially a stupid metric because it acts as a huge barrier to the typical new car buyer from considering a Model 3. I don't think the average new car buyer plans out their next car purchase over a year in advance. 

Obviously there are limits to the size of the $50k car crowd, but I think Model 3 and Y will sell as many as Tesla can make for a long time. It will be interesting to see at what point they transition the reservation list to an order backlog. "

That's literally why people buy companies, to reap the expected future profits/cashflow/income however you want to argue that semantically. That's how companies are valued, that's the only reason for companies to have any value.

It's a generalization that holds true and there are differences in how expectations are formed, and cashflow always needs to be considered, as well as market expectations, uncertainty around exchange rates or political situations all have an effect, but what it all boils down to is that a company is valued at it's risk-adjusted (and discounted) expected future earnings."

So why have they had negative free cash flow every year of their existence even if you strip all of their investment activities?

Doubt it.  Even the company has written off Q2 as a loss.  And in Q3 they said they would only have a ""profit"" (which doesn't include any equity compensation costs for some reason) if (i) they stick to their production target and timeline and (ii) they otherwise do not deviate at all from their business plan.  Sounds like they are hedging their bets a lot to me.

Agreed, if they stop growing their revenue people will see much more clearly how unprofitable they are.  See your first statement.

Sure no problem.  They'll easily be more than 3x bigger than the largest OEM on the planet.

Amazon has had positive free cash flow for over a decade.  They invest actual profits to expand their business.  Tesla borrows money from the capital markets to make investments.  You can only do that for so long before the capital markets shut you out.  That is why the huge drop in the price of Tesla's bonds is so concerning.

Again, the negative free cash flow from operations after the Model X was in production seems to indicate that is not the case.  "

"> If you want to get long TSLA, the shorts create buying opportunities for you :)

That's a common misconception and it's not actually true.

Successful shorts of TSLA only create a ""buy"" opportunity at the expense of taking money from a long who later on sells at a lower price.

That ""buy"" opportunity was *taken away* from the later seller.

Here's a quick example:

- We have three market participants: ""Long-A"", ""Long-B"" and ""Short""

Here's a typical scenario where ""Short"" makes money (let's ignore transaction costs for a moment, they are comparatively small in this example):

- many years ago ""Long-A"" bought a single share of TSLA at $100
- yesterday, at a market price of $350, ""Short"" opens 1 share worth of short position in TSLA, by selling a single share
- ""Long-B"" thinks Tesla has future and enters the market, buying a single TLSA share at $350, from ""Short""
- since yesterday many shorts did the same in large volumes, and the price of TSLA drops to $300.
- ""Long-A"", long term investor, needs liquidity and sells a single TSLA for $300
- ""Short"", seeing the drop at an end, buys this share and closes the short position. He makes $50 of profit.
- In a year the fundamental value of TSLA raises to $400 and the stock price matches that value, and both Long-A and Long-B sell their stock for $400.

Now let's do the accounting of who made how much money and at whose expense:

- ""Short"" makes $50
- ""Long-A"" makes $200
- ""Long-B"" makes $50

If we take the 'Short' out of this scenario, and assuming that the other shorts did not depress the price back to $300 in concert, this is how the accounting would look like:

- yesterday ""Long-B"" puts up his buy limit order at $350, with no shorts providing liquidity
- today (with no volatility) ""Long-A"" sells at $350 to ""Long-B""
- in a year ""Long-B"" sells at $400

The money they make is:

- Long-A makes $250
- Long-B makes $50

Note that it's still a zero-sum game: the total amount of money made is still $300 - but the distribution is different.

In the first scenario ""Short"" basically took $50 from ""Long-A"", the long term Tesla investor who should have been rewarded.

Note that *technically* the successful short indeed created liquidity for ""Long-A"" and ""Long-B"" - but as the second scenario demonstrates they could have transacted with each other as well without that fake liquidity, with a much better outcome!

Now this all is an arguably very much simplified scenario, but it demonstrates how all other things equal the activity of shorts is a zero-sum game that takes money away from investors/longs and causes (significant!) collateral damage to Tesla itself in form of higher interest; worse employee retention; worse effective employee salaries; lower quality work force, etc. etc.

**TLDR: This is why Elon Musk thinks that Tesla shorts are disgusting, parasitic scum, and he is right about that.**"
If they're wrong then explain why.
">  A short is just a different kind of investment. Sure, a successful short on Tesla isn't good for Tesla or its investors. But that's okay! It benefits the investors who made the short.

To use an analogy from biology short positions are simply parasites in the body of the host: without Tesla constantly creating value and increasing the value of the stock (so that it can be shorted again...) shorts wouldn't be able to make a continuous income. Every dollar that a short makes is at the expense of a long/investor - as my simplified examples outline it elsewhere in this thread.

Longs on the other hand fundamentally share success (and failure) with Tesla - and as such they actively help the company and the market in general: they are not a parasitic concept but a cooperative, symbiotic entity.

Note that the ease of electronic shorting is a relatively new concept in most markets - for literally hundreds of years stock markets were able to function without any significant shorting capability: the balance of bulls and bears can set prices just as much and can drive investment and the finding of  a fair price just as well.

Most arguments you'll see here in favor of shorts are basically just rationalizations which don't stand up against scrutiny and analysis - it's the result of people feeling uncomfortable about being parasitic entities.

""A short creates buying opportunities!"" is much easier to rationalize, even though it's a lie: any buying opportunity a short creates was at the expense of an earlier long, and is at the expense of transferring income from long-term investors to short-term investors.

And yes, certain parasites can be very successful: **cuckoos, eye worms, intestine worms, ticks, leeches**, etc. - but this ""profit"" is at the expense of causing damage to the host organism."

"> Do you really think that historic losses divided by production units = what they will lose on each car in the future?

No. I know that each unit sold right now is at a 23,000 dollar loss. That's not historic. That's current and ongoing. Furthermore, that number only continues to grow, not shrink, *historically speaking.*

> If so

It's not.

> never invest in a growing business.

Don't invest in a business that's selling it's product at a loss and can't ever meet production goals. You're sorely mistaken about what ""growing"" means.

Just because it's a nice car and you own one means that they have a good business model. That's a comical notion.

> Come back and explain to me how they are making money later this year.

They won't be. Also, *historically speaking* they have never met a production goal or been profitable, despite every quarter of every year Musk saying ""It's going to happen by the end of the year!"" - Spoiler alert: It won't.

> I’m sure it will seem like magic to you.

That's about what it will take to turn around a 43% loss per unit in 9 months. A magic fucking wand."
At least I am not arguing on two separate threads like you think it's two different people.
"Cash flow does not equal income, it uses income as a starting point but normalizes back to cash flow. Additionally analysts don't just look at cash flow, they usually normalize it to ignore one time items (big gain on sale of assets, fx fluctuations etc.) I'm not sure what you are trying to prove with your link. You said in your first post that stock price is based on expected income, discounted cash flow is not income, income includes alot of non-cash items (ie. unrealized hedging gains, depreciation, future income taxes, impairment, stock based comp. etc.) which are ignored when doing a DCF model.

Which is a reason why most companies will press release their cash flow and not their income (as cash flow is viewed as more important to analysts)."
"There is a big difference between paying a small refundable reservation fee and actually paying 35-60k$ + taxes.  
Don't get me wrong I hope that every single one off these reservations translates to a car but I highly doubt it.  

And if you're constantly shouting this reservation number you really shouldn't be surprised or annoyed if someone asks how the conversion rate is. "
"I won’t convince you of this, but you are wrong. These guys are analysts for major financial advisors, not for investment companies. They have clients with all sorts of positions, and their financial incentive is to be seen as unbiased and accurate.

There have certainly been instances where analysts have skewed their recommendations for some ulterior motive (usually to make a client happy or get new business), that is illegal and monitored by the SEC and NYSE, and certainly no one doing so would make loud public statements to draw attention to themselves. You might be thinking of short-sellers who talk down a stock to improve their position; that happens, but this isn’t that. In other words, there are lots of bad people doing bad things in the stock market, but equity analysts asking relevant questions at a quarterly earnings conference is not remotely suspicious.

"> Likely not the case, as the reservation list is dynamic, with cancellations and new reservations every day.

This is true, but if only 5% of people buying the car want the $55k version out now, and only 5% want the AWD version, even if 25k new people want to buy a car each month (so a 300,000 per year demand, which would make the car like a top 3 sedan in the US), they would get through that additional demand in like 4 days.  The other 26 days of each month would be spent on the lower cost (and lower margin) versions.  Again, this is just an example and I'm sure those numbers are off.  But the point is that while the deferral rate is not a perfect indicator of future average selling prices, it is best indication we can currently get.  And the future ASP on the Model 3 is vitally important to the long term prospects of the company.

Great product. Strong demand. Good direct cost position. They’ll be fine. 
"So stepping away from semantics and getting back to the point, is there a reason a an 18 month wait is different than a 12 month wait for the Model 3?

The answer to the question about ""how much demand is there"" is very clearly ""enough"".

Since the length of the line being 12 months vs 18 months makes zero difference on cashflow/income/calorie intake/your horoscope, it's an irrelevant question.

Production matters at this point, we are very far away from demand becoming a constraint. Let's not worry about the waterfall 1,000 miles away (are we really still diving into tangents on semantics when this was solved 15 comments ago?).

Demand is not a constraint, and will not be for the next few quarters, so there's no need to discuss it in this quarterly earnings call.

Let's settle that question and be done with it."
"Another way to look at this if you hypothetically presume that the reservations do not exist (suppose that they will all cancel) is that Tesla is currently selling every car it can produce.

My question is do you think Tesla will begin having difficulties selling cars?  If so how soon will that happen?"
"You can make your own models if Elon/Tesla released enough information. It's always better to make your own model than care about what someone else is saying. I don't care that Tony whatever could update his model with that information. I would want to be able to read what Elon has to say is the actual data, see how Tony integrates it in his model, and if that makes sense, update my own model with that methodology."
"I'm already up 7 figures on $TSLA and paid the same for stock as I did my car.  When you say stuff like ""you guys"" you're only self-identifying yourself as an outsider, it's better than ""you people"" but try to work on that.

If you want to see ""what lies"" look up that account's post history.  It's a new account that has spend its entire history attacking Tesla and spreading lies with a single purpose, so it won't take long for you to find  your answers, there's no long history or diverse post history to sort through at all."
Thanks for the concern.
"I did not read the quarterly reports but the annual ones. It makes little difference that they were profitable at any one point if they went under everywhere else. I think this is an obvious truth, and a loss of 3bn+ in three years is a bit more than falsehood and lies, but maybe it's just me. I never enter the discussion whether tesla cars are better or worse than any other car because I do not know about it, but certainly most tesla fans are part of a massively brainwashed cult"
"> They haven't, if you strip the investment they would have been very profitable. 

Just look at the cash flow statement in the financials they just put out.    Net cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities of (398,376,000).  So they lost almost $400mm in cash from operating activities alone.  Sure, they lost another $728mm from investing in things, but profitable companies do not lose $400mm in cash in a quarter from their operations.  And this isn't a one time thing.  If you look at the annual financials from literally every single year the company has existed their cash flows from operating activities are negative.  

> They reinvested their profits back into the model 3 and other products.

Again, they have no profits.  There are no profits to invest back into the Model 3 or other things.  The cash they have invested in those things has come from the capital markets.  Again, look at the cash flow statement.  The only positive cash flow item is ""Net cash provided by financing activities"" of $371mm in Q1.  The company sells equity and debt to finance their investments.

> Just like Amazon did and they are now hugely successful.

No, no, no.  Amazon actually has (and has had for a very long time) positive cash flow from operating activities.  You can look this up in their financials going back over 10 years.  Amazon invests actual profits back into their business.  That is not what Tesla does at all.  They are not the same.  

> Q3 will show a much lower loss or even profit and massive revenue increase, positive cash flow.

The company has even said they will not show a profit in Q3.  Sure, they said it in a really squirrely way to confuse people, but they said they will only show a profit if you don't count certain (very real) expenses.  And a ton of other things have to go right for them to even get that far.  Revenue should go up a lot, I'll give you that. 

> Q4 will show massive profit enough to fund Model Y which will be the most successful automobile every made.

It really is a cult. "
"I was referring to the problems he had when he initially purchased the Model X. There had been a flaw with the gull wing doors and repair centers were overwhelmed dealing with that issue. As a consequence, the standard of customer service care dropped. Fallout from that was not handled in an ideal way on top of that. Criticism of that event was reasonable. Rectifying the domino effect of situations like that is important for the future of the company. As far as I'm aware, changes were made so recalls would be handled in a more orderly fashion in the future. That's what I meant."
"> Actual for 2017 was -$11.83

That's diluted EPS ( (Net Income - Dividends on Preferred Stock) / (Average Outstanding Shares + Diluted Shares) ).  He was forecasting adjusted EPS (Net + Impairments + Exceptional Expenses + One Time Payments  / Outstanding).  For a fast growing business, there will be a lot of those.  Basically removes capex (nearly $4b in 2017 - which is more than twice his $1.3b estimate) in this case turning a loss of $1.96b into a net profit. 

He also forecast total revenue of $10.7b, when actual ended up being $11.7b.  Sparks significantly underestimated the 2017 capex, but also underestimated revenue.  His numbers were off, but his adjusted EPS wasn't terribly off."
"I do know, I just didn't want to be an ass to you because you clearly don't.  But fuck it - you are wrong, can't you read?

Toni Sacconaghi - (#293 out of 11,207 overall experts)

"He could have, that would have been the adult thing to do :) But guys like Elon, no one tells them what to do and they feel like they can say whatever they want, in particular when they think someone's an idiot. Steve Jobs was the same way."
"Yes, that would have been super easy.  But now it looks like the number waiting to order other configurations is very high and the company did not want to divulge that.  If many people are holding out for the $35k base model it will be very difficult for the company to turn a profit."
"No.

What will happen is that the short seller will write a headline on Seeking Alpha or wherever with just the information they want to get to the market right now.

So for example, Elon says, ""of the reservation holders we invite to configure, about 40% configure and commit to purchase, 10% indicate they are waiting for a cheaper variant, 50% are waiting for AWD (with or without other options) and 10% are waiting for white interiors.""

The headline you will see is, ""Telsa fails to convert 60% of reservations to sales.""

But the reality of the matter is that more than half of the reservation holders are deferring because they want a more expensive Model 3 than is being produced right now.
"
"> Tesla's endgame looks very different.

So GM's ""endgame"" is to have a FSD ride sharing service of Bolts on the road in the next few years.  They already have applications in to put Bolts on the road in the US with no steering wheel.  They are currently updating their facilities in the US to produce these cars next year: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-autonomous/gm-to-invest-100-million-to-upgrade-facilities-to-build-self-driving-cars-idUSKCN1GR2B8

To me, that sounds pretty similar to Tesla's ""endgame"", no?  The difference to me is GM has (i) a huge investment in Lyft so they already have a massive potential user-base, (ii) the manufacturing capability to produce 10 million cars annually, and (iii) FSD technology that has proven to be quite good in urban environments.  I do think GM will have some battery sourcing issues, but the billions in annual profit they currently make should permit them to sort that out without too much trouble.  "
"> If longs are unequivocally good and shorts are unequivocally bad

That argument is a fallacy by hyperbole.

I **did not** claim that all longs are unconditionally ""good"", and I did not claim that all shorts are unconditionally ""bad"". Here's a list of the broad categories:

- shorts against fraudulent companies (not Tesla) are generally useful
- longs of fraudulent companies are generally harmful as they propagate fraud
- failed Tesla shorts are beneficial - although obviously that's not by design it's just instant karma
- successful Tesla shorts are harmful to a broad range of productive entities that I outlined in more detail in my other replies: they are harmful to investors, to Tesla itself, to Tesla employees and to Tesla customers.

At this point I don't think a serious argument can be made about the utility of Tesla, so what remains is the harmful effects of successful Tesla shorts."
"> A long cant buy a share from a short because a short is selling a longs share.

Shorts fundamentally borrow shares and then sell them in the open market. For the duration while the short position is open the short pays interest on the 'loan'. At the end, when the short position is closed, the short buys the shares back and gives them back to the original long, essentially canceling out the loan agreement.

While much of this is automated and for most platforms for small traders the computers don't actually change ownership of any stock, the stock-borrowing action can actually happen in real as well: for example in markets where naked shorting is illegal large-volume shorts often borrow stock from large stockholders, without this transaction going to the open market. They then sell those shares gradually.

**TL;DR:** Yes, you can very much have a short as a counter-party to your stock transaction. Exact details vary by platform and jurisdiction."
"> And what about actual pump and dumps?

Yes, shorting fraudulent firms clearly has a positive market role.

Also, as a counterpoint to that, failed Tesla shorts who lose money are beneficial - if only by accident.

In any case, I carefully qualified all my statements to ""successful Tesla shorts"", not shorts in general - at this point I don't think any credible argument can be made about the positive utility of Tesla in general.
"
"> I'm not going to go through that long winded, convuluted example of yours. My rebuttal is simple, shorts create buying opportunities because when they short a stock, they are selling a longs share, which reduces the overall price. 

If you went through that 'convoluted' example then you'd understand that your rebuttal is false: the fake liquidity created by shorts is **taking money away from longs**.

In the first approximation (putting the effects of stock issuance aside) it's a fundamentally zero-sum game and any income that successful shorts have is at the expense of longs...

Or, as you can see it in the example I gave: the short's profit of $50 was taken from a long-term Tesla investor in that example. I also submit that you can give a counter-example where a successful Tesla short created any sort of value."
"Sure you did, buddy. "
">  Good direct cost position.

lmfao. That's just some made up jargon to justify inflated stock prices.

> Great product. Strong demand.

Doesn't matter if you can't produce enough and make profit on what you do produce, lol.

[Sure they will....](https://i.imgur.com/naNEzNm.gif)"
"Yes I agree that a 6 month delay wouldn't have a material impact. But further delays could, (ie. if a bunch of reservations were waiting on a features that weren't going to be available for a years) you know because of the whole discounting of the cash flows that we discussed.

Not sure why are are talking about ""15 comments ago"" I have responded to you twice."
">Demand is not a constraint, and will not be for the next few quarters, so there's no need to discuss it in this quarterly earnings call.

Just to add one final comment, yes it may not be a constraint in the near term, however if analysts see that in reality a certain percentage of orders end up in sales (say 40%) but they are currently modelling 60% of orders resulting a sale they will want to update their model based on this new data. The fact that you keep saying ""don't worry about stuff way down the road, only worry about the near term"" seems strange as you clearly understand that analys models go out way into the future and they do care about the ""1,000 miles away"", it has an impact on the valuation of the company. That is the whole point of a DCF model, to model out well into the future.

I'm not following you.  Pretty much the only adjustments Tesla makes are for stock comp - I'm going off the last page of the earnings press releases where they run through adjustments (there are a few other small ones but that's the biggie).   Plus capex is not expensed and doesn't show up in EPS - only depreciation does.
So what? Do you think a random short seller writing an article on seeking alpha will kill Tesla? Why do you think that article would do anything at all to the stock price unless other people agreed with his logic?
"Sorry I misspoke. What I meant to say is that the market for mobility will be very different in 10 years, so that makes the current value of GM's business not very valuable, because it will no longer exist in that form, which is why the market is discounting it from a price/earnings perspective. 

Strangely enough, if you consider that both GM and Tesla are aiming for the same end game and the race is still up in the air, an equal valuation is actually fair value at this point.

I think there are slight variations on the autonomous electric mobility market that make a big difference. One model is the Google/Cruise model where the OEM owns the cars and runs a tax service. Another is Tesla's target, where they sell the cars and also serve as the Uber for the robo taxis. The former model is dangerous, because the robotaxi market is price sensitive and prices will continue to decline, so owning a robotaxi is similar to the solar industry, you're spending a bunch of money for continually declining margins. Selling the car to the consumer is much more viable financially. GM can also do this but its not clear they're really focused on this path, as you really need to be going for a vision first path to do this, not a lidar first path like Cruise is doing. If you believe that the Tesla's model is really the future, it would be really dumb to buy Uber/Lyft shares, as OEM's could simply cut them out.

The OEMs are about 5 years behind in terms of battery supply. Even with all the money in the world they can only go so quickly.
"
"You're right, I think it's clear that's what you meant when you said the short sold a stock to the long. So I take back my specific qualm here. "
"I don't know where to begin with that example man. The financial markets are so much more complex than that. What if in your example the short covers at 300, and the long never sells until 400. Then everyone wins in that scenario. Your entire scenario hinges on a long selling at a lower price, lets take that away and then what? If a short's thesis is wrong, he will lose money. If a longs thesis is right, he'll make money. Not to mention you take a complex market and reduce it to three participants, yet you talk about the price fluctuating. What about the other long and shorts in this scenario that actually make the price fluctuate? Do we ignore there gains and losses? What about the other shorts, in your scenario that you laid out that drove the price down. Did they cover? Did they make money? There is so much wrong with your example, there's a reason why I called it convoluted. 

A simple google search will yield results you clearly need to read. Please check out https://www.ft.com/content/cb22ac84-3cdb-11e0-bbff-00144feabdc0 "
"Yeah, I understand that, I do data for a living and build models.

I just don't think those models are in any way helpful to Tesla, they're helpful to the analysts.

If your job depends on me doing X, but my job is to do Y and I face no negative consequences from not helping you, then I have no need to help.

Been in a couple conversations on this thread so apologies about the 15 comments, seems to add up quickly :)."
"If it includes sales locations then that's also investment -- no way to have good presence in all of these countries *and* make full use of that infrastructure when you're only selling two cars.  

And they aren't outsourcing service to make money either, as a matter of course with the intent of setting themselves apart from others.  

Hardline expansion mode and near perfect efficiency with established infrastructure is impossible to achieve at the same time."
"There's no logic in the market. You can try to use logic, but there's no logic behind yesterday's massive selling spree other than, ""Elon was mean to investors on a conference call."" So when a recognised name punts an article headlined, ""Tesla fails to convert 60% of reservations"" the market will knee-jerk in response. The rational recovery that happens after people actually read the article will be slower than the knee-jerk because reading takes time, assuming it's done at all and the trader hasn't moved on to the next knee-jerk reaction.

The answer to the ""boneheaded"" question is in the report. The answer to the conversion rate question is meaningless: Tesla keeps getting new reservations faster than they sell cars, they sell every car they build and will continue to do so for the medium term. What the actual conversion rate is, is meaningless.
"
"> One model is the Google/Cruise model where the OEM owns the cars and runs a tax service.  The former model is dangerous, because the robotaxi market is price sensitive and prices will continue to decline, so owning a robotaxi is similar to the solar industry, you're spending a bunch of money for continually declining margins.

I don't disagree with that, but GM hasn't said they'll stop selling cars and Google's model will likely involve selling/licensing their technology to other OEMs.  

> GM can also do this but its not clear they're really focused on this path, as you really need to be going for a vision first path to do this, not a lidar first path like Cruise is doing

Not sure what this means - GM's tech uses lidar along with computer vision.  "
"> What if in your example the short covers at 300, and the long never sells until 400.

The short can only cover at 300 if *some other long* sells to him². In that case the ""convoluted example"" becomes even more complex by adding one more market participant (""Long-C"") - but the underlying principle is still the same:

... it's a zero-sum game, shorts can *only* make money at the expense of longs - and while doing that they cause other collateral damage as well.

(Putting aside other factors such as stock issuance, converting bonds, stock based mergers, etc., etc.)

"Hah no worries. I guess I look at it from a different perspective. I used to work in Investor Relations and come from the view that having the market on your side is very beneficial to the company. Yes the analysts are not directly ""helping"" the company, however the investment community/analyst community (both buy and sell side) are very critical to the performance of the companies stock which impacts share price (which ultimately can impact employee retention/the ability to attract top talent, financing, raising capital etc). Which can have a huge impact on the ultimate success of a company.

Not saying that Tesla has a problem with any of this at the moment (or even into the near future), but to discount the impact that the investment community has on a company (and claim that there are no negative consequences by not helping you) is a little naive in my opinion. 

There is a reason why there is an entire function (IR) within most reputable companies to interact with the investors and analysts to make sure that the understand the story and the value proposition  that you want them to, and then for them to communicate the story that you want them to to their clients. If you don't help them understand the details then they will just make up their own assumptions (likely with some bias) and that is what the big investment firms will be making their investment decisions based on. They very much have an influence on the company."
"Watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_lBL2yhU5A

around 25:00 he talks about map light and map heavy approaches. Google and Cruise are doing map heavy approaches using lidar as far as I know."
"You already added other market participants to your example when you said other shorts drove down the price to 300. The example was simplified to the point of absurdity and added no value to the discussion. 

The original point was that shorts create buying opportunities. For a real market, that doesn't consist of two longs and 1 short, this is absolutely true. If shorts drive the price down, then other longs (who may not currently be in the market, or want to add to their position) can buy more shares for cheaper. If the long thesis is correct, they will gain more money. Your qualifier of ""successful shorts"" is also ridiculous given the context of the point being made. The point was that shorts create buying opportunities, not ""successful shorts create buying opportunities."" "
My view is that cars for geo-fenced ride-sharing services will come out first because the computational requirements needed for that application are much less.  But I do not think GM or Waymo are not working towards a solution that can be sold to the public and works in areas that are not fully mapped as well.  The sensor/camera suites and software they seem to be working on seems to be working towards that - maps are just a huge crutch.  Lidar strikes me as just a helpful tool regardless of the application.  
"> If shorts drive the price down, then other longs (who may not currently be in the market, or want to add to their position) can buy more shares for cheaper. 

That's another scenario, but it doesn't help your argument, at all, because that scenario makes it *even worse*:

- If shorts drive down the price and make money then as a primary effect they have earned money from some long who sold to them when they close their positions.
- You are right about the secondary effect of having driven down the price, where other longs might also buy cheaper, *but only at the expense of lower sales price for even longer-term longs*.

I.e. shorts **purely** cause loss in the marketplace:

- they hurt the income of longer term investors, plus all the other significant negative externalities of volatility I listed (higher financing costs, lower Tesla employee retention, lower Tesla employee income, etc. etc.),
- they transfer income from longer term investors (who were right about going long but sold in the ""wrong"" moment) to shorter term investors - i.e. they dilute the pool of investors, hurting long term investors while rewarding short-termism.

So no, this example doesn't work either - in all these discussions you still haven't come up with a *single* advantage of shorts, which is pretty telling ...
"
"Okay this is the comment you highlighted in your original comment I responded to.

>If you want to get long TSLA, the shorts create buying opportunities for you :)

Then you said ""That's a common misconception and it's not actually true."" 

and then to back this statement up, you provided an example of 3 market participants, where the price is magically fluctuating, to show that the one short in that scenario doesn't actually create a buying opportunity. In the context of your original point, this example is nonsense.

You agree that shorts provide downward pressure on the price. Certainly, that creates buying opportunities, for some longs, right? If its at the expense of other longs, that's fine, and irrelevant in the context of this ""misconception"" you're trying to bust. If I have never invested in Tesla before, but decided to do so when it hit 250 recently, then absolutely the shorts helped create that buying opportunity for me. Without shorts, it would have never gotten that low. If that's not a buying opportunity, if that doesn't count, if this is truly a misconception, please explain to me how that scenario wasn't an aided buying opportunity with the help of shorts. I saw you make a comment earlier saying unsuccessful shorts actually help longs, so I'm really not sure what you're path to victory in this argument is. It seems like you agree with me, and perhaps just misworded your original response. 

I do think shorts provide positive utility to the marketplace, but that is not the argument I originally responded to. Depending on your response, I may be willing to debate that aspect further.

Good on CR for re-testing so quickly.  Good on Tesla for fixing this.
"“I’ve been at CR for 19 years and tested more than 1,000 cars,” said Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, “and I’ve never seen a car that could improve its track performance with an over-the-air update.”"
"Elons comment:

>Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from @ConsumerReports. Road noise & ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month.

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1001863039308595201"
"Have to call out the bear BS again, see how the the narrative changes: from Elon can't do it (https://twitter.com/NetflixAndLamp/status/999429946648006656) to, after they do it, the brake pads will now fail https://twitter.com/NetflixAndLamp/status/1001876959381639169"
"This is such an excellent example of the power of the OTA updates design in Tesla. Any other manufacturer would be physically pulling in their entire fleet. 

It's interesting to me how a number of news outlets were jumping on the ""let's beat up Tesla"" bandwagon a week ago. Some of them were crowing about the problem and I bet they won't be anywhere near as loud telling people it was fixed easily and remotely. Clicks are a cruel mistress and bad news sells."
Over the air updates are such a huge cost savings (especially for recalls) vs other manufacturers.  
TLDR: CR re-tested and got 60-0mph stopping distance of 133 feet. 
And this is what the spirit of journalism should be like: telling the unbiased truth in a timely manner. Well done CR.
BRAKING NEWS!
"> Until now, that type of remote improvement to a car’s basic functionality had been unheard of. “I’ve been at CR for 19 years and tested more than 1,000 cars,” said Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, “and I’ve  never seen a car that could improve its track performance with an over-the-air update.”

Car 2.0"
From PR disaster to technology showcase. Amazing.
And last week the NY Times had an editiorial claiming the Model 3 was a lemon based on Consumer Reports rating.  Now it is a CR recommendation!
That was really fast
"This updated CR report proves how objective and unbiased CR is.   

Thank you CR for pointing out Model 3’s braking deficiency resulting in correction and safer Model 3.  

Thanks Tesla for prompt correction of braking deficiency.  However, this should have been caught and corrected during development.  Some buyers have driven around for more than 6-9 months with suboptimal braking system. "
We’re living in the future!
I wonder how long it will take for people to realize the technology disruption Tesla has created. OTA combined with functionality is just one of those innovations that Elon Musk has been talking about. There are other EVs around but only Tesla has truly built a viable alternative to ICE cars.
"The biggest advantage Tesla vehicles have over other automakers' vehicles? OTA update.

Fixing a brake issue through a software update is unheard of. This is literally a laptop with 4 wheels. Continuous upgrades through software improvement makes it more technological advanced than any legacy automakers. When automakers have millions of vehicles on the roads, they would be dying for just flipping a switch to remedy tons of problems."

">Now, when drivers adjust their seat position using the power controls along the edge of the driver’s seat, prompts to adjust the car’s mirrors and steering-wheel position appear on the center touch screen.

Didn't know the update also changed how mirror adjustment prompt pop-up when physically adjusting seat power controls. Anyone got a picture of that?"
The road noise issue is frustrating for current owners. It's my only major issue. I wish they can fix it for my current car. It's way too loud.
How many more ft to be class leading?
What's CR?
My LEAF has to be taken into a dealer for software updates. Why is no one else goin to OTA updates like Tesla?
"Missed the ""Braking News!"" headline potential."
"I really think time will tell with the touchscreen, but I found their complaints to be a bit unfounded.  We have a five year old Subaru Forester which was the top choice in its class by CR, and one of its highest scores overall.  I'm now switching back and forth between it and my Model 3 with enough regularity that I can fairly compare two interfaces that are both familiar to me.  There is no question the Subaru takes me longer to make basic adjustments like climate and radio due to its unintuitive button layout and cumbersome touch screen organization.  As for navigation, that isn't even in the same league.  I have the map on in the subaru purely for decorative purposes.  It is useless as a navigation tool.  What makes this such an issue of concern for the Model 3, yet hardly worth a mention in a glowing review for the subaru?  "
Wonder what all the haters that were trashing CR last week are now thinking.
What was the braking problem?
But but but the Shorts said .... 
Worth nothing is that it improved braking on the same car where CR originally got one good result then got a bad result. Meaning that it's possible the bad result wasn't caused by damaged or worn out brakes as some thought. Maybe it was slightly different test procedure or on a different surface? Tesla's official statement on the change made to improve it was fairly vague. I suppose it could be that the software adapts it's braking behavior when it detects worn out brakes. 
Wow huge!!!!!
How many feet did it take previously to stop from 60?

So what's a good stopping distance? I imagine something like 10ft would be hitting like a brick wall. 
Would it help if you install ceramic brake pads in the car?
[deleted]
this really reaffirms my faith in tesla. I mean they fixed the brakes across the entire fleet with a friggin' over the air software update ... I'm living in the future!
i'd like to see what kind of horse shit anti shills over at r/cars can come up with this news bit. last time they were trashing tesla so bad and saying it's impossible to improve the braking with software. tesla fixed it almost immediately too.
Made a video explaining what happened with the ABS braking issue and the firmware update of the calibration algorithm and the edge case that caused the inconsistent braking problem in the first place. Thanks to Orange_C and others. https://youtu.be/NGl_qm9myqM
Sounds like Tesla was once again distracted by difficult stuff and got complacent with the easy stuff.
[deleted]
👏👏👏
Did they do the brake test with retentive braking disabled? So with regeneration on it will be even better? 
Amazing what they can do via OTA.
I was a skeptic that this would work and Tesla proved me wrong.  Kudos to Tesla.
[deleted]
TBH that's still pretty crappy breaking from a modern car.
"133 feet is better than 150, but it's still not particularly good. A BMW M3 stops needs 30% less distance to stop."
ELON ELON ELON! ELON! 
[removed]
Why exactly didn’t they make the stopping distance shorter in the first place?? That’s the real question 
"> Good on CR for re-testing so quickly. Good on Tesla for fixing this.

Yes, and note that Tesla is not stopping there, [Elon Musk has made the following promise:](
https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/998777288559755264):

> ""Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. **With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car.**""

So we can expect Model 3 braking distance to get even better with future iterations.

Also, at this point I think it's fair to point out how safe the Model 3 is - here's a very recent example: [""Tesla Model 3 saves family from serious injury after being rear-ended at high speed""](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8n7ky7/tesla_model_3_saves_family_from_serious_injury/).

The family's Model 3 apparently first sacrificed its rear trunk (which has no gas tank in it...) as a rear crunch zone to cushion the high speed impact from the speeding car - and then the front trunk was the crunch zone as the car collided with concrete barriers.
"
Yep. I think this is a great example of CR taking an active role and doing what they can to improve the overall quality of the products they're reviewing. And this is also a great example of why Tesla is the bestla!
"Or, you know, they could just properly test the product and fix issues before selling it to customers..."
[removed]
"Don't characterize this as an OTA software update improving performance. This is an OTA fix of a terrible software flaw. The model 3 has good suspension, good tires, good brake rotors and calipers and pads. If the braking distance was so poor to begin with, it was only the fault of the software. "
"Also

>	Braking & UI upgrades apply to all Model 3s. Improved windshield for aero noise & suspension for ride comfort are major ops. Unless you’re really bothered by them, don’t replace. Best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. 45 psi is best range, but lower comfort."
I'm assuming road noise / road comfort can only be improved during the production of the car.  Makes me wonder what can be done to the models produced earlier?
"> UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month.

So tomorrow?

I still don't trust them generally, tho, after being a subscriber for years. Always hope to see other reviews confirming their findings."

"In other news, [Fiat Chrysler has announced a massive recall of 4.8 million vehicles in the United States](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/25/17393664/fiat-chrysler-recall-cruise-control-stuck-software) over concerns that they could get stuck in cruise control. 

> FCA is urging customers with affected vehicles to **avoid using cruise control until they visit a service center to have the car’s software upgraded.**"
If it bleeds it leads...
"I'm a fan of OTA updates, especially if it is upgrading, improving or adding useful features. However, I'm not a fan if this allows a rush to market for key safety features just because they can be fixed at a later time. Braking issues is something that should have been caught earlier."
"On the other hand, any other manufacturer would have checked to make sure the brakes worked before starting to sell its new model. That whole ""beta"" production testing thing that Tesla skipped this round."
If it wasn't a safety issue I would think they did this on purpose \- twice the media exposure.
"> Over the air updates are such a huge cost savings (especially for recalls) vs other manufacturers. 

Exactly, OTA updates when done right are not just cost savings for the manufacturer, but there's advantages to customers as well, compared to the system of traditional recalls:

- Faster updates means customers won't be exposed to the bug days, weeks or even months long to a known bug, i.e. it's ultimately *safer*.
- Even a ""free"" mandatory recall with a traditional carmaker is not truly free to the customer: it involves a trip to the car service, which is lost time and is a general PITA which causes a fair percentage of customers to delay that trip to the service.

Although the car maker is clearly not liable for it because it was the customer who didn't follow the recall, the traditional recall system exposes customers to more danger.
"
"but that can't fix any mechanical issues - other manufactures new vehicles also get OTA updates. 

I'm more curious what the software issue was that was affecting the physical performance "
"Not class leading as promised, but much better than the 152 ft in previous tests. (Correction: Elon said that would be in future updates, not this one.)

But 133 is apparently in line with what Tesla has achieved in their internal tests, so it might be on par with their design spec and could be better with the Sports wheel set. And there’s the performance variant that should have better brakes, IIRC. 

This article also suggests that the Model X stops in 127 ft for anyone wondering. "
The original stopping distance was what again?
[removed]
"That's Tesla's ultimate goal, gonna be exciting to watch them try."
https://imgflip.com/i/2bai0c
I'm fine with a wait until the Super Bowl halftime to roll out summon for Model 3...
Just fell short of CR recommendation equaled lemon to NYT? Editorial by the hack journalist that pushed hard for the Iraq war.
"The opinion piece if anyone missed it: https://nyti.ms/2GPE0Bz

And their regular news article from earlier that week: https://nyti.ms/2GBaTBL"
"Yes, but usually you don’t brake hard from 60-0 three times in a row. Glad it’s improved, but wasn’t really a real world concern. "
"> Some buyers have driven around for more than 6-9 months with suboptimal braking system.

To be fair, ""shit happens"", here's recent examples of Toyota, Nissan and Mercedes recalling cars due to brake system problems:

> TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION (TMC) announces a recall related to the software program that controls the antilock braking system (ABS) in current-model ""Prius"", ""Prius Plug-in Hybrid"", ""Sai"" and ""HS250h"" sold in Japan.
>
http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/news/10/02/0209.html
>
>
 >   Nissan Motor Co. is recalling more than 188,000 Nissan and Infiniti SUVs worldwide to fix faulty brake control software that could increase the risk of a crash.
>
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nissan-recalls-over-188000-suvs-to-fix-brakes/
>
>
>   Mercedes recalled almost two million SL500s and E-Class vehicles in 2004-05 and ended up scrapping its brake-by-wire Sensotronic Brake Control system for its major models.
>
https://www.zdnet.com/article/prius-recall-pales-next-to-faulty-software-in-mercedes-sensotronic-brakes/
>

Some of these brake system failures were worse than Tesla's *and* remained undiscovered for a far longer time than 6-9 months.

Bugs are a fact of life with complex high-tech products, what matters is how quickly the manufacturer reacts to a report about a defect - and Tesla's response was, as CR pointed it out, exemplary and unprecedented in its speed.
"
">This is literally a iPad ~~laptop~~ with 4 wheels.

(No keyboard!) 😃"
"To be fair, it was bad software that caused the brake issue. They did not increase the size of the master brake cylinder or the coefficient of friction of the pads by the OTA update. The brake performance on the initial CR test was poor because Tesla had bad software controlling the braking system. "
">Fixing a brake issue through a software update is unheard of. This is literally a laptop with 4 wheels.

You're not wrong, but most modern cars are. Tesla is only ahead of the game in OTA updates, but some others are following suit."
Narh the thing that is unheard of is fixing it over the air. Normally you would have to go to the service center and get a software update. 
Bow Chica wow wow. 
"> The forums were full of people who said it was impossible to fix with a software update 

And the same people are now proclaiming that other car maker did software updates for decades and the Tesla is only reinventing the wheel.

It's almost as if the income of Tesla shorts depended on painting Tesla in a negative light, regardless of the truth! 😉
"
Early adopter pains. Comes with the territory of being first.
">Braking & UI upgrades apply to all Model 3s. Improved windshield for aero noise & suspension for ride comfort are major ops. Unless you’re really bothered by them, don’t replace. Best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. 45 psi is best range, but lower comfort.

"When is your Model 3 from? Mine (164xx, picked up earlier this month) is pretty darn quiet."
23xxx here with 18in and it seems to be much quieter than my 2013 Leaf on the same road and speed. Maybe I should install a DB meter on my phone and see if it is just my imagination though.
When did your car get manufactured? Elon's most recent tweet say's it is already fixed.
"Elon has just tweeted regarding this

>	Braking & UI upgrades apply to all Model 3s. Improved windshield for aero noise & suspension for ride comfort are major ops. Unless you’re really bothered by them, don’t replace. Best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. 45 psi is best range, but lower comfort.

Not clear if they’ll actually upgrade on request, though. "
"It is possible that they could fix this through an OTA.  Honda, and I'm sure other automakers, use active noise cancelling \(like Bose\) to reduce the apparent cabin noise.  Not sure if Tesla does this yet, but if they don't, this could reduce a lot of the tire drone."
"While I never needed it for safety, it was fun to have my BMW M3 stop from 60mph in about 100'  Talk about passengers eyeballs bugging out. :) "
"Depends what class you put it in. Aside from acceleration I don't think it's especially sporty so I'd put it in the compact sedan class with a Civic, Corolla, Sentra, etc. so, without doing any research, I'd say 130 ft. is pretty close. Maybe 120 to top all of those."
"http://www.motortrend.com/news/20-best-60-to-0-distances-recorded/

43 feet to be overall leading and less than 33 feet to lead in the class.  I wonder how the 60-0 breaking distance will be on the performance Model 3 than we can directly compare it to the M3."
**C**onsumer **R**eports.
"Great question and it points to what’s so special about tesla.

In order to reduce risk and focus on production, OEMs like Nissan sell their cars through dealerships that are independently owned and operated. In order to protect these owners, there is some combo of contract and regulatory requirements that after a car is sold to a customer, absolutely no changes can be made by the oem unless they come through a dealership. Dealers live off the fees for servicing and repairing cars. So, because Nissan has built its business model to include the leech of a middleman we call dealers, you have to drive in and pay to get a change that Nissan is technically capable of equipping their cars to do remotely. But they are not at all legally capable of doing so. And due to this being a legal restriction to protect dealers, it can’t and won’t change any time soon. OEMs aren’t legally allowed to sell to end users. This is a big reason tesla didn’t include dealers. They are simply middle men who have to get a cut to survive and often ruin the customer experience. 

Moral of the story is, if you want to get continuous OTA updates, your only option is tesla"
"Yes, I would like to see more dings for the truly annoying UI/UX's other manufacturer's make.  We rented a new Pacifica Limited for a weekend trip, and it had a very beautiful screen, but that interface was NOT safe to use while driving.  Everything was four clicks deep in non-intuitive places."
[Read the original report.](https://www.consumerreports.org/hybrids-evs/tesla-model-3-review-falls-short-of-consumer-reports-recommendation/)
"The way ABS works is that it detects when the wheel is about to lock up and modulates braking pressure to prevent lock up till the car stops. So the software probably had some edge case where it was letting off braking pressure too liberally. 

CR’s pretty thorough and scientific with their testing. Wouldn’t put much weight on the question of whether they maintained consistent testing conditions. 20 feet is a massive difference."
"Musk said the calibration issue arose with *repeated* heavy braking events. So it worked the first time correctly, but after that it fell out of spec for whatever reason. "
Probably didn’t change anything.  Placebo effect lmao
"Before: 152 ft

Now: 133 ft"
152 feet
"~130 in the first stop, 152' in all subsequent (including next-day) stops.

Back down to ~130 once again post-update, and seems to keep that distance steady."
The best manage ~100 feet or even a bit less.
"Model 3 with 19” wheels have a different default tire, the Continental ProContact and Motortrend tested that at 119’ stopping distance without this new software.

A tire with more traction will perform even better, but there is a trade off with rolling resistance."

Shouldn't be comparing to a BMW M3... Maybe the performance model 3 but that will have different specs.  A 3 series stops in about 123 ft. Model 3 weighs a few hundred pounds more. So we'll see what other changes come to the 3 to close that 10ft gap.

">Also, at this point I think it's fair to point out how safe the Model 3 is - here's a very recent example

This is nothing but an anecdote. Modern cars are generally very safe. We've made it a priority as a society, and I've seen lots of amazing crashes where everyone involved walked away from a variety of cars and trucks.

Safety should be measured with scientific crash test results, not anecdotes."
[deleted]
Shit happens.  Everyone has recalls.  FCA just recalled 5 million vehicles.  I'm just glad it was dealt with right away once it was uncovered.
"That's a much less likely scenario since Microsoft has to deal with millions of hardware configurations and overlapping software/drivers. Tesla, much like Apple, has standardized hardware so testing can be done on a small sample and still yield favorable results when pushed to the consumer."
"This is inevitable with OTAs. I can’t think of specific examples, but there were some small bugs (nothing major) that some owners complained about following some updates. "
"Or, more likely, they get their rating and then revert to the previous settings because that's how they wanted them in the first place.

Less likely for a braking issue--I can't think of a reason they'd want a longer braking distance--but there are other performance metrics that look good for ratings but bad for consumer experience, and OTA updates make that kind of gamification very likely."
“Your car is installing updates and will now restart” while driving. 
"I didn’t characterize anything. I posted a direct quote from a professional, with no commentary. You can direct your criticisms at Consumer Reports."
"You are completely taking CRs original article as gospel, aren’t you? They have zero credibility to me since their Model S rating, then retraction. It’s become quite clear to me they have their own agenda here, and it taints their reviews of Tesla."
45 psi is crazy high
">	Makes me wonder what can be done to the models produced earlier?

Sometimes nothing easy. In the Sandy Munro review he pointed out that a door soundproofing materiel was just cut the same for both sides, instead of a mirror image for the other side. This meant that one side of the car the sound proofing has the wrong side facing out"

"Haha u must be new here, next month in 2019"
I am also pretty confused and skeptic bout this whole sequence of events. I wonder how much TSLA stock CR and CR employees bought before releasing this article...
What brake pads are you buying that fail in a couple weeks worth of hard braking so I can avoid them...
"To be fair, your chances of this happening are probably less than winning the lottery.

> While unlikely, FCA says, there’s a chance that [ cruise control accelerating to match set speed ] could happen at the same time as a short circuit in a “specific electrical network” in the car, which could leave the car stuck in cruise control.

So you need a short circuit while in a particular state. It sounds like this has never actually happened and was found during rigorous testing of to be released vehicles using the same hardware. It's amazing they even found this issue since it's such an unlikely scenario. Chances are that even if this bug wasn't found, nobody would experience it, they probably artificially induced this scenario in testing.

Tesla, on the other hand, had an issue that should have been easily found with basic testing procedures. Tesla would never find rare issues like this because they don't have very rigorous testing procedures."

"I had the ""passenger airbag of death"" in my Evo for *months* because there's no Mitsubishi dealers near me anymore and it was a pain in the ass.

"
"> the traditional recall system exposes customers to more danger.

If an OTA can fix a critical system, it can also break one. The system will only be as good as the manufacturer's testing procedures.

Recalls will still happen with Teslas. Every carmaker deals with mechanical issues. Not much changes there. Adding software simply adds complexity and more potential issues to fix."
"This issue only affected repeated hard braking. After an original adequate hard brake event, I suspect that one of the following   would occur:

* Software not taking into account effect of heat on brake pads dynamically;
* Some sort of bug in a (hypothetical) brake ""learning algorithm"" that adjusts brake force required depending on heat, wear, etc. over time;
* A (hypothetical) brake ""learning algorithm"" that is too sensitive and adapts too quickly to inputs provided by artificial repeated 0-60 breaking attempts."
Panic stops will always trigger ABS on normal shitty tires.  ABS is controlled by a computer.
"> Not class leading as promised, but much better than the 152 ft in previous tests. But 133 is apparently in line with what Tesla has achieved in their internal tests, so it might be on par with their design spec and could be better with the Sports wheel set.

Sure cause the headlines are SOOOOO FAIR
"NYT was busted driving a tesla in circles for hours trying to run out of battery so they could claim it sucks, and failed because slow driving a tesla can get nearly 700 miles of range which they didn't count on, so they had the car towed when it was still not empty and tesla proved it after they ran the lying story.  "
"Multiple rapid braking and fading is mechanical issue from heat build up. That would require hardware change or brake pad change. 

From Elon’s posting, it is ABD algorithm problem.  CR uses same methods all vehicles they test.  All scientific testings are done in multiple trials to reduce a random chance.  

"
"Also to be fair, CR said they got <130 ft their first try, it was only 150+ on the subsequent tries. So in the real world, its not common at all to have to slam on your brakes multiple times. "
"Yes, as cool as this is it's also troubling. Imagine the current model for smartphones where some % of devices are inevitably bricked or hobbled by a software update. Now apply that to a 4000 lb missile driving on public roads.

If they could have a bad breaking software update 2 months ago they could have another one next month. Maybe the next glitch is that is completely turns the breaks off when one wheel loses traction.

I said this when the problem first came out and I'll stick to it, cars should come from the factory with their breaking system as good as it's going to get. I don't like ota for critical systems."
"I was trying to find that clip of Clarkson complaining about F1 engines being re-tuned and oil being re-routed mid race, remotely, from a laptop in the pits, but I can’t remember which series that was in."
"> Early adopter pains. Comes with the territory of being first.

So I got the impression that if they do go to a service centre and complain, it will get addressed.

I believe even if Tesla doesn't spell it out explicitly, they *are* grateful to their early adopters for taking some risks with an early product, and are treating them well. It should not be any real expense to Tesla anyway, due to the slow ramp-up.
"
wish it would be made more clear around what day produced/vin these changes were made

Awesome! Thanks.
Mine is in the 9xxx so I must have missed it. It looks to be an issue with the windshield which is actually possible to retrofit. What car were you driving before?
I did a decibel test with my phone and it's about 61/62 on average.
"I'd be very interested to hear the result, I'm picking up a 23xxx in 2 days."
phone db meter apps are usually crap. 
I think he’s aware it’s fixed. Just wants the fix for his car. 
9xxx VIN range. I don't think I made the fix.
You always need it for safety. It didn't happen that someone or something didn't jump in front of your car. Short stopping distance is almost always good (unless someone with bad breaks rear-ends you)
"Given that the Model 3 (in near any spec) is faster than that M3, it would stand to reason it'd have comparable brakes. 133 feet is still well-shy of ' top-in-class performance', it's just mid-pack now. That's fine for most drivers, regardless. 

Nearing that 100' mark would be excellent, but I'm not sure that's physically possible due to the construction/pad/size of the brakes."
"The issue was that that persisted, the braking performance pre-OTA-fix did not improve even after leaving the car overnight. 

That edge case ended up being the car's new 'standard' distance, so the software glitched out after one emergency stop, and did not de-glitch or reset afterwards, but was capable of doing so after an update.

Did Tesla only test emergency braking once in total? A fresh car for each test? How did no engineers notice this? I'm a little at a loss as to how something like that was missed until now, I'm glad it was such an easy fix, but still.... wat."

Any modern ABS system has software on it. Just no one else updates it if it's wrong or only at the dealership if it's bad enough to require recall\-\-customers just live w/ it because that's what they expect out of cars.
"> It's actually nuts they can fix braking with software

To be fair, the reason they were able to fix it via an OTA update is that the bug was in the (calibration) software to begin with, not in any physical part of the brake system.

Tesla can't fix brake pads via OTA updates. ^\(At ^least ^not ^yet.\)

In any case I find it very nice how Tesla has embraced Apple's method of fixing and improving the software even years after the hardware is sold, and unlikely many other car makers Tesla doesn't charge for the updates. This is how it should work.
"
"Remember that brakes can easily exceed the coefficient of friction and it's the ABS requlating the stopping force to keep the ground patch of the tire from breaking free from the road. That's all software and sensors.  To add to that, regeneration of hybrid systems may be even quicker to react than the mechanical braking system, allowing further reduction of stopping distance by reaching the maximum braking force more quickly.

Disclaimer: I don't know anything about brakes, just theorizing on how they *might* be able to achieve performance through updating software."
"I tried to cheat and do my own brakes. Not too hard if you know what you're doing.

Not a year later they are vibrating and grinding like an afterprom dance floor."
"Conversely, it's scary that there's so much software involved in your braking. As someone who works in software, I have a fear about its stability.
"

">  I've seen lots of amazing crashes where everyone involved walked away from a variety of cars and trucks.

Which is just as anecdotal, contradicted by an easy search of nasty vehicle fires magnified by gasoline:

- [ICE vehicle explosion engulfing firemen](https://youtu.be/v1Ld2gW6OfY)

and in higher speed accidents the subsequent gasoline fires, enabled by the explosive air-fuel mixture that is [also used in warfare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmRASCHJe2Q) are often engulfing the whole car very quickly, giving no time for victims to escape.

"> Microsoft has to deal with millions of hardware configurations and overlapping software/drivers.

An often overlooked, yet highly important piece when users lob criticisms at Microsoft. The cross-section of hardware and software configuration makes it virtually impossible for Microsoft to test every permutation.

"I can give you one right now. I own a p100d model S.

I believe this is why they stagger updates. If there is a bug it hits the least number of customers possible.

"Rigorous testing procedures my ass.

I thought you actually have to manually start the update. Kinda like on a phone? 
"> Furthermore, less than 80% of cars come in for recall work.

BTW., do you perhaps have a link to any actual real-world data showing the actual percentage? I'm genuinely curious but couldn't find much on the Internet. (Which I suspect signals that the actual numbers of recall success are ... unflattering to the traditional automotive industry.)

"Actually it was 132ft. CR's first test was to spec.  It was their second test that had the 152ft.  The media and CR have been somewhat misleading on this point by just claiming the car only stopped in 152ft.

Clearly there was an issue only affecting subsequent emergency stops and tesla fixed it."
Didn't top gear try to do the same thing? 
"Again, I didn’t say it shouldn’t be fixed, but CR even said the first of 3 test was normal. Real world you don’t need to brake that hard 3 times in 10 mins. Which is why Tesla didn’t catch it.  "
"""In our testing of the Model 3, the first stop we recorded was significantly shorter (around 130 feet, similar to Tesla’s findings), but that distance was not repeated, even after we let the brakes cool overnight.""

Overnight is the issue here, back to back would be more understandable, but if it can't repeat it after a 12 hour rest then something is wrong."
"Yeah like Tesla is the first cars to fix a brake issue with some software. They are not.
So you would rather have bad brakes than get an update? Sounds stupid.
You do know that there is a difference between Android update(which fit 100 of different hardware) and a tesla update(which only have the hardware Tesla put in them). It is many times more likely that an android update will cause a critical bug than a tesla update. Even then Tesla is gonna find a critical bug before the update is released to all cars. Maybe expect if it a once in a life time event, but that's unlikely. "
"2000 miata and 2008 Acura tl. Obviously, the model 3 is miles ahead of the miata in almost every way, but the 3 is also dramatically quieter (rattles, wind, tires) than the tl. "
Hmmm I'm in the 9xxx range and don't notice any significant road noise
That kind of sucks. Can the service center help reduce the noise with extra padding or replacing some of the existing padding \(assuming new models use better padding\)?
"Well yeah, of course. My point was that in the 10 years I owned that car I never actually needed to use the full capabilities of the braking system on the road to keep myself safe. I used it in AutoX and to show car enthusiast friends what it could do on an empty back road, and surely it was good to know the capability was there.

Interestingly, I DID very often have to adjust my braking and purposefully brake lighter than I might have, or started braking earlier than I actually needed to so that the idiots behind me wouldn't end up in my rear seats. I lost track of the times I had to glance in my rear view, see a conversion van from 1980 about a car length from my bumper and then slooooooooooowly apply the brakes before coming up to a sharp corner that I could have waited 10 more seconds for and taken at twice the speed.

So, the takeaway is drive smart and be aware regardless of your hardware. :)"
"The performance model is getting larger brakes and calipers though. So, the ""base"" Model 3 might not beat the performance models from BMW and Audi, but I'd expect the performance model to."
"Other than the Performance version, all Model 3 configurations are slower than an M3.  

The brakes are not always the limiting power for braking either, the suspension and road contact patch \(wheel size & tire pressure\) play an important role as well."
"It's not the brakes that are going to be the problem.  3 is much heavier, and has much shittier tires.  It'll never stop as fast as an M3 in the base configs because of that."
just re googled. we are both wrong. they are electromagneticly assisted instead of vacum assisted breaks. still hydrolic just not standard. 
"Stopping distance is limited by tire grip mostly (assuming ABS control is decent) but sure, believe anything Elon says..."
"To be fair, it's never updated by other manufacturers because it's tested to hell and back before release.  It's considered safety critical firmware.

Tesla apparently did one run and called it good.  I'm exaggerating a bit, but as cool as OTA updates are, it's concerning 1) this was released to the wild in the first place and 2) took virtually no time for a new version of the code to be released"
Apple is not the only company that improves and updates software even years after the hardware is sold.
"Yeah, I've had this a couple of times in software that I've written: it hits a case where the runtime explodes exponentially, and then I figure out how to fix it, so then I can claim I reduced runtime from 20 hours to 20 seconds or something, and people are really impressed.  ;)"
" LOL. Are you referring to the same Apple that throttled its software on older iPhones to force people into upgrading? Yeah, great role model there."
"I upgraded the brake pads on a car with brembro brakes.  The pads were high wear and did great, but the rotors warped after 20,000 miles. I should have upgraded the rotors at the same time.  Lesson learned."
"That could just be because you didn’t break them in properly.  You need to go fairly easy on new brakes till the pads and rotors “wear” into each other.

Also, never go cheap on parts.  There are three levels of parts you can buy.

1. Economy:  These will last about a year and are only good as a placeholder part.  These are very cheap compared to other parts and made from lower quality materials.  Rotor = $25

2. Standard grade:  These are what most shops install when doing repairs.  They are equivalent to what is installed at the factory.  Rotor = $45

3. Super duty/Sport:  These parts are the most expensive and will outlast and outperform stock parts.  In the long run these will serve you best.  Rotor = $65

The prices here are just examples of what prices may be off the top of my head.  I wouldn’t avoid fixing your brakes again.  Just don’t skimp on parts and don’t stomp on the new breaks to see how great they are until they have some time to settle in.

If everything ran well for most of a year your install job was fine.  Good on you for the DIY.

Edit: Fixed incorrect wording.

"I got so much shit on Reddit for telling people that most countries in the EU have laws against working on your own braking system unless you're a licensed technician.

"> Except that one car that exploded if you rear ended it, Ford maybe?

Yes, here's a video of a [Ford Pinto rear impact and explosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZDVqhWGILA).

Many other cars had a poor location for the fuel tank as well, exposed to crashes - such as Grand Cherokee's up to 2004.

ICE vehicle fuel explosions are happening every time on our roads:

- [highway medium-speed crash, instant explosion](https://youtu.be/OeSmeZ5nvWU?t=19)
- [highway medium-speed crash, near instant explosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttOqwVFEIb8)
- [wrong-way driver ICE vehicle explosion](https://youtu.be/UvIhrBFPIBg?t=11)
- [ICE vehicle explosion engulfing a firefighter](https://youtu.be/v1Ld2gW6OfY)

and in higher speed accidents, if there are subsequent gasoline fires, enabled by the explosive air-fuel mixture that is [also used in warfare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmRASCHJe2Q), they are engulfing the whole car very quickly, giving no time for victims to escape.

I.e. while the percentage of gasoline fires in vehicle accidents is comparatively low, *if* they happen they are often explosive in nature.

The commenter above has no idea what he is talking about.

I think it's still broken. It just caused the garage to close on my car as I was backing in. 
"> Update -> BSoD!

Fortunately there's no Windows software in Teslas anywhere that I'm aware of, so no blue screen of death.

So if they crash it's a black screen of death! 😉

They still do that. Last windows update bricked my computer. Had to reinstall the whole thing. Lost 3 days of work doing it. 
"Jesus no wonder the ride is crap. I can’t believe the P100D gets all those records with high tire pressures you wouldn’t get any grip. 
I run my car at 30psi or lower at the track for grip.

Nobody’s ever happy these cars are the pinnacle of technology and you’re upset about some wind noise on their budget vehicle. 🤦‍♂️ not everything is perfect. 
"Yeah, I've worked in QA before.  There's a zero percent chance they found this unless it was purely by accident like it happened in the wild.  This is like a super-specific race condition issue.  You're almost never going to catch it in testing and even reproducing it on purpose can be hard.

"
"Ok, so this issue was found in the field. I still say that they used much more rigorous testing than Tesla does. I've worked with testers before and occasionally they do find issues like this, and often times, at least in the field I was in, it wasn't worth fixing the issues because they were minor, not likely to happen, and easily recoverable. Tesla seems to do only minimal testing on releases, especially on constantly updated things like AP."
If FCA decided to not issue a recall and this publicly known bug happens again and causes injury/death then Chrysler would get sued for millions by surviving family members.
I prefer my news unleaded
It prompts you every time you get in the car though. Most people will take the update quickly. It is not like a phone update that can be easily ignored indefinitely.
You must have me mistaken for Tesla.
"I don't think it was misleading. I read the CR article and they explained what they got for the first test, what they got for subsequent tests, and what Car and Driver got for their tests. They needed to report what they experienced because it's what I could experience with my car when I buy a Tesla. They didn't do anything dishonest and they even confirmed it on a borrowed vehicle the next day to ensure it wasn't a problem with a single car. They explained their test methodology and were transparent with how it's tested.

Now whether other outlets picked it up and oversimplified it or made it dramatic, that's not really within Consumer Reports' control."
"They didn't try to actually run out of battery, they just faked it entirely."
"Did you even actually read CR report?

*""In our testing of the Model 3, the first stop we recorded was significantly shorter \(around 130 feet, similar to Tesla’s findings\), but that distance was not repeated, even after we let the brakes cool overnight. Consumer Reports publishes a distance based on all the stops we record in our test, not just the shortest individual stop.""*

After first shorter 130 ft stop, Model 3 failed to achieve that short stop again.   Even after letting brakes cool overnight.

So after one panic stop, your Model 3 will not stop 130 ft again even next day."
"> Which is why Tesla didn’t catch it. 

And I *bet* Tesla is performing an incredibly hard re-review of their brake testing protocols as we speak ...

"I do have an ear issue, but it also may depend on what you have driven before. We've had 3 Lexuses and they are so quiet, so it makes it even more noticeable."
"From what Elon tweeted, it seems to be an issue with the windshield. He specifically mentioned changing that to reduce aero noise.

For ride comfort, he said to reduce the PSI of the tires."
"This is bs, see for example: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009–11_Toyota_vehicle_recalls#Anti-lock_brake_software_recall"
Agreed. It’s great they fixed it and all but the fanboys in this sub are really overlooking the concerning parts of this story 
"Apple has a reputation for it though. In their markets, they are one of the best in terms of providing support for older products — they still support a 5 year old phone, and at most 9 year old Macs (more often though, 8 years old).

And remember, that’s official support from the manufacturer. Putting Windows 10 on a 10 year old machine doesn’t count unless the system’s OEM is still releasing updated drivers for its internals. "
Name 5
"Maybe you overtightened the wheel lug nuts. It’s a common mistake made by tire shops in a hurry that use an impact wrench to put wheels back on and the first time the rotors get hot they warp under the over-spec force of the over-tightened lugs.
Use a torque wrench to set the torque on the whee lug nuts. Anyone working on a car needs to own a torque wrench."
"Aside from thinned out discs from wear, you can get warping if you leave you foot on the brake when the rotors are hot - the brake pad creates a hot spot and it warps.

If you have to stay stopped after hard braking, put it in neutral and take your foot off the brake."
"Please spell it ""brakes"""
Dude my rotors were like $250 each for a sports sedan. No way you are getting quality rotors for $65
"> most countries in the EU have laws against working on your own braking system unless you're a licensed technician

Which countries?"
"Which countries? I live in the UK and I've never heard of anything like that. 

edit-
Yeah, thought so. Bullshit."
"The procedure is older than time itself. Pop the tires off, spread the calipers, slide out old pads/shoes, bash the rotor until it pops off, reverse with new. Make sure you didn't knick a line or leave anything untightened.

My failing was using Autozone parts that probably effed something."
"Well you got shit because that's 100% not true, it may not be a good idea but it's not illegal to modify your own car. "
"I'm sure sometimes that is true, but in this context the CEO said the company, by name, won't stop until the goal is reached. That is pretty explicit and puts the reputation of both him and the company on the line. Admittedly for fairly small steaks, but it isn't outside the realm of reason to call that a promise. 

Anyway, I was really only attempting to point out to the poster I replied to that if they are going to be pedantic about the vocabulary of the top level post they should at least not be wrong about the definition of the word they are complaining about."
"> If I say I'm going to go to the store tomorrow, and I don't, did I break a promise? Or just change plans?

If you said it to someone with the full intent of influencing their expectations so that they expect you to be there when you said you would be, then yes, you would be breaking a promise to that person."
"Yes, but don't counter him with reason."
"If you say I promise then I agree that is explicitly a promise, but it isn't a requirement. I'm fairy certain most oaths of office don't have the words ""I promise"" in them. The definition I posted clearly states you just need to say ""I will/ will not"" do something."
Yup.

"Not really. It's a response to consumer and market demands. Android is going down the same road for a similar reason.

There are far too many factors at play to be naive and claim that it's simply something they did to themselves."
"Windows and Android are software engineering marvels, either you like them or not."
Hard work. 
"They do this (or at least have in the past, done this) for Autopilot updates. They run the new code in what they call “shadow mode” and the system compares the actions of the driver to the decisions of the AP software. 

They might be running bits of FSD code on current cars in shadow mode as well, which is why they wouldn’t need to report any “autonomous miles driven” to the authorities regulating SDC testing in California. 

They could be doing this for other features as well, but I don’t think there’s been any reports that this is the case. 

There used to be a programme for some drivers living close Palo Alto to sign up for testing early builds of new software after signing an NDA. Not sure if that’s still a thing. We used to get leaks of UI changes from those lot."

For both autocross and road racing, increase tire pressures 6-8 psi from what you would normally run in dry conditions. Hydroplaning occurs when a wedge of water develops between the tire and road surface. 

and from another site

Hoosier tyre pressure recommendations for Dot radials (semi-slick racing tyres):  
2200 – 2600lbs:                                                                 34 – 36  psi  
2600 – 3000lbs:                                                                 36 – 40  psi  
OVER 3000lbs                                                                    40 - 42   psi      

I'll give you a clue that every hybrid and EV on the road that has 4 wheels is over 3000 pounds. The only EVs that aren't are motorcycles.

You must be racing a very light weight vehicle to consider 30 PSI high. And if you keep that mindset driving on the roads when you aren't racing you are severely under inflating your tires and are a danger to others.

Also looking at the fix someone posted of putting some rubber in place where none is a joke to think Tesla didn't see this issue. With that said still getting my model 3 tomorrow.

"> It prompts you every time you get in the car though. Most people will take the update quickly. It is not like a phone update that can be easily ignored indefinitely.

Note that doing it this way also has another benefit, it leaves *some* of the customer exposure risk estimate up to the customer:

- you can skip an update if you know you are leaving for a 2 week vacation and the car won't be used
- you can take an update immediately if you have a Tesla Service Centre nearby and never had any true trouble with updates

I.e. the question to the owner staggers the updates a bit and sorts them by risk, on the time scale of a couple of days - but eventually everyone will update.

We should recognize the advantages of aggressive vertical integration in this particular case: a car company that is a car manufacturer, a car dealership and a car repair shop all in one.

They are doing their best to report this as it stopping in 152ft and doing nothing to correct media that aren't reporting the first stop that was 132ft.

I haven't seen any articles even mention the first stop that was within spec.  They all just claim tesla's take 152ft to stop even though its only a specific emergency stop that triggers the longer subsequent stops."

"I'm not sure that's a fair comparison. As I recall, the Prius brake issue occured under a specific ride scenario that involved braking immediately after hitting a bump or something that would not be readily apparent when testing (I'm sure they test that scenario now).

WAIT. I thought those impact wrenches had torque stops built in! You mean I've been letting people basically guess on my cars for forever?
Thanks.  Good thing to think about.
"Not true at all. It isn’t good to over torque but that wouldn’t cause the rotors to warp after 20,000 miles. Some brake systems are more prone to warping the rotors. Look at Jeep WK... great stoping power but every single one of them will develop warping. Also driving conditions like slamming the brakes when wet can cause pads to not hit evenly. "

It's entirely possible that someone has had the braking issue in the wild.  You'd *never* be able to tell in live driving.  The only reason CR could tell is because it was being measured.  It would be like trying to guess your 1/4 mile trap speed based on feel.  Good luck.
">	Oh yeah, super specific and rare, yet it happened to an actual driver.

Yes, that is how real world scenarios work. Any time you release a product into the wild you're going to get hundreds of bugs found by consumers that you never found in rigorous testing. Sometimes it's because consumers do weird or stupid things. And sometimes it's just because there *are a lot of consumers*. When you have a hundred thousand vehicles on the road and they all go through 1,000+ hours of driving, you are statistically going to get into situations that you could never reasonably test for. You are going to get weird combinations of things. You're going to get things that are half worn down and computers hit with goddamn *cosmic rays*. 

You will never be able to test for everything. In fact you won't even be able to test for most things, statistically. There are just mathematically too many possible combinations out there. 

Tesla got caught by this too. They never noticed the braking issue because their test cars were all calibrated as part of testing. They didn't think that part of their testing *prevented* another part of their testing. 

But I will tell you this. One of these errors required hundreds of thousands of cars and hundreds of thousands of drivers. And one of these errors required a standard battery of vehicle tests. 

It's understandable why tesla didn't catch this in testing. But it's also clear which of the two companies tested more thoroughly. "
">Oh yeah, super specific and rare, yet it happened to an actual driver.

Those statements aren't contradictory.

>So far no actual driver has reported a loss of braking power as seen by CR.

It's not as if drivers are out there with a measuring tape calculating braking distance over multiple attempts.  I can honestly say that in 20 years of driving, I've never had to do a immediate-stop 60-0 brake, and I do plenty of highway driving.

It's worth noting that Car & Driver saw [similar results](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2018-tesla-model-3-in-depth-review-performance-and-driving-impressions-review) in their 70-0 tests:

>The Tesla barely ekes out a win in this category with its stop from 70 mph, although we did notice a bizarre amount of variation in our test, which involves six consecutive panic stops—the third of these stops took an interminable 196 feet.

And a quote in the [Consumer Reports article](https://www.consumerreports.org/hybrids-evs/tesla-model-3-review-falls-short-of-consumer-reports-recommendation/):

>“I’ve been testing cars for 11 years,” Car and Driver Testing Director K.C. Colwell said in an interview with CR, “and in 11 years, no car has stood out with inconsistent braking like this. Some trucks have. . . . It was just weird.”"
"lol. If Tesla has such experts, how did they fail to catch this blindingly obvious flaw?"
I didn't see the video. I'd rather lead with the scary fact than bury it.
It’s not just brakes. Mission critical software in other components have required recalls to be updated for other manufacturers. It’s just not headline news. GM has to do it for air bags. BMW for engines. Etc. 
"The model 3 issue was multiple hard braking events and the model 3 performed within legal parameters just not compared to its class, they improved it by 20 feet and now it is within its class."
"Microsoft doesn’t support Windows 10 on the Surface RT, a device released in 2012. 

That is the equivalent of Apple ceasing support on a Mac, which their oldest is still supported by over 3 additional years. "
"They reduce performance to prevent unexpected shutdowns (which isn’t good) on phones that have degraded batteries as the batteries would be unable to support the usage spikes in certain circumstances below certain percentages. I’m not being specific because it differs based on the level of battery degradation and what the user is doing. 

They also offered extremely cheap battery replacements when that news came to light. Had they said they were doing it from day one, it wouldn’t have been a problem. But because they didn’t, it made it seem like they were hiding something. 

I’ve had my phone for almost two years now with no problems. Treat your electronics like dirt and they’ll pay you back in kind. "
"No, they weren't."
An impact wrench is a wildly uncontrolled method of apply a large torque.
Yeah I remember them about $400-500 per pair for decent ones. They are German brands so that's probably the difference. 
I would not put those on my RS6. 
I won't put a dollar against that.
I’ve seen brake pads put backwards...as in the metal pad backing plate was grinding on the rotors...
"You actually attempted to look it up?  Not all speech is ""promise"" and there's absolutely no way a literate person would make that error, so you're either a liar or illiterate.  If you're not a liar I encourage you to keep reading, it's how you get better."

"Starts at $50K.

But now you are just making up baseless assumptions vs a confirmed report of the cruise control happening in real life.
"lol.  You know there was no case of unintended acceleration in toyotas.  They paid out billions for an issue that didn't exist.  This cruise control issue exists.

This brake issue was only recreated in the lab and not in the real world.  So while it was an issue to fix, no one was affected by it.

In fact, tesla fixed it faster than the months of time consumer reports sat on this knowledge and didn't tell tesla about it.  It makes consumer reports look really bad.

"They didn't lead with a fact, they lied.  By not telling people it was a subsequent stop and not the first time you emergency stop, they lied to people.

They told people tesla's were unsafe, but if you knew you did not emergency brake, you were perfectly fine to keep driving it until you did.

Plus consumer reports sat on this issue.  Had they told tesla immediately, it would have been fixed before CR printed it.

CR put people's lives at risk so they could have time to print and mail out magazines.  Their excuse is basically ""we didn't know tesla could fix it that fast."""
"Well yeah, that device has an incompatible hardware with windows 10. But they still made a special version of windows 8 for those to port over some of the functionalities of win10.

"I already knew what it meant. I posted the exact definition for people like you who think they know what they are talking about. Perhaps you should tone down the high and mighty act though. If you read carefully you will see the words ""will or will not"" in that very definition. Interestingly enough Elon used the word ""won't"" in his sentence, which, if you remember your 2nd grade English, is a contraction of ""will not"". So while you are correct that ""not all speech is 'promise'"", which by the way I never actually claimed at any point, the cited excerpt specifically was because it follows the definition exactly.


So I'll keep on knowing what words actually mean, though perhaps you could work on your reading comprehension and context clues. You are clearly suffering from the Dunning–Kruger effect and projecting your own limitations on me. Bye now."

">This cruise control issue exists.

Yes, absolutely the cruise control issue exists.  And it is apparently incredibly rare.  Incredibly rare things do manifest in the real world at times.  

>So while it was an issue to fix, no one was affected by it.

How do you know that?  Are you saying nobody that drives a Model 3 has had to do a 60-0 full stop, or are you saying everyone that's done so has managed it in the advertised ~133 feet?

The thing about the cruise control failure is that it's completely apparent when it happens.  

Braking distance is a performance metric that's not so inherently apparent.

If you slammed on your car's brakes, would you know how many feet it took to come to a complete stop?  Would you go back and do a measurement?

>In fact, tesla fixed it faster than the months of time consumer reports sat on this knowledge and didn't tell tesla about it. 

When did Consumer Reports perform the test?  How do you know they didn't inform Tesla?  They did publish a quote from an anonymous Tesla spokesperson when they published the article, so clearly they'd spoken at some point."
"> I don’t know why don’t you ask the real “experts” if you think Tesla is such a failure.

Every manufacturer has issues. That is what I originally said,

>> Recalls will still happen with Teslas. Every carmaker deals with mechanical issues. Not much changes there.

What matters is how the manufacturer performs overall in comparison to others, not whether other manufacturers have had recalls or issues before. Obviously, they all have.

Interestingly, as a security measure, **Waymo** shields critical aspects of its features like steering and breaking from outside communication [^1](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4458000-Waymo-Driverless-AV-Application.html). So, updates to critical systems would not be able to be applied OTA."
"Except for they didn't pretend to do it to save the battery. 

They *actually* saved the battery and increased system stability that way. "
"> Unfortunately it's all over the news, 

Tesla isn't the *only* high-tech firm suffering from low quality, click-bait oriented journalism! 😉

Apple messed up the battery saver feature, no argument about that - and they *really* messed up AntennaGate, but the accusation that Apple did it to implement a covert method for planned obsolescence is a hyperbole: it would be a first for Apple, in a long, long time, to intentionally screw their own customers like that.

Regardless of whether we personally like Apple products, it's a fact that similarly to Tesla, Apple has one of the highest consumer satisfaction ratings, and that's very much an integral part of their business model, not just a historical accident of success.

We might be rolling our eyes at some of the more fanboy traits of Apple fans, but, as Yoda would explain, ""treat their customers well Apple does"".

Just consider Microsoft in comparison...

"That's not accurate at all.  My Tesla doesn't need to have the horsepower reduced and it's older than the phones Apple is hobbling on purpose.  Same goes for laptops, non Apple phones, and so on.
