Teslas on Teslas on Teslas
this door is massive!
Anyone know if this is still the one prototype semi or if this is a different one.
this is really awesome! Can't wait to see one!
Matte red?
"Yo, Dawg... I heard you like Teslas...."
"A few more pictures in this link for those who want to see different angles:

I‚Äôm in the Bay Area this weekend and wish I could come across it. At least 200 S3XY models were heading south on my way up from San Diego.
Do anyone know what is being used to charge the Semi now.
How cool!
Tesla SemiS? Multiple? Like the two prototypes or more?
Good size door pockets!
About bloody time.
Does this make anyone else seriously excited for the future?

No way?! My camera will be in my passenger seat at all times
Where in the Bay is this?

Have you seen the news that California has a mandate that by 2024 at least 40% of tractor trailers sold in California must be powered by some form of zero emissions technology.
[deleted]
I've been waiting for this moment. Anyone got a pic with the Teslas on the trailer.
Does anyone know if it will have AP / FSD functionality? I cannot see any hardware from the photo
"~~can you please help me out with the plate number? \[perhaps from the original image\]~~

thanks for [posting originals](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-5Gt0i46IBGy4Wpy0sEwkThtvq2DXJ1X)"
Anyone else notice it doesn‚Äôt have the 63277 MFG plate anymore like all the other cars owned by Tesla? Would this be for commercial trucking reasons?
"What is the purpose/advantage of the suicide doors?

Also, why are they called suicide doors?"
That was the same semi in the pride rally last year. Good to see it's making it's rounds.
Been waiting to see this on the road
Cant wait to see Tesla semi's delivering SpaceX rocket components and boosters to Cape Canaveral
Tesla on tesla crime
"I'll get a Tesla one day, I'm hoping that when out 2018 Chevy Cruze is paid off in 2022 we might be able to use it as a trade in towards a Model 3 (or whatever the best value model is when that time comes) We'll never be able to afford a S,X or Y (Teslas are sexy üòÜ) but a Model 3 is indeed within our means (financed obviously)"
Me trying to find a reason to by a Semi.
That's so cool! I love how Tesla get their products out and into real-world environments so quickly. Other companies seem to have their tech in lab for waaay too long; wasting a lot of time not gathering value information from real-world usage.
Isn't it crazy that tesla is the most valueable car manufacturer in the world and only has 4 live models.
So freakin awesome!
don't make word's plural with apostrophe's
now that is meta!
The front looks like a tram
Optimus Prime would tap that
I love Tesla but that truck scares me
"If Tesla was a verb you could say the following.

Tesla tesla‚Äôing teslas with Tesla."
They look like that toy truck everyone had as a kid.
So S3XY.
Yo dawg I heard you like Tesla so I put Teslas on a Tesla to deliver your Teslas.
teslainception
"Idk why but this pic reminds me of the self driving truck that delivers robots in the movie I, Robot"
This is great to see.... Can't wait till they are all over the world...
So cool!!!!
yo dawg I heard u like teslas
Big if true.
Anyone know why Tesla seems to have given up on the aero covers for the back wheels and the aero hubcaps?
"Is the steering wheel n the middle of the cab like it was in the prototype, or did they move it to the left?  Hard to tell.........."
Score one for the good guys. Suck it Trevor
This is really cool
About time
These jawns got suicide doors?!
Tram at Disneyland inspire Elon‚Äôs design of the  Semi?
The number of people in this thread putting an apostrophe in 'Semis' is disappointing.
Why does it look so *soft*...
Is this the same one that /u/Westy543 took just a couple hours before?
Ok that just looks hilarious! Looks like a toy.
I just saw one of those the other day carrying 4 Ford F-150s. I was conflicted to say the least.
"Breaking news, new Tesla semi gives citizens a semi, work cancelled."
Is it driving itself on the road without a human onboard?
"*semis

An apostrophe means possessive or conjunction."
"I was thinking it's unlikely to win any style awards (it's a fugly bastard), but not only that, now I find out it has suicide doors as well?"
 ‚ÄúBut... but... a clean greenhouse free machine is delivering greenhouse free cars?!?! BILLIONAIRES SHOULDNT EXIST!!!‚Äù
Why did you flip the photo
Ur driving a fucketh tesla
Jeez even the panel gaps on semis are bad
For reals ? Not a lot of cars on that trailer
So that huge door is going to get in the way. Extra work when hooking and unhooking the trailer.
Wait for the analysts and experts to say ‚ÄúThey are not semi‚Äôs. Tesla semi‚Äôs don‚Äôt exist. They are scaled up Model X
some one dub a rap song
Xzibit is that you?

That would be an ATV on a Cybertruck on a Semi

I heard you like Tesla
Hey Alexa
"Yea, like big 3 used to, Mercedes, and Volvo"
It's more like a walk in like a bus than a step up and over the fuel tanks on a traditional semi
"I didnt realize they open backwards. That's odd.

Not sure that it matters though either."
Wonder if it has the automated open/closing functionality like the X.
Suicide doors?  Blech!
"There's two prototype Semi's. There's [the Silver one](https://i1.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/06/semi_bridge_3840x2160-e1528139965139.jpg?w=2500&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1), which is the bigger one. Then there's the red one, which [originally used to be black](https://i2.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/Tesla-Semi-black-prototype.jpg?w=2500&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1) but then got wrapped to red. As you can see in the picture, the red one is currently being used for deliveries. 

[Here's a side-by-side](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0173/8204/7844/articles/tesla-semi-secret-weapon_1600x.jpeg?v=1587498078) to show the difference in size."
Asking the important questions!
Would love to see a matte color series for the 3 üòÆ
Yep! Like a matte red with matte black emblems/logos/handles. Not sure if it‚Äôs a wrap or paint though
I put some teslas on your Tesla so you can Tesla while you Tesla!
"I'm really looking forward to these being standard trucks on the road. I have a CDL and think the quality of life in an electric truck will be so much better without the loud diesel engine and accompanying rumble, plus the uphill and takeoff speed, and generally cheaper operating cost. But shit, those doors are STOOPID. I can see in your pics the road water/rain that is sweeping in along their front, plus trying to get out to deal with the trailer and other things in the back will take longer and on the side of the road will put the driver in danger trying to walk around or open that up all the way to get out. I hope they change that design to a regular opening door and that there is an option for the bioweapon defense mode for drivers hauling hazardous cargo. Good pics!"
Should have stopped by the museum in LA for cybrtrk. Was glorious to see in person!
"Last I saw, a cable that connects to four supercharger stalls simultaneously. Quad Channel Charging!"
"It would, but I'm not sure savings will actually materialize for us. If there were no more (or just far less) truck drivers, prices would necessarily go down. But I'm guessing we won't see much of that money in terms of savings. It'll be real nice not having to listen to that loud ass, old turd ICE that those trucks normally have in them. That's going to be pretty darn cool. And dramatically cutting our dependence on oil is also really cool. But what I'd really like to see is a big cut in the price of all goods that are delivered by truck. Which is nearly all goods."
Burlingame
"You will need a truck driver for a long time because of what you said, and for safety issues that may arise on trucks. For example installing chains, mechanical issues that arise on trucks etc."
"There is no production modem truck that is ""practically self driving."" At most they have FCAM and adaptive cruise."
I believe that we will have convoys and that the size of these will eventually increase to the point where a human is controlling 1000:s of trucks.
Have to automate the loading/unloading and trailer operation. Drivers open the doors and deal with all the paperwork. I think a lot could be done with autonomous highway drivers and the 'drone piloting' the truck in cities or if an emergency is registered. But expensive trailers that open themselves is another issue.
"There was a video of a Semi with no driver in it. Not sure if it was the driver being out of sight, or me just being blind"
https://twitter.com/teslaownersSV/status/1276596607635488771?s=20
"Yes it will include both. It has two screens, one on each side of the driver; one is for road/AP visualization while the other is for settings and all that"
What for?
"main advantage is cost. it takes less time and effort to design a door with hinges on straight vertical line, instead of aerodynamic shape if they were other way around."
"Because of the door didn‚Äôt get shit and popped open or if you got out why the car was still
Moving it caught you and you got ran over."
name other car manufacturer that have electric vehicle fleet of 4 models and can sell in major markets at a decent profit for decent price and don't have assets that are going to cost 10s of billions to liquidate in near future.
auto-incorrect often help's me en'sure posts' will be different than I expect because wheres the fun in simply replaying what the typi'st enter's
It‚Äôs centered with a screen on each side of it. Look in the comments of this post for a link I put to a few more pics I took
Looks like it to me. That trailer seems familiar. I'm curious where this one was taken though.
"I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave."
Of course.
I didn‚Äôt? I‚Äôm sitting in a Tesla the screens on my right side as it should be lmao
Look at the car window picture was taken from the letters are not flipped.
Because they were delivered!

"I'm surprised Teslas haven't found their way into rap songs yet

It's more like a cabover. They normally have a nice low step at the front.
"Called suicide doors back in the 60's/70's. ~~If they opened while driving, would suck you out of the car.~~

\*Edit My history was wrong. The explanations I found for the name:

>Rear-hinged doors earned its nickname ""suicide doors"" from many of its design flaws that could injure or even kill the occupant. The doors, when open, had a high chance to seriously injure anyone exiting or entering the offside of the car door if its hit by a passing vehicle. Suicide doors were also very prevalent during the time where seat belts weren't as common, so the chances of falling out while opening up a rear-hinged door were greater.  
>  
>If a rear-hinged door gets hit by a vehicle, then the door will hit the passenger, causing serious injury, unlike a front-hinged door where the door swings forward, reducing possible passenger injury. Aerodynamic forces could also potentially force a rear-hinged door to open while moving if the door isn't closed properly. The Subaru 360 had that problem in 1969, based on a report done by Consumer Reports.  
>  
>People who open rear suicide doors by themselves also have a huge risk of hitting a pedestrian or a bystander standing behind the door if the occupant is unaware of their surroundings. But hey, opening a door that opens outwards in the rear direction is very impractical, and owners of cars with suicide doors have a chauffeur to do it for them anyways.  
>  
>Car companies addressed these hazards by implementing safety features such as seat belt and locks in order to reduce the risks of falling out of a car with suicide doors. The risks of getting hit by a suicide door slamming into you by another car or hitting a pedestrian standing behind the door is still pretty high though."
Maybe to avoid Nikolas silly patent?
"They will be a pain in the ass for drivers, especially getting out on the shoulder. You can see in the OPs photos that water is streaking in from the front, damn near filling the door pocket. Makes the in/out process and checking everything in the back take more time, which for truckers, is their money."
center positioned steering wheel is pretty lame too
When you say bigger: I can see the silver one is much higher (possibly nothing but streamlining for higher loads). Does the silver one have a larger chassis?
The silver one isn't bigger aside from the roof fairing.  Which adds no size besides height.
The chassis are identical the only difference is the height. One is equipped with taller roof fairings to match a normal 53‚Äô straight frame. The shorter roof fairing is normally for applications where the trailer size varies more. They are likely testing both configurations to see if there is a measurable difference. If not - shorter is always better for a commercial vehicle.
How do you know they didn‚Äôt make a second red one?
I heard it got wrapped cuz it caught on fire.
I think it's just a wrap.
It‚Äôs a wrap
I was just thinking if it would be better to have the doors on a rail that slides back along the body instead?
Aren't they center drive? Why would you get out on the road side in that scenario?
Wouldn't it actually be safer to get out have the door as a shield and walk around the front to the right side.
"I don't doubt what you're saying but I really wanna see what it looks like, do you have a link?"
That‚Äôs actually a really good perspective I haven‚Äôt seen

"> Drivers open the doors and deal with all the paperwork.

Just change the way seals and signatures work and now it's the loaders/unloaders who are responsible for stock."
Thanks. This is awesome.

"some automotive parts cataloging will allow you to search by license plate number. 

The Secretary of State apparently sells LPN -> VIN number data (although I believe the VIN numbers are missing the last few digits so it's only the vehicle make/model info).

It might only work for Light truck/cars (not semi-trucks / recreational vehicles) as I was unable to reverse search any info about this LPN \[CA XP24262\]."

There's is a swedish rap song literally Just called Tesla.

There is also a popular Italian song about Teslas named 'Tesla'
"Listen to some Tyler, the Creator. Specifically ‚Äú911/Mr. Lonely‚Äù."
Cubertruck and quad were on a music video!!!
Maybe in Europe (though to be honest I think they‚Äôre still steps hanging down under the door not inside it) but most of the time in the states cabovers you have to blob the steps behind the door and then sidestep over the tire to where the door is. Quite the climb!
"Wouldn't it draw air into the car, not suck you out? I thought it was more because if you fell out you could be dragged by the door."
"... on doors?

That seems unlikely."
Found the non car people.
Found the non semi truck drivers. My dad drove a cab-over-engine freightliner for 18 years. He loves the look of the setup (minus the no daybed part...again he's old school).
"In the pic above - it looks like the Silver one either has a larger sleeper cab or side fairing as well. Note that black thingy at the top - on the red one its right at the end, on the silver one there is more behind it."
It's a wrap on the [original black one](https://i2.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/Tesla-Semi-black-prototype.jpg?w=2500&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1) that was at the unveil.
That sounds even better if they don't want standard doors. Like a van door.
"Maybe a tire blew out on the driver side. Maybe there's something dangling from there, maybe you need some equipment that's behind the cab on that side, most air connections are on the left side so any time you connect to a trailer it'd be on the left side (might have to drop the trailer if the truck has problems and another driver had to ferry it the rest of the way), truck stop waiting spaces are really narrow which would make that honker of a door hard to get in and out of plus it shoves you infront of the cab, let alone all the regular dangers of suicide doors. Could be a guard shack you have to get out and deal with paperwork and walk the guard to the trailer door to show that the seal is intact. They're be on the left side, center of the road. (In America, not sure about Europe and other spots) really it's dealing with the air connections that makes this design a pain in the ass, constantly hopping in and out to check and fix something, the disconnect methods usually require the driver to disconnect the two air lines and electric connection, disengage the kingpin lock, and lower the landing gear of the trailer so it can stand on it's own, plus letting the air out of the drive axles so that the next driver can hookup and they lift the landing gear slightly so it's not so hard to roll the gear back up.  But that's all on the left side, usually.

Edit: I think the biggest issues with this door design is dealing with hooking and dropping trailers, especially for local drivers (since the range isn't 1000+ miles for long haul) and grocery stores are the big buyers so they'll be shuffling trailers around their warehouses often during the day. Maybe Tesla's will have an interesting digital kingpin operation but they HAVE to be checked manually to make sure the trailer isn't dumped onto the ground when taking off. Back up to the trailer, ensure alignment and proper height (might have to get out and lower the trailer so it hooks up correctly) back all the way under to hook up, get out check, if it's not right than back in the truck to realign, get out check, connect air and electrical connections, raise the landing gear, get back in, and leave. Lots of in/out when hooking and dropping, often in tight spaces in trailer lines."
"A shield? Against what, a highway speed impact? It'll slam on you and turn you into paste haha."
"I see what you're saying, but I don't think most drivers would appreciate that, especially if they need to do something on the driver's side. Keep in mind that the majority of drivers are old and have mobility problems."
They still are limited to only driving so many hours per day so they would still need to park/trade off with their partner.
"Those warehouse people have a lot to do already and aren't paid great. Paid ok, but not great.  It would have to be automated but then the driving company can't verify they load until they unload and someone looks at what's in the back."

What 1950s truck are you talking about?   That's not how any modern trucks are
"Actually it's more because if you open it carelessly and a car comes from behind and hits the door, it's gonna slam closed and send your body parts flying if you were exiting the car. Whereas with normal doors, it'll rip off the door and not much else."
I believe it was because the door would fly open and if you held on to it you would be dragged out of the car.
"Apparently their patent fight was partially about how the door is behind the driver. Heard on TeslaDaily interview with their CEO, IIRC."
They are moveable side fairings - they flare out when the truck turns so they don‚Äôt get damaged by the trailer.
Good call more ferrings for sure.    You can see them better in the individual picture.
I heard SS Customs in Redwood City did a lot of Tesla‚Äôs wraps.  At least that is what they claimed when I got my ceramic coat
"That would be changed at the same time full autonomous driving was legalized. 

I would imagine the first place where it would be legal would be in desolate, open road areas of the country."
Are the ziplock ties with serial numbers there specifically to prevent the driver having a look in the back?

"I should have left my American bubble and specified American trucks.  This is what we have over here. 

https://www.truckpaper.com/listings/trucks/for-sale/list/category/211/heavy-duty-trucks-conventional-day-cab-trucks/manufacturer/peterbilt/model-group/379

The only reason the cab overs were used here was to usurp lengthy limits on trucks, but those laws were changed long enough ago that there aren't really many cabovers left on the road.
To be fair though, I was also incorrectly considering the trucks I linked as cabovers, when they technically aren't, but they are what replaced them."

"Because they‚Äôre actually way better.

Europe places overall length restrictions on tractor-trailers which is why cab-over trucks are common there. Shortening up the length of the tractor unit means getting to lengthen the trailer and thus haul more goods. Additionally they tend to do better with navigating Europe‚Äôs tighter roads.

In the US we just have trailer length restrictions, there are no length restrictions for the tractor part. So there‚Äôs no reason to try to shorten them, thus we use conventional trucks as they are more aerodynamic and easier to perform maintenance on."
i would assume safety but I'm sure there's more to it than that.
Pretty sure its easier and cheaper maintance and repairs of the engine. Could even be more areodynamic. EU has length laws and thats why the front is so flat.
Thanks. That front nose of US trucks is super big. The view for the drivers must be terrible.
Makes sense. I didn‚Äôt know there is a length restriction for european trucks. Thank you for your insight. It‚Äôs actually weird how they able to squeeze all the engine and stuff and the cab while having roughly the same height as the american trucks
All those videos you see of this type of truck eating cars driven by idiots too dumb to get out of the blind spots.
"Well that‚Äôs becuase American trucks increase their height for aerodynamics. The top portion of the truck above the driver is usually just plastic fairings so that air isn‚Äôt slamming into the broadside of the front of trailer.

You can kind of see it in this picture where truck cab stops and then theres a fairing bolted onto the roof.

"Yeah. Or simply build trucks which basically don‚Äôt have a blind spot anymore, like in Europe. It‚Äôs not nice to hang around in the ‚Äúblind spot‚Äú but still a driver‚Äòs responsibility to not change lanes into someone else. Also in citys there‚Äôs a lot more to look for than just cars."
"I hope this ends up on the desk and social media and email  of the VP of Customer Experience  (or whatever title they use). This is the perfect test case for the company to use for massive improvements.  If they want to excel at everything,  they need to excel here perhaps the most."
"Thank you for sharing. It‚Äôs really baffling to me how a company the size of Tesla hasn‚Äôt figured out how to set up a customer service call center. I shudder every time I try to reach them. Some report success using the chat feature on the Web site, but that option is positively buried and you have to go through a bunch of hoops to get to it. It‚Äôs amazingly poor support for such an expensive purchase. I‚Äôve had better support for $20 gizmos than for a $60k car. Long-term, this is not good for the brand."
I can‚Äôt blame you for returning it. Not a good look to put a brand new customer through all of that.
"I refused my Y at delivery just about 10 days ago. It was in such physical disarray, I was embarrassed for them...and they didn‚Äôt seem to notice or care. 

Scratched paint (to the metal), paint chipped off the bumper, almost every panel misaligned, front sensor pushed in. 

I first walked up to the car thinking the driver door was ajar, nope just so badly misaligned!  The only thing I bothered to look at was the dirt on the driver seat. I didn‚Äôt look at any more. 

Needless to say, I wasn‚Äôt happy the service center a) didn‚Äôt notice and b) didn‚Äôt really seem to care c) tried to use touch up paint to try and deliver the car to me. 

Just got notification my replacement is on its way, to a different service center...maybe they‚Äôll care about its condition. If I have to refuse delivery again, it may be their last shot with me. Or I‚Äôll wait for the cyber truck, maybe they‚Äôll have their shit together by then.

They‚Äôre trying to compete with the luxury brands but the technology won‚Äôt cut it if you piss everyone off with lack of customer service and QUALITY BEFORE DELIVERY!!!"
"It's really sad to read such story. But you did it right. Tesla screwed, unfortunately once again.

I hope they can earn your trust again in the future."
Welp hope the 250 miles was fun.
"I think Tesla customer service in the past did a very good job with *most* S and X owners.  I‚Äôve always had great luck.  I‚Äôve been treated well, but not nearly as well as my MB dealer used to treat me.  My perception is they haven‚Äôt developed the CS team along with their growth with 3 and Y, so now they are not able to handle the higher load.  

Email and app based support are fine for a startup, but not for a major auto manufacturer."

Stories like this are why I can‚Äôt bring myself to pull the trigger on a Tesla.  My buddy has a Model 3 and has had no problems.  But others here (Los Angeles) I have spoken to often have stories that give me pause.
I've had issues with tesla and this sounds about right. There's like no one to speak to over there. It's very hard to get ahold of someone that actually knows what they're talking about.

I don't fault you at all. Great post and share. Have loved my 3 but I've had nothing but great service.   Incredibly annoying service and your return sucks for you but hopefully flags attention at corporate of this continued lack of customer focused service. I hope someday you join the family but don't fault you if you don't.
good move. I'd be livid if that happened to me.
"The rare but occasional testimonials like these are one of the main reasons I am still very hesitant to purchase a Tesla. Excellent customer service is near the top of my priority list for important purchases in my life, and with a vehicle usually being the second most expensive thing the average person purchases, customer service and experience is very important. I know they are a growing company and still have a lot of room for improvement, but the idea of having to wait months for a repair on a vehicle or having to jump through so many hoops to talk to a human is pretty off-putting for now. I love their innovation and who they are as a company, but I think they still need a lot of work on these areas to earn my business in the future."
"You did the right thing. It's not a popular stance on this sub, but I regret not returning my model 3.

I had similar issues with manufacturing defects that required me to take the car in for work before I could really drive it, when I was stuck out of town. I had similarly negative customer service interactions as well and talked to my service center about returning the car potentially and their response was aggressive and accusatory. Ultimately I loved the car too much to pull the trigger on returning it, but I regret that now. Tesla's customer service is about as bad as it gets, and I have had regular issues with them, none of which have ever been resolved satisfactorily.

I could write out my whole story if issues if people want, but it's pretty long"
"Thankyou for sharing your story - and for following through on the refund.

I know it sucks, clearly you were excited to have the vehicle, but the only way people in managerial positions will care about customer experience is if customers vote with their wallets.

This is one of the reasons why I can't wait until Tesla has viable rivals. As soon as there are more options with comparable appeal, Tesla will really need to up their service game to stay desirable - and that's going to benefit all of us."
"It‚Äôs sad that there such a wide range of service quality and that it seems to depend so much on each Service Center... My only issue has been with purchasing itself where it was so difficult to get answers and a smooth transaction: I wasn‚Äôt buying a fridge, I was buying a 90k$CA car! Probably one, if not THE most expensive purchase that I‚Äôll ever do in my live besides a house...

The good thing about Tesla is that their cars are so great that you‚Äôll forget these issues so quickly once you get back in the car and maintenance is low that you might not hear about their service for the next years! ;) It‚Äôs unfortunate that you didn‚Äôt keep the car but those situations are so stressful that it‚Äôs understandable."
"They won‚Äôt get ironed out.  This behavior goes back to the pre-Model X days.  Some local locations are better than others.

Tesla is a brand that is a great vehicle if it works.  If there a significant breakdown, well, you quickly see what happens where a tech company culture is brought to the car world.

The percentage of lemons may be low, but they exist."
"If Tesla handled customer service like Amazon or AMEX they would rule the damn world!

Once others catch up to their product there is nothing keeping me loyal to Tesla all because of their shit customer service."
Elon just HAS to figure this out. If you‚Äôre the best selling car in a market (California for example) you have to scale your service and support to match.
"To be honest, this is my biggest issue with Tesla, and they really need to put some serious effort into this kind of crap.

My brother tried to buy a Model 3, and got as far as showing up to pick up the car and Tesla pretty much fucked up the whole thing enough that he just canceled the car and went out and bought a Leaf.

I had my own issues trying to get my car a while ago. A lackluster experience to be sure. My first interactions with Tesla service was also subpar.

The car is 9/10, but dealing with tesla is a 4/10."
"Biggest reason I will not get a Tesla is how they don't seem to give a flying f**k about service when that is a huge part of owning a car.

People let Tesla get away with so much BS 

Only way they will learn is to not take their BS"
"We all need GM,VW, Hyundai to succeed in electrics as without this we are doomed to horrible Tesla service"
"Not surprised. Getting my Model 3 turned from being super exciting to a pain in the ass, with numerous service visits (1 hr away) for unpainted sections of the car, minor scratches, and mostly paint issues. Oh and some fit issues on the interior trim as well as trunk."
"I‚Äôm an owner since 2012 and you did the right thing. Sorry this was your experience, but your concern was completely founded and valid."
"Good. They need to get better, and this is the only way to do it, unfortunately."
Anyone tweet this to Elon yet?
Did they charge you a delivery fee for the privilege to drive 500 miles to pick it up and stay in a hotel?
"This is such a lose lose situation. 

Tesla should‚Äôve covered the warranty and it sounds like Tesla corporate would have but a manager with too much of ego wouldn‚Äôt get out of the way. 

Now, a good customer loses a car and Tesla will be forced to sell this car at a discount. Everyone loses because they couldn‚Äôt just do the right thing."
"Was this the Kansas star casino near Wichita, cause pretty sure my buddy saw you haha."
Thanks for sharing. This kind of crap really scares me. Almost sounds like it‚Äôs made up (I realize you‚Äôre not making this up).
I just checked and they don‚Äôt even *have* a service place in Montana.  I‚Äôm eventually moving to Shelby MT... how the fucking hell am I supposed to get service?
Is Tesla pretty picky about the warranty? Any other car and I would just tighten up the bolts real quick and be on my way.
Super unfortunate. There should be no question whether or not the tow would be covered on a fresh vehicle like that. Did Tesla provide the towing company?
"I almost returned my M3 a few days after delivery. I love this car, for a lot of reasons, but Tesla has some serious work to do in the quality control department. I had multiple interior parts with damage, and a paint job they should be ashamed to allow out of the factory. After A LOT of arguing, they replaced the interior panels, twice, because some of the first replacement parts also came damaged... which they installed anyway and tried to return it to me.

The paint job is still REALLY BAD, but I‚Äôm legitimately afraid they‚Äôd do more harm than good. I‚Äôm not entirely sure if I can keep the car long term, the paint is so thin and uneven. I live in a salt and snow region, so rust will come early on this car.

I finally had one service center manager (who turns out, I used to work with) be honest with me, and tell me that Tesla paint work isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôd expect like from other luxury brands. He said he‚Äôd gotten a lot of complaints recently on inclusions, uneven paint, and weird clear coat issues. I have all of those all over my M3, so I have no reason to doubt him."
"It sucks you and so many others have had a poor experience like this. I think the main issue is that Tesla Service has never adapted to being a mass car producer.

When Tesla only sold the Model S they provided fantastic service. I worked in sales at a sales and service centre. The last quarter before Model 3 we sold 112 Model S/Model X. In one month we sold  over 300 Model 3s alone. This massive ramp up saw us hire and train 5 new sales people, 12 new delivery associates while our service department increased by only one service advisor and actually had two less mechanics by the time I left. Even if your service advisor wanted to do a good job they were worked to the bone. Naturally they started leaving so you had attrition of the best people.

I left almost two years ago. I get the impression from talking to my old customers it hasn't gotten any better and having two large volume vehicles with the Model Y has made it even worse according to the one person I still know in the service department since everyone else left."
Totally understand the frustration. We were rear-ended at about 65mph (we were stopped for traffic) in our AWD Model 3. The wreck put my wife in the hospital and bent the frame of the Tesla. Her no name insurance company had never dealt with a Tesla before so that was a challenge on its own. But the closest place around to work on the car was 6 hours away.  Insurance refused to total it by just a few thousand dollars and we only had the car for 2 months and 20 days.   We had to go to that repair shop 4 separate times over the course of 2 month because everytime we went they missed something or it didn't drive right or the center console wasnt installed correctly.   Needless to say we sold it and now have a very bitter experience with Tesla. I'll own one again someday. But their service HAS to get better.
"Great company horrible customer service..I have had Similar issues with their customer service the only reason people even put up with this non sense either they believe in Elon‚Äôs cause , love the car or just delusional.."
"I dealt with the same horrible customer service.  Last minute delivery cancellations, missing car, wrong car, broken display, warped taillights, broken window motor, no followup, no appreciation, no communication at all, 4 hour wait at the service center, extremely rushed delivery process, paint defects.  With all that, hate the entire experience dealing with Tesla employees, but I do love my Model 3.  They know the purchase and service processes are horrendous and have been for several years but they do not care to fix it. Also expecting to suffer the same price with my cybertruck. I may read some self help, meditation, anger mgt books to mentally prepare..."
"I understand how you feel 100%. My Model 3 has been in service three times for a leaky trunk (rain getting in). Service center has proven themselves to be completely incompetent at fixing it. One time they got it sealed, but moved the trunk door down so much that it sat on the rear bumper, causing paint scratches. I complained and they corrected the trunk position. Guess what, now it‚Äòs leaky again. 

Appointments by app only, no way to plead urgency, they just make me drive around with a towel in my trunk. Glad to have the Weathertech mat in there or my carpet would be soaked by now."
Yes Tesla's customer service is horrible. I have had the car over 6 months now with expired temp tags because Tesla collected the wrong amount of taxes from me for my state and I'm STILL waiting on them to rectify the issue with the DMV.
"Tesla is a design company. They still haven‚Äôt figured out how to be a car company. 

Posts like this thankfully keep me from pulling the trigger yet. Their customer service approach is a joke."
Just popping in to say Tesla Customer service is one of the worst experiences I had.
"When people say ""Tesla is a software company"", I guess Tesla corporate is following the software company support style as well. I like Tesla and plan to get one once my current lease is up (doing a 3 year ICE lease 7 months ago was a mistake...), but it would definitely be frustrating dealing with something like that mixed with corporate/service center miscommunication and delays."
"That sucks. I hope you‚Äôre able to get a different Tesla in the future, maybe from a different service center. Unfortunately their customer service is wildly inconsistent."
"Tesla's customer serice can be so weak that my fleet car company specifically emailed me to warn about it and point out that I could be without a car for extended periods if things go wrong... I've never had that from them with any other brand

I agree with the other commenter that this is where Tesla really needs to excel: my Model 3 has been fine so far, but the kind of experience OP has had is the sort of thing that gets a brand a bad reputation that takes decades to shift: Decades Tesla doesn't have

The real concern here isn't the failure: things break, when you make a million cars it's inevitable that a few will have minor issues... the problem is that it wasn't deal tiwht in a reassuring manner or with any alacrity."
"That's Tesla. Great design, hit or miss manufacturing, and shoddy customer service."
"Former Tesla employee here. This isn‚Äôt a one off, Tesla just doesn‚Äôt give a single fuck about you the consumer. The customer service is atrocious and it is 100% true that the only communication we had was between email or teams, no real working department phone numbers. If we needed to get in touch with another department over the phone we had to dial them just like you do. This is done on purpose to discourage people from complaining btw.
The guy telling you the management wouldn‚Äôt budge was a total piece of shit and lying his ass off. If you escalate enough you can get shit done but Tesla tells their employees to deflect over and over as much as they can."
"I guess I‚Äôll share my bad customer service experience here. 
Approx 3 weeks ago I booked a service appointment through the Tesla app to have my wall connector fixed, as the button that you press to open the charge port is broken. 
I received a message 2 days later requesting more information about the charger, what make and model etc. They asked me to test opening the charge port with something else, i.e. a supercharger cable. I tested it with the mobile connector that came with the car and it worked fine.
I know for a fact it is just the button on the wall connector cable that doesn‚Äôt work. 
There was no further communication after that and my appointment still showed in the app, so I assumed I would receive a visit from a technician on my set date, which was Monday 8th June. 
About 2 weeks pass by and I‚Äôve swapped my shifts at work to make sure I have the day off and to make sure I‚Äôm home for the 2 hour service slot in the middle of the day. 
The morning of the appointment, I check the app to see if I have received an update, which it says you may get if you have a service booked and should leave for the technician. It‚Äôs then that I notice the scheduled appointment has disappeared from the service tab in the Tesla app. 
After a quick call to my nearest service centre, I am offered sincerest apologies and am told by the person who has answered the call that my appointment was cancelled, but she doesn‚Äôt know why. Apparently it is ‚Äústill a technician‚Äôs note.‚Äù 
A couple of hours later I received a text message asking me to take a video highlighting the problem. I oblige, email the video over and text them to confirm that I have sent the video. 
Two days later and it‚Äôs radio silence from them again. 
It‚Äôs a real shame that the company making some of the best cars available on the market still won‚Äôt fund their customer service program properly. The cyber trucks, roadsters and semis should all be put on the back burner until they have a proper way of dealing with customers who are having issues with their products. 
I was torn between a Mercedes and a Tesla when I opted for my M3P. Part of me wishes I would have stuck with an ICE for a few more years until Tesla was really ready for my custom."
"I pick up my MY tomorrow, but I've gotten vibes just from the sales and test drive processes that the actual people/service side of the business will be a challenge. My take is it's mostly just a corporate arrogance. They have unique system that is mostly pretty well executed on line. However they seem to lack the basic relationship skills to address things that you can't just click buttons to solve.

This feels mostly like a by product of so much leadership coming out of silicon Valley. That industry believes they can program their way to success, sometimes true, but a car is a pretty high touch experience, in a touch less time.

I'll take a touch less delivery tomorrow, and so far no one has even shown me how to make my car fart. How is that possible? Should be the first thing a salesperson shows you.

I think Tesla will figure some of this out. I just, think they believe they don't have to do any of that archaic human contact, appease a customer stuff."
"Also experienced outright deception and lies from Tesla, they really do have terrible customer service which is sad because there are some great people working under a bad system. 

My wife was telling me to return my Model 3 after a string of deception and lies about its condition during pick up and then outright personal attacks by their staff. I decided to keep it in the end and don‚Äôt regret it, but they have a lot of room for improvement."
"I'll probably never be able to afford a Tesla but if I did, I would expect as much as you did.  I would expect top notch service.  There's nothing high tech about proper customer service.  It would have turned me off just like it did you."
"2 years later nothing changed. My delivery experience was absolutely nerve wracking. My ISA ghosted me 4 days before delivery, no human reachable on the customer service line. After the delivery I got the quality assurance call from Tesla and I told them the hoops I had to jump through to get my car sorted out. The guy was so impressed he offered me a job and it got me thinking, is this their recruiting process? If you can get your car delivered you get a job offer?"
">They don't have a number to call someone about it.

holy fuck this is ridiculous. 

I will not consider a Tesla until their service network and experience improves."
"I don't blame you one bit.

I love my car, but there is no way whatsoever I would put up with that situation."
"Tesla rushed production and this happens. there are a handful of foaming issues with this model as well, check sandy review from YouTube. This foaming issues make the car sound noisier on the road. As for the customer service, The way the CS handle things definitely turn me off. Toyota offered me a better service than this."
"Unfortunate to see these things happen even after scaling volumes with the 3. One can give them the benefit of doubt the first go, but such quality issues persisting with a new product line after 2 years of learning is pretty disappointing.

It's even more disheartening that they know things like this happen and are turning a blind eye to it at the corporate level. Until early 2019, there used to be an Executive escalation option in the Tesla account, and they removed that option for support. At this point, a complete overhaul for customer service is necessary and crucial"
"I've owned Tesla's for 5 years now and service has definitely gone down hill. There used to be stupid oversights but they'd do what they could to make it better. Now they couldn't care less. I'm reminded of all the crap I went through when I got my P3D+ a couple years ago. I still love the car but it took me so long to get the issues worked out. Eventually gave up on getting paint issues fixed.

Just ordered a Model Y last night but woke up this morning to see you can use referral codes now. Called to see if I could get that ordered and they said I'd have to cancel the order and lose my 100 dollars and order again. In the past it was easy to get a referral added. Leaning strongly towards cancelling at this point."
"you did the right thing! if the cannot support a customer who has just bought the car, god know what will happen few years down the line!!"
"Hang in there. I've had bad experiences as well and they don't all get resolved. It's so frustrating that I also just wanted to drop the car off and tell them to keep it. The cars are great, but the service is a joke.

My Model 3 was delivered with ""assembly required"". Later down the line I found that I was missing parts of the underbody aero. I suspect that either they were not installed at the factory, not reinstalled during service, or someone snuck under my car at the grocery store and disassembled the underbody. Most likely a service visit omission.

I could very well also write a post as long as yours, but I get upset and Tesla doesn't care so it's a wasted effort."
"> I also find out the long delays are because all of this is being done by email... They don't have a number to call someone about it. That seems like an impossible way to get anything done in a timely manner, but that what I was told...

That's the moment at which I would have said ""I'm done. These are all **your** problems, and I'm not going to be stuck in your mess."" I'm glad that you had the same reaction and at the same point I would. 

It's great to love the car and the company, but fall out of live with the reality of their screwup. They screwed up a few times there - it happens, you understand that it happens, and you have every right to report and publicize your bad experience. 

And you're far from the only one who has difficulties getting through to humans at Tesla. To be faaaaiiir, it's hard to get ahold of humans at Ford, Mercedes, GM, Toyota, etc corporate too (that's specifically what they have their dealers for), but Tesla's direct sales model makes it imperative that at least the sales force can talk with corporate efficiently."
"I‚Äôm sorry you had that experience. I‚Äôm on my third Tesla and I will never go back to an ICE. But if I had been in your shoes I might have done the same thing. Certainly it was smart to stuff it in their faces and return the car. Such shitty customer service. This is the unfortunate by product of the tech revolution. It‚Äôs all about making sales and attracting new customers. Once you own the product, they don‚Äôt care about you. I hope that you take another chance some day. They really are amazing cars and if you get one without defects (again, I‚Äôm on my third) you never need service. I take it in for an annual check up but I honestly don‚Äôt know what they even do.  Fill up the windshield wiper fluid?"
"It sucks watching the service slowly go to shit. I had heard stories of the first wave of customers getting greeted with white gloves and a red carpet.

Even when we took our used 2016 X for warranty work they had free water and coffee and had someone walk around the car with us to verify the problem. Then they gave us a loaner car to use for a few days while they worked on our car. Impressed.

Then there was our last visit 5 months ago. No loaner (just a 1 way Uber voucher). Walked in to a unkept lobby. No humans, just a tablet kiosk. No coffee or water. All the windows to the repair floor were blacked out so you couldn't even look at the mechanics. Finally someone (a nice person nonetheless) came out and finished our transaction on a janky point of sale system."
Porsche Taycan looking better and better.
"My SR+ convinced me that EV is the way to go and I will not buy any ICE vehicles for daily use, but the Tesla service experience convinced me to buy other EV brands in the future."
"This is my biggest concern at the moment.

The closest service center to me is 3-4 hours away. 

If I had any issues with my vehicle after I purchased it It would be a gigantic hassle."
"1. Never buy the first model year of any car
2. Sue them"
"And yet people will still say ""BuT thEy'Re an InnovAtor/grOwiNg ComPany."" Or whataboutism about that time they had a shitty experience with Mercedes/BMW/Volvo. Or recommend someone tweet the CEO of the company do he can make more empty promises about improving CS. I'm sure this post will get downvoted but the OP got such bad service that I feel like Nissan treated me like royalty when I bought my Sentra in 2014.  

Competition is the only thing that will change this. It can't come soon enough."
"this is my nightmare scnario as well. I don't own a tesla car yet because I am in MI and the full service center finally was able to go online and I talked to someone thru phone over there and he said they don't ahve every thing yet for the real ""full"" service.

I will wait and see how it goes but customer support being decent is a must for me."
"What a disaster. Service matters, and Tesla utterly failed."
"Demand for the car is what makes the service people not care for customers. I complained about the paint ( which they eventually fixed) before accepting my new M3. But the initial offer they gave was, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt like the (new) car as is, you are free to go. We are not forcing you make a purchase.‚Äù I was like WTF!!! After I spoke with another person, then it got resolved to my satisfaction. Later my first service appointment was for wheel alignment and it‚Äôs covered under warranty with free Uber credit and Model S courtesy vehicle in 4 days. I guess I was lucky. BTW, I liked the M3 more than S."
It seems like Tesla is being petty and greedy not to invest in a great customer service.
Kansas star casino?
"This post is Tesla customer service in a nutshell. They continually push customers away in the service department for the past couple years, and it flat out sucks. It‚Äôs a real shame because the cars are great, the service is just horrible."
Thank you for sharing. This is the kind of thing I also cannot afford in any new car. I need the car and the customer service to be as flawless as the new and used Honda‚Äôs I‚Äôve driven in the past. This kind of experience tells me Tesla has a long way to go before they are there.
Sadly stories like this are why I'm likely to end up with a VW group BEV.
"You have done nothing wrong, Tesla should really cover this. Quite embarrasing, I hope Elon sees this."
Ouch. This sounds awful. Being 250 miles from the nearest service center is a deal-breaker. The cars are great but my 3 still needed about 3-5 visits to the SC. I can‚Äôt recommend Tesla to my Midwest fam and friends yet because there just aren‚Äôt enough places close by to have them serviced. Hopefully just a matter of time...
"Really bummed to hear about your service and so many others' experiences here in this thread.

FWIW I've had my Model 3 for two years now and the few services I've had done (PCS replacement, flat tire, headlight replacement and HW3 upgrade) were handled flawlessly by mobile service and the Devon, PA service center. Literally they could not have done anything better.

While customer service is definitely still an issue for Tesla I would never know it from personal experience."
"1,100 dollars for a fucking tow. Did they transport it from the East coast to the West?"
"This is exactly why I am glad the lead on the Cybertruck is so long. It would be my first Tesla and, if it were available today, I wouldn't get it. Closest center to me is about 5 hours away and if they don't get better with these issues and care about expanding location footprint, I'm going to have to pass. Ironically, as far as a truck goes, everyone knows that rural America is hands down truck country and yeah, it'll take some time to catch on, but they are seriously not understanding the market if they don't put in at least more Superchargers around here. As it stands now, there is only 1. At the airport in the city closest to me, about 45 minutes away."
"I have pretty much the opposite story and experience. Tesla service has been awesome. I‚Äôve had like 3 things in a year that needed attention. The worst was some bubbling on the dash. I took a photo and they immediately said that‚Äôs not ok and it needed to be replaced. I took my car in (M3) and they gave me a loaner S. It was a two day repair. They completely replaced the dash. On the way to return the S and pick up my car I had a blowout. I called the number in the car they sent a tow truck. I rode in the truck to the service center and picked up my car and went home. Didn‚Äôt pay a cent for any of it. It was a pain that it happened, but I‚Äôve had more time in the service center with my 2018 Audi so it‚Äôs just random."
"I feel you. Alot of people would hate on anyone who says something bad about tesla. Tesla used to be very easy but alot of people took advantage of that. I have to fight them and get everytbing documented before even bringing the car in to make sure warranty covers it. I cant say the same for the 3 or y, but the s and x always had rattle problems. Now they charge 150 an hr to search and fix rattles. Together my s and x has been to service center over 30 times. Ive since returned the s lease. Im on my third year on the x. Tbh its gotten so bad at service center that i learned to live with the small stuff and fix what i can.... tesla is growing faster than it can handle right now. To be fair they have gotten better. It was extremely bad in 2019 if you needed service in some area."
"Yikes. Glad you were able to return it. If they wouldn't take it, you could likely enact lemon law to get a replacement. Sorry you had this experience. Hopefully in the future, you try again and it is smooth."
"I had a similar issue on my M3 about 2 weeks into ownership. They tried blaming me because I had used some of my own poprivets after getting home from a road trip to fix the issue. 

They refused to admit that this was a manufacturing issue as there was absolutely no possibility this could be an escape from factory quality checks. It took forty minutes of obnoxious loud talking in the waiting room before they said they were willing to fix it for under warranty as an act of ‚Äúgood faith‚Äù. 
 
Definitely left a lot to be desired from the customer service perspective. I can understand nothing will ever be built with no quality issues, just fucking take care of your customers."
honestly Tesla service has been pretty good to me every time I‚Äôve gone. I‚Äôm extremely annoyed that I had to go in the first place. I‚Äôm also annoyed that they fix one thing and break another and don‚Äôt bother to fix what they broke. At least they owned up to it and are willing to address it.
I just placed my order for model Y and after reading lot of the comments I'm not too sure I want to proceed with it.  Hope their service gets better.
I can‚Äôt believe they just quietly accepted the return instead of working to save the sale. Lazy.
"> Disappointed about this outcome, I decide to leave the store to try and get some answers from corporate.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but you were talking to corporate. This isn't a franchise and Tesla dealers don't exist. It's like being at company HQ and them saying you're at the wrong HQ

They had a golden opportunity to make it near perfect, including after sales support. Swing and a miss.

Also, the aero shields on my 3 are also hard and plastic."
"I‚Äôve posted this several times before, but I bought my parents a Lexus (with their money) instead of a Tesla because I knew they would not tolerate anything at all about the delivery and service experiences. I‚Äôd end up having to do everything for them, at best, and deal with my parents‚Äô complaints about Tesla at worst.

I‚Äôve long gone from just raving about everything Tesla to *always* warning people that Tesla is difficult to deal with.  I tell everyone who asks not to buy one if they‚Äôre not willing to put up with a lot of frustration to own what I still think is the best car I‚Äôve ever driven."
This is why I have AAA.
Support and stories like this are what have turned me away from buying a model 3. Living in a small country where I can‚Äôt even speak to the dealer to make an appointment for a road test scared the crap out of me if something would happen after buying.
Sounds like awful customer service. Hmmm
"I totally get returning the car just out of principle, who can really be bothered with all that shit? 

From what I've heard with the Model 3 when it launched, it was really the same deal with random manufacturing flaws, subpar standards. It sounds like the people at Tesla do try their best to fix the problem and help you out, but it's just a mess. People should probably go in with the expectation that the first 6 months after a new model is released, you're signing up to be a beta tester of you buy the car. If you don't want to deal with that, wait."
"Tesla have gone down hill compared to my initial experiences. When I bought my S they were incredibly helpful, really went out of their way to assist. Now I can barely even get in contact with them. They really do need to get their act together as it'll start hurting the brand."
"Great, I have a Model Y which should be ready for delivery in a couple weeks....."
Tesla being Tesla: doing their upmost best to test the patients of their customers.
"Pros and cons to commission sales. I had getting hounded at a traditional dealerships but when you pay people per say it's ""yes sir, how can I help you sir, good day sir, like me kiss your butt sir"". At my local service center, most of the people have been kind and helpful. Most people want to care but it's hard to keep people motivated when they aren't compensated.   


The flip side to the argument is commission sales will often result in over hyped broken promises. No system is prefect but I can acknowledge the cons of how Tesla operates.  I can't think of any other systems that operate like this and are successful. Well maybe CarMax but I could be wrong about that.  


I have no idea the average pay an employee makes in Tesla's service center and how that compares to average service centers. Or what their customer liaison reps make on average but I'm sure it's pretty low or the compensation is poor."
Try posting on Twitter see if Elon will bite
"Sorry for your loss. I would like to point out to everyone that for every story like this, there are 1000s where people had little problem dealing with Tesla. A pandemic and social unrest also cannot be helping right now, especially with the Model Y production ramp. Personally, the driving experience is so superior in my Model 3, I would put up with a lot more than this individual did. It would take many multiple, consistently terrible experiences to even make me pause and question the ownership or Tesla ecosystem. I also live in a state that has two service centers, which does help, but 95% of my few service needs were handled by mobile rangers."
"And this is one of many reasons as to why I refuse to buy a Tesla. We had friends where it took over a year for them to respond to warranty issues and they still never fixed the car. They owned at least 4 Tesla‚Äôs (mostly corporate cars for their business) and every single one of them had massive service failures. That, and we have had a bunch of friends working at Tesla over the years and they HATED it. 

I will take almost any European or Asian manufacturer over them especially at the price point."
"My wife and I were about to purchase our Y next month but after hearing your story (and others experiencing the same in the Denver area), we have both rethought our decision and will most likely just delay it indefinitely."
"Fortunately, I never had to deal with custom service as of yet, but when taking delivery on my M3P I almost didn't. They got me to sign all the paperwork before I could inspect the car, by the time I was inspecting it the service center employees left for the day.

The rubber seal in the trunk wasn't properly installed, it was obvious and anyone who did an internal inspection should have noticed and dealt with it. My main thought was, if something so obvious was missed, what else did they overlook? There was no plan to deal with any issues, no ""please come back tomorrow, we'll have it all fixed for you"", but instead I got the ""you have to take the car, it's yours now, and you need to make an appointment with a service center"".

Appointment?! I literally didn't even take delivery yet. I decided not to argue, drove the car home and fixed it myself the next morning. Love the car, love what Tesla is doing, but I've never had such a terrible experience, especially considering a $100,000 price tag (after taxes)."
"I'm so sorry that you had such a crappy experience. Clearly Tesla needs to improve many things, including their delivery infrastructure in the Midwest"
"I too had abysmal customer service in the beginning.  My delivery process was an absolute nightmare, had to take my car back because my AC broke within two days, they then dinged my pillar with likely another car door, and then covered it with a shitty paint job with paint bubbles.

I didn‚Äôt see my car for three months.

They definitely need to get their service together."
"I've been getting cold feet about my model y order after hearing about the quality issues, service problems, and this is probably the nail in the coffin for me. Tesla need to fix customer service before I buy."
I have a model Y reservation I refuse to take delivery of until they fix all the production flaws on the model Y. I have heard of so many body and paint issues.
"I would've returned it too, if that was your experience 250 miles down the road what's it going to be like when you add another zero or two to that?"
"Musk/Tesla seems to have ‚Äúcalculated/decided‚Äù that addressing the relatively low (as compared to other makes) number of Tesla errors that occur via top notch customer service is not part of the plan.

This decision extends to customers who have accidents, or other odd service needs.

We can say this was ‚Äúdeliberately decided‚Äù, because not publishing a ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù customer complaint telephone number (with a real person available after a brief hold) is a decision. Not having a Corporate phone number that Tesla Service location managers can call is an outrageous decision.

$1100 is a huge tow bill, but must have been anticipated by business plan that included selling cars in lower density locations, outside of urban hubs like SFO, LA, Boston and NYC.

Having said that, I loved my first 2013 Tesla, and it‚Äôs successor, I bought 18 months ago.

I have to give Musk kudos for being able to raise billions from capital markets, and turning fantasies like affordable electric cars, (and rocket ships etc) into reality.

That means laser focus on not just huge operational issues, but style and messaging that resonates with investors, customers, employees, and even regulators. Part of business plan is serious science based quality control, and flexibility to change design if statistically speaking design has too high risk of remedial defects. (Eg they eliminated sliding sunroof, I presume, for this reason.)

Dealing with odd repairs, customer problems and inventorying needed service parts is not part of the equation..."
Thanks to share. I will stay on the Toyota/Lexus Land for now.
"As a fellow OKC owner it's really a damn shame that Tesla hasn't wanted to figure out there CS issues.  We took delivery (when it was still an option) down in DFW and had a fine experience with our M3.

On one hand, I'm glad you refunded and followed through (and hopefully will continue to press them on follow up interactions).

We've had mostly positive experiences with mobile service and the one time we needed to go down to Plano for service it was pretty good.

Hopefully you get it all sorted out and give Tesla a good what-for in the process.  Hopefully we'll see you in a Tesla (and a member of TOCO) sometime in the future."
Thanks for posting your experience. Stuff like this makes deciding between the Rav4 Prime and Model a little easier.
"Read every word. Sorry this happened. If you had gotten a car that was built right, you'd be enjoying a nice Tesla right now. Instead, they can't fix a mistake and service has to put you through all this crap."
"I am considering returning my Model S. Bought a brand new LRP Model S on Monday and the A/C does not work... I have a service scheduled for next week but it is too far out... The customer service is meh so far, though the entire process has been better than other car manufacturers.

[https://photos.app.goo.gl/zsqKqVbMeGKXaYrf8](https://photos.app.goo.gl/zsqKqVbMeGKXaYrf8)

&#x200B;

It does not work right out of showroom and this error was there while we were driving all the way home and two days later."
"You absolutely did the right thing.  

The problem is that Tesla has no real competition.  While legacy manufacturers are starting to get into the game, Tesla‚Äôs autopilot and super charger network are big distinguishing competitive factors.

The reason why you don‚Äôt have the typical fit finish issues with traditional dealers is that they have to not only compete with other brands, but other dealers selling the same brand in the same market.  So they may try to rip you off on pricing (in a nice way), and might make you jump through hoops for warranty repair in some instances, they know if they piss you off, you will just go down the street to their competitor selling the same cars.

Since Tesla is the only place you can buy a Tesla, there is no inherent competition.  So you get bullshit like misaligned panels and paint defects because the local center isn‚Äôt competing with anyone else so they don‚Äôt care.  And they can do whatever they want service wise because if you want a electric car with decent range, Tesla is your only real option at the moment. 

Tesla was great with service before because volume was low and they were still trying to develop brand recognition.  Now that they have that and volume is up, they are not forced to provide great care.

The legacy manufacturers really need to step up the charger game.  If they could put together a charging network that is better than Tesla and some better products, Tesla would be forced to fix these issues."
"I also had my bottom front plate rip off because it was not secured properly. It turned out one of the front bolts was missing.

It happened when I was driving 230kph on the German autobahn, with strong head winds. I'm happy the plate did not hit anyone, because that would have been super dangerous.

Not a model y, but 3."
"I hear ya... a Ford stealership with 2.5 stars on Yelp still provided gold-standard service compared to the Tesla service center. Speaking from experience.

If I pay 2x what a Toyota Corolla costs, I think I am entitled to Toyota-quality service at the bare minimum. Yeah sure I don't need much maintenance with a Tesla but if panels are falling apart or the window refuses to stay closed (this happened to mine 8 days after delivery) then I'm going to need service."
"you know, some day people are going to have to stop buying their cars if we want this to change. this is the reason i dont own one yet, and if it isnt better by the time the competition steps up, ill simply buy another brand."
"Buying a car from a company that actually doesn't know jack shit about selling cars...what could go wrong?
Tesla is a train wreck accelerating downhill. The inertia will reach a critical point. They have novel technology (or they've got people convinced that they do, ala Apple), so demand is high and you can crap all over customers...but at some point all that will end."
That‚Äôs why you folks shouldn‚Äôt be wasting your money on a brand new car in it‚Äôs first model year. Just like how I don‚Äôt buy the first generation of Apple‚Äôs products after a redesign. You are basically a beta tester. Should have purchased a Model S or Model 3 now that most of the kinks are worked out.
Buy another and return it. Keep it up until you feel like you got 1k worth. This is ridiculous.
I think the great thing is that you can actually return the car. I don't think you can do that with any other car.
Will definitely look at other cars after reading this post. Was interested but not now.
Fucking hell.
This should end up on Elon Musk desk and he must set a precedent. A good car is not great without its customer service.
Tldr?
I'm starting my new job at Tesla probably in august and all i'm doing right now is literally reading through all customer service reviews and stories because i love Tesla and i want to make a change there. This is not okay..
Yikes!
"I‚Äôve finally sold my wife on both of us getting Tesla‚Äôs when our leases are up - despite loving our Hyundais. Multiple of them for years.

As of reading this, I am sticking with Hyundai and definitely won‚Äôt be buying Tesla‚Äôs. I‚Äôm sorry you went through all that OP, hope you get confirmation and peace soon."
"I was planning to get a Tesla, but hearing about the build quality and customer service from friends, I was on the fence. Thanks to your post, I decided not to. 

I have been buying various car brands since the early 90‚Äôs and I have never experienced this, especially for an expensive car like Model Y."
I get that. We've had some issues with our not even 1 year old 3 and the service centre is 300km away. Sorry to hear this
Dude! I have the same issue with my model 3 with the rear part tho. Ripped right off away from the bolts
"I live 150 miles from service and was somewhat worried about needing repairs, but haven‚Äôt had any major problems in over 5 years of ownership. The 500 miles of warranty towing is reassuring, but I haven‚Äôt needed it and Tesla is scheduled to open a service center in my area soon."
"My experience is Tesla has really crappy customer service... things go well they go well, things don‚Äôt they are clueless..."
"I‚Äôm definitely fortunate that I live 20 minutes from a service center. My MS has had the typical issues with handles and a few other minor things but my experience has been very positive. They sent a mobile repair tech to my work and to my house to fix anything that has popped up. Blew out my front two tires (haven‚Äôt gone back to the 21‚Äù wheels since) and they towed for free to a third party tire shop, no questions asked. I guess it‚Äôs a regional thing, I may just be lucky."
"This is unacceptable and as a shareholder I would like to apologise for this.  It‚Äôs likely a mix of every misfortune you could have but I don‚Äôt blame you for sending it back & walking away from bad service.  
I hope the company learns from this. Thank you for voicing this story"
"This is the future of customer service at most companies now, unfortunately. Every time I need to call customer service for anything i end up hitting 14 different options and then finding out my issue isn‚Äôt covered by their atrocious AI I usually start just saying , ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù over and over again.  but the companies are defeating that method so that they‚Äôll never have to be contacted by anyone. The future is here and it‚Äôs terrible. What can you do?"
"First off, that sucks! I hope/wish tesla would make this right for you. You were well within your rights / 7 day return window and I likely would have done the same with a bad apple. I've done it before with a Tesla MS that I denied delivery until they gave me a new one.

But... some point of advice when owning ANY automobile:

$1100 for a 250 mi TOW?!  JFC is the tow truck clad in gold leaf?  I don't think I've paid that out in my AAA premier membership for the last 10 years and get 300mi tows up to three times a year for that plan & they'd cover the hotel expense too. Lockout services, hotel discounts, etc. Look into AAA if you ever decide to go with a tesla again. Even the lack of being in your state means you could still probably get a cheaper tow since rates over the 300mi are pretty cheap per mile, 30-60c / mi .. Not $4.50 a mile like you got charged.

&#x200B;

I've always been burned by auto manufacturer's, (BMW, Toyota, Porsche) roadside assistance whenever I used it prior to getting AAA and now that I've seen the promised land, it's a small, cheap insurance policy to have."
"I love Tesla too, but one of the biggest annoyances is getting to be able to talk to somebody. Customer service and direct communication needs to be fixed at Tesla, it's a huge downside honestly and will turn some people away from them even though their cars are really great."
Sounds like Tesla still has a longgg way to go. Anyone living in California has similar experience? I wonder if the customer service would be better since Tesla HQ is in California so the communications would be easier
This honestly discouraged me from buying a Tesla. Customer service has been a consistent gripe among so many Tesla owners
"I have an absolutely mechanically flawless Model S. Unfortunately my experience with service is much the same. No communication, contradictory information when they do communicate, etc."
But why would you have to travel to another city to get your delivery. Don't they deliver in your city? Do everyone in your city have to travel to another city to get their Teslas?

"I feel like if this was any other car company, this wouldn't happen."
"Had a different, but also crappy delivery experience and horrible customer service and vehicle service experiences with my 3. Didn‚Äôt return the car, but probably won‚Äôt ever buy another Tesla."
Can you better describe what part was loose? I don't understand.
Yeah. Im just gonna buy a toyota prime tundra or rav at some point. Heard a lot of stories like this.
I am really happy I read this thread. Definitely confirms that waiting a few more years to buy is a smart move for me personally.
"As much as I love Tesla too, no one paying that kind of money should be treated like that. 
We are talking about a $53k car here, after all.  

I hope they can learn from this."
"I honestly think you made the right choice. My experience with Tesla service, albeit in another country, is poor. I‚Äôve been met by incompetence, lies, stonewalling and gaslighting - to name a few. It‚Äôs utterly frustrating. 

Trying to be the Apple of car manufacturers is not a good thing for service. I‚Äôve owned iPhones for 11 years and never had an issue, but I know that if something happens that isn‚Äôt a well known and covered issue I can expect to have to bend over and take it. I‚Äôm a bit more OK with that concept for Apple than I am for Tesla, because there‚Äôs a slight difference in the investment. 

Tesla make great cars (when everything is bolted together and works), but the service quality is abysmal, and our experiences aren‚Äôt alone. Some people have taken delivery of vehicles with loose bumpers and been told that they‚Äôre within spec."
"I get your fear of future mishap. The combination of bad experience & distance from your home would worry me too. Not in that position so can't judge if this would be enough for me to return the car.

It's a shame your SC ""handled it"" the way they did. My SC definitely works in another fashion, boss gave me his mobile number when delivery threatened to go sour.

I don't care about problems (shit happens) I do care about the way businesses resolve them. Tesla seems hit or miss depending on the SC. That's not ok."
"Customer service logics has been and still is Teslas achilles heel. I am fortunate in that the few customer services issues I have had all involved mobile service and were smooth, fast, and hassle-free. But I know from reading others accounts that if you have to try and call to talk to a human, be prepared for aggravation and run-around. They don't do it maliciously, they just have stupidly inefficient logistics like you pointed out of communicating via email instead of being able to call and get ahold of someone."
"Is Tesla the Comcast of carmakers? Great product, until it isn‚Äôt..."
"I live in Los Angeles and I'm terrified of getting into an accident in my Tesla because repair process will probably suck even though there are many service centers around. You people living in the middle of nowhere where you have to drive many hours to pick up your car are just crazy to buy a Tesla. 

And don't expect the service to get any better since this is something they are not looking to improve as a high priority. If you have problems with your Tesla and if it's drive-able, you will have to live with it until they can fix it. If it's not drive-able, then they will probably give you a loaner car to drive until your car is fixed. Their priority is to make more cars and accepting the fact that a large percentage of their cars won't have any issues, and for the few that do, then it's acceptable loss to them, even if that pisses off some customers.

They will continue to push to make their cars perform better, make them more affordable, have more range with better battery, and ability to produce them rapidly with more factories. Second to that is building the supercharger network to cover the major cities and interstates. As for service and repairs improvements, that will move at Gary the snail speed. 

What they are hoping for is once FSD is ready, their fleet of robo-taxies will be the way to go. It's like people in NYC where it's crazy for someone to own a car and the majority don't. So for most, to get around, it is cheaper to ride the robo-taxies than driving your own car or taking an Uber. They could make something like a subscription where it's $300/month for transportation. This sounds like a fantasy but this is what Elon is thinking. And so if the future is taking away car ownership for most people, then why invest in improving service and repairs when only a small percentage will prefer to own their cars?

I know it sounds like a very far-fetched conclusion to make, but this is coming someone who has very little faith in FSD as it is right now. I'll be really shocked if it will be good enough to drive itself 100%, not now or ever unless they make some drastic changes beyond HW3.0."
"So sad to lose a customer like this, but I understand how annoying and stressful that must have been"
"> I think they were shocked and I was told this was the first time any customer had done this (at their location).

I guess, in that case you might have done the right thing. I guess that might start a thought-process for some of the people there and open their eyes (I guess the manager of that SC is not amused when he hears about a car returned, especially for such a reason). No way, they couldn't escalate this, ask their manager etc., there is most likely always a way. But saying ""no"" is just... well, easier, right?"
"So by my understanding, the biggest problem isn't that you had to pay for the tow truck, as that would be the case with most cares as well, but the fact you were promised that they would pay for it and then they went back on it, and they did so by burying you in red tape"
"Sorry to hear your experience OP. Buying a Tesla is definitely an interesting experience. Their poor customer service is really imo based on the fact that they have people waiting in line to buy their product and have no real competition. Hopefully they improve soon. FWIW this terrible customer service is similar to my experience dealing with other car manufacturers and with Apple, Sony, HP, Amazon, Verizon, etc. Customer service on the phone is useless when the person barely speaks English, is reading from a script and is powerless to help you."
">I spend the next hour trying to get through to a real person which shockingly is more difficult than I thought it would be.¬† 

I can relate to this so hard. They need more humans on the phone. Their AI menu navigation isn't cutting it. Otherwise their roadside assistance would be overwhelmed and people who actually need it won't be able to get through, which is mighty serious."
"Wow, I don't fault you at all for cutting it loose. They may (or may not) make it sort of right in the end but nothing will pay for the nightmare you had to go through."
This might be the first thread I‚Äôve read every single post on. I had plans to test drive the M3 soon and really had decided to buy one unless the test drive just sucked. Now I‚Äôm really considering not moving forward. Amazing how one person‚Äôs experience can lead to so many others agreeing. I‚Äôm not sure I read more than one or two people contradicting the horrible customer service. And that really bothers me...
"Don‚Äôt wait for a refund, it will never come. I had to hound them weekly for almost 6 months before I got a $600 refund for a car rental they ‚Äòpre-approved‚Äô while my vehicle was being serviced."
"I had a huge problem with Tesla and their corporate dept regarding their solar panels. So much back and forth and they wouldn‚Äôt cover damage because I didn‚Äôt take the extra coverage, *which was never offered to me.*"
"Damn it, I‚Äôll have to put my Tesla dreams on hold. I really don‚Äôt want to deal with the customer service desk based some of the experiences in the thread. I hope it improves soon!"
"Aero shields are a common problem. I had mine come loose and lost bolts on my 2018 Model 3. Granted it took 4 months and driving in 40 mph winds to pull it loose. There are service bulletins on these panels from back then that they fall apart being wet.

I hate the material they used. It's easy to tear up over time. It's cheap and light. Still $300 for one every other year if they haven't made them more sturdy sucks.

I REALLY HATE the same material is the wheel arches and collect so much grass and other garbage."
These stories are far too common. Exactly why I passed on buying one. I loved the car but the quality and customer service experience are not up to par.
"My CEO actually does read tweets. We are a 20k person Engineering firm. You are the first to return a Y, that is significant enough for some optics to be put on the situation.  It is shit like this why I am glad I am way down the list on the CT. I'll just tool around happy in my Q50 Hybrid Sport. My wife has a M3P, she calls my car the Tesla on food stamps..üò°"
Someone should share this post with Elon on Twitter
Sounds like Robinhood!
I'm feeling better that I have my model Y on hold cause of the uncertainty with my company. Gives them time to work out the kinks for future productions.
"Tesla service is lousy because it doesn't need  to be good. People are going to buy Tesla either way, so why spend the time and money on good service when lousy service will keep the customers coming back in?"
"Thank you for this! The KC location is the closest one to me, but I'm still a few hours away. Hopefully this customer service communication issue is resolved by the time I'm in a position to purchase my dream vehicle."
"I like Tesla.  But will never be a fan boy. Thank you for sharing your story. We need to understand all flaws before we make the company improve.

Hopefully this gets looked at or they could lose more customers."
"I don't get the TESLA no dealer model. You don't test drive your own car before purchase, you are discouraged from maintaining  your own car, and and have poor parts and service availability with frequently long wait times. Is this supposed to be an improvement over the standard model in the auto industry or just a way to save money at the expense of customer service?"
"Hol up, model Y, guess it still didnt release in my area."
"This is my biggest concern about buying a Tesla.  My brother-in-law and sister bought a Model X and had a terrible experience in the buying process.  It seems that the reason Tesla can get away with it right now is that the product is compelling enough with no real alternatives, hence there is a ""take it or leave it"" attitude.  When dropping $100K on a car, you would think that generally you'd have a pleasant experience, but most parts of Tesla (the company) seem to have had a lot of growing pains from the rapid scaling up that the company is going through.

I really hope they focus on the customer experience a bit more in the future so it isn't something that you just have to ""Grit your teeth and get through"" before being able to enjoy the car."
I want a Tesla so bad but I live 4 hours from a service center. This stuff terrifies me.
"It took me a while to get a deposit refund. I‚Äôd advise that you keep a log of who you communicate with and what was said. Keep your e-mail and paperwork.

I don‚Äôt blame you for the return, not having a local shop makes things more difficult."
"No surprise, sounds similar to model 3 deliveries.  Sorry you had to go through this.  I had to go through a car exchange on my Model 3 and it is not fun dealing with them."
"Sorry you went through this! It's a real bummer :( Their products are amazing. Like any other company, they have bad apples from time to time. If their customer service was on top of it like one expects it would totally be overlooked. But instead it makes it even more frustrating and difficult to deal with"
Not encouraging.
I‚Äôm sorry you had such a bad experience with the support. my model 3 had the same issue it ripped about 100 miles away from home I called support they told me it was safe to drive just go slow the next day I had took it to the service center about another 60 miles away and they fixed it in like 30 min free of charge.
"Damn that sucks. I remember seeing your first post about this and was hoping they would make it right. Sorry this happened. I love my 3, but you are 100% warranted in your decision."
"This does nothing good for their ""anti dealer"" campaign. Any dealership I've dealt with would be falling over themselves trying to make that new purchase correct. Especially when you get up to the $60K range."
Things like this make it easier for me to wait for the Model Y to have all the kinks worked out
...so you‚Äôre telling me there is gonna be a used Model Y on the market somewhere?!  ü§îü§î
"That is absolutely terrible. Tesla still have ways to go to improve on customer service. I think they should focus on that ahead of launching more new products. If they are facing this now, how things would be in 2 years with cybertruck out and they are selling over million cars out of US alone"
"As a very big tesla fan, i'm really sad that storys like that happen. I know it's hard to execute everything perfect every time, but they had a long time to improve service issues in such rare cases. They are no more an Silicon Valley startup (which usually suck at customer support) theys are a  fully grown company who does not only serve a fanbase but normal people. I know (from single anectodes)  that BMW or VW dealerships in some cases have the same issues, but I as a Teslafan want them to BE GODDAMN BETTER then those. 

I personally visited the service center 3 times for minor issues and they handled it well, not perfect but i didn't have much to complain."
"Should have sent a Tweet at Elon, Tesla was known to have subpar customer service to begin with. This should get his attention."
"I just read an article about this in a german news site, this is seriously bad PR"
"And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why I will not yet purchase a Tesla.  I will give it some time to mature."
"Sorry for your experiences, you have just discovered Tesla‚Äôs kryptonite. Unfortunately, I only see it getting worse and not with just service.  I see charging and quality as potential problems.   Can they change? Yes.  Will they? They should to stay in business but not sure when the light bulbs will go off.  Seems like the focus is expanding production of the disposable car.   
Grew too fast and focused on production and stocks.   Service makes money(Tesla has not figured this out yet).  I want to believe employees support the vision and want to help, but are overwhelmed with their tasks and have very few decision makers to solve customer‚Äôs issues. 
Tesla excels at charging infrastructure(for now), electronics/software and make a decent automobile(not a great one).  Owners give them a pass to support the vision.  Fit and finish is not good.  Delivery of a new vehicle is like buying something from Best Buy.   
Service can‚Äôt handle the volume.  A year ago, I had to wait 3 weeksI(make an appointment) to change the car‚Äôs low 12V battery (under warranty)with a warning that car may not function if charge was too low.  Fortunately, I had another car for my daily commute.   At least my M3 gave me the warning, as my BMW i3 just died and left me stranded a work late at night.  One cannot change this battery without expertise for danger of electric shock from the high voltage battery.   
I still like my M3 but with all the new M3s and MYs out there, I will be moving on from Tesla.   Just gave Tesla too many passes to continue to buy from them for now."
"This is my biggest concern about Tesla - it sounds like they grew too fast and have over-promised and under delivered. The build quality suffers as a result.

I was shocked to see the STEERING wheel of one Tesla just pop off.

I can‚Äôt see myself ever buying a Tesla in the near future - sure they‚Äôve innovated a lot of tech but if build quality and customer service is poor, that‚Äôs a big question mark. 

It feels like a company built by engineers and the customer experience is for engineers and no one else. 

Anyone looked at the Jaguar I-pace suv and compare it to Tesla ?"
Sorry to hear. This is probably the #1 reason why I‚Äôm hesitant to purchase a Tesla. I appreciate you sharing your story.

"What a horror story. Tesla honestly needs to allow customers to self-service their rides imo as it will scale better. Sell us parts directly with simple guides a real car mechanic can follow  if needed, I bet many parts a general car enthusiast can likely replace as well if its not to intense a job."
"Such a minor issue, but resulted an unhappy customer and a great car returned. Tesla should learn a lot from this. That service center has major problems. My serves center has been fantastic. 

&#x200B;

1. Manufacturing should not have this issue in the first place, that would be the lowest cost.
2. During the first phone call they should understand the issue, allow the owner tape it and drive home. Promise that a ranger will quickly fix it, warrantee stay intact.
3. Once the issue escalated, they should do the right things make the customer happy.
4. They need someone to address complains on social media. 

Readers should keep this in perspective: out of 100,000 deliveries per quarter, this kind of story is a very small percentage. Majority customers are very happy with the products."
"First and only car i bought new was a VW   when i picked it up i was excited as it was the first new car...sadly no welcome pack and no explanation of car features just handed the keys at reception and told where the car was parked...

Driving down the highway and the wind noise was horrific...to keep the story short i took the car back 5 times and eventually the manager apologised and said the car should have been perfect the first time i picked it up.....eventually everything was fixed but damn i was upset and soon sold the car to get a Nissan..."
">My comment about loving Tesla comes from all the things they are trying to accomplish. The car had very little issues (no more than any other new car I had purchased).


Except you literally couldnt drive it home. And they jerked you around for 2 days.

  Wondering what would it take for you to be neutral about this company?



'This car locked all its doors in summer with my daughters puppy inside, it suffered a horrible death. I guess overall I'm slightly disappointed with my purchase'"
Good for you for not allowing yourself to be jerked around like so many others here do for no good reason. It‚Äôs never going to get better until they have to start eating refunds like this.
Sorry to hear. This is probably the #1 reason why I‚Äôm hesitant to purchase a Tesla. I appreciate you sharing your story.
Did you ask them to replace the Y with a new one?  This is an extreme case- hope you can give them another chance.
Tesla's are garbage!
"$1100 to tow a fucking car!?

America is a joke..."
"I just tweeted this to Elon, hope it gets some attention!!"
But stock is at $1000/share don't do this to me
It sucks this happened. But are you sure you're up for car ownership? It sounds like a very minor issue has really set you back.
[deleted]
"It sucks that you went through this, but I just want to point a few things out:

1. Travel to and from service centers is not covered by the *new car warranty*. It explicitly says that you must *deliver the vehicle at your expense*.
2. Roadside assistance is what provides the towing service, and is a separate service entirely. It's lame that they weren't communicating better, but that's how it is with other cars as well.
3. Most Roadside Assistance programs (Ford, etc) allow for 35 miles of towing. Tesla allows for 50 miles, or 500 miles if it's a warranty issue (which your issue technically is not). They might have been balking because your tow bill was $1,100 for less than 200 miles. That's absolutely nuts, and well beyond the US average $4/mi.
4. Re-torquing of nuts/bolts is considered *maintenance* and isn't covered under the new car warranty. If they were willing to do the work for free that's nice, but it's not technically warranty service.

Either way, I understand why you got frustrated, I just wanted to point out why this wasn't a straight forward issue for them to resolve. No matter what, their support teams need to improve on communication with customers AND each other. No excuses for that."
"I'm sure you could pinpoint the refusal to pay the tow truck bill to a single individual within Tesla, probably at the service center, that will likely be disciplined. I understand you had a poor experience but using that as a basis to return the vehicle is an overreaction. It's a phenomenal car from a phenomenal company. You had a bad service experience and because of that are going to purchase a different vehicle. That's your choice and Tesla's loss, but also your own."
TLDR
"Well. I guess they aren‚Äôt infallible, they are still a car company.

Tin foil hat time: account active for 100+ days. These are the first comments/posts. Conspiracy theory over ü§™"
"This string of negative Model Y stories is....peculiar. Not to be a conspiracy theorist, but I've been around long enough to sniff out unusual trends in the community as TSLA's stock price goes up. Just saying."
You should have been more patient. There's a process they need to go through that takes a little time. Now you lost your cool car and if I was Tesla I wouldn't sell you another. You freaked out over a minor warranty issue and then went on social media to embarrass them. Just got my MYP last Friday and I love it.

"That‚Äôs not very typical, I‚Äôd like to make that point...

"Not even sure how I came across this article, but you sound completely incompetent and should probably ride the bus. 
It‚Äôs a piece of plastic shrouding. No. Big. Deal!
I feel bad for Tesla customer service...you definitely shouldn‚Äôt own a Tesla or any other vehicle for that matter! Enjoy your tow bill."
"Not even the slightest try in proving that you even owned a Tesla, much less that this really happened. So I'm going to mentally file this away under ""paid FUD""."
Sucks that you missed out on a Tesla likely due to issues caused by Covid üò≠
"You guys are so gulable this is the fakest story I've ever heard... Bought a car.. not even taking a video of the sounds, Pictures og the flap.. we are reading a story here folks who want reddit to jump on hating Elon Musk lol"
"Haven‚Äôt heard anything from Tesla since I walked out of the store yesterday. I really just want a confirmation that my refund is in process. I know it will take 30+ days, but want to avoid it being longer."
"I have to agree that Tesla service before purchase, delivery, and any time I want to speak with a human is the worst customer service I have ever received. We have a Model X Raven and you would think I was buying a cheap used car based on the buying experience I received. When we purchased our Mercedes, I had sales and service people doing anything to make sure I was 100% satisfied. Tesla customer service was insulting and I truly hope I never have to deal with them. The local service center and showroom don't know much beyond product specifications and couldn't give me any information that I couldn't read myself in my account.

To the point about the local service center only communicating via email, I had a similar experience when I was looking for a replacement tire that had a nail go through the sidewall. I was trying to find out if my local service center actually had a tire in stock and the person I (finally) got on the phone was in a call center and had no way, other than email, to reach the service center. I wound up working with my local tire shop to order the correct tire and they gave me a temporary, brand new non-matching tire to hold me over until the proper one arrived. 

For the $100k we spent on this car, I expect more. I expect a high level of customer service. I just hope someone at Tesla finally wakes up and takes action. I worry if not, I'll have to dump the car for a loss and go back to Mercedes or Cadillac or something when I can't get an issue resolved."
"Yes yes yes! We also have terrible customer service here in Germany (Hannover) and have been waiting months for basic repairs. I am getting a very bad feeling about the actual status of Tesla's entire organization. No parts available, the service manager tried to convince me to pay for a warranty issue as well. 3 appointments and everything is still broken that was broken before. I am getting fed up and ready to buy am Audi or BMW as I mostly charge at home, so SUC doesn't matter to me."
"They don't give a shit

When my SC gave me the wrong car and I had other issues, I tired fo escalate to a bunch of people including regional VPs. None of them replied. 

All I got was a big standard call back from a gal at the SC. No other follow up or apology."
"These issues are a perfect test case for why dealership models exist. The company can't control everyone and doesn't pay enough to have very competent boots on the ground. Yes dealers are often slimy and use bad practices, but there is usually a senior manager or owner somewhere within reach."
"One of the reasons I left the company. When they decided to turn off the phones to the service center, ensuring owners (and other employees) couldn't speak to a human was the straw that broke the camels back. 6 months after I left, turned in my Model S lease and haven't looked back!"
"If OP wants anything done, probably best to tweet Elon."
"Tesla VP of Customer Service, that‚Äôs a laugh.  Love the car but everything else is a shit show."
"I‚Äôve learned in business that resolving customer problems does more to earn repeat business than having a flawless customer experience. In my experience this is absolutely true. It doesn‚Äôt mean you can push shoddy products, rather that mistakes happen and dealing with them proactively will resonate more with a customer than a flawless purchase."
"If I were to put a cynical hat on I‚Äôd say it would make a lot of sense for companies to consider going above and beyond with things like this for at least as long as the customer has the option to return the car for a full refund. If they don‚Äôt, and things like this happen, they‚Äôre liable to get more people responding the way you have - returning the car within the 7 day window (or longer in some countries)

Obviously Tesla should be aiming to deliver exceptional customer service anyway, but for someone so soon into ownership it is critical to keep them on board with the brand, and reassure them that their long term ownership experience is not going to be stressful, when they encounter problems such as these.

Tesla will have lost more than $1,100 in this car once all is said and done, after reselling it as ‚Äúnearly new‚Äù etc."
"> This is the perfect test case for the company to use for massive improvements

It will fall on deaf ears - the person whose desk this is supposed to fall on to make those changes is Elon and he doesn't sit down at that desk or understand why service / support are important.

A few years ago, Tesla had a man named Jon McNeill working as the head of Tesla Service and Support.  That was when they had a great reputation - Tesla being Tesla they still had hiccups, but a complaint like this one would get Jon himself to call you - or you could call him and they would call you back (This was also back when Tesla had phones) to talk and sort everything out before it went viral.  Jon smoothed over a growing company's problems and worked to try and solve them for the next buyer before they happened.  

When Jon left, Elon said they weren't replacing him, and that Elon was taking over as head of Service / Support.  Everyone predicted service and support would collapse - and it did.  Elon is a big picture guy, he isn't a people person and he isn't capable of doing the service/support job.  

Until they hire someone capable, Tesla service and support will continue to get worse and worse like it has been since the hour Jon McNeill submitted his resignation.  Until then, Tesla won't react to problems like this, or if it does it's only as a 1-case special circumstance response to massive bad publicity with no intention of solving the underlying problems that caused it."
"I have had my Tesla since 2014 and it has been in the shop greater than twenty five times... motor replaced, sunroof replaced, brakes replaced twice due to warping, screen replaced twice, parts replaced with other parts that absolutely do not match and they don‚Äôt make the older parts any longer, glass replaced, charger caught fire, and more... I joke that I now have the modern day version of Johnny Cash‚Äôs automobile (https://youtu.be/sIuo0KIqD_E).

I can tell you with no uncertainty, you received the common Tesla experience.  Unorganized, policies change often, every one agreeing that a particular outcome is the right outcome, but nobody empowered to make it happen, high turnover, and poorly trained customer service reps.  They needed to change my screen and they told me they didn‚Äôt have the part... it‚Äôs been over a year and they never called me, my car is currently not drivable, I have call monthly and have NEVER once got a live person on the phone and the service center voicemail has been full for that year.  Welcome to Tesla."
"I got one of the first Model 3's, and my experience was stellar because I was still getting the same treatment as the X/S customers at that point. My wife was so impressed by my car that she had to order one, too; 6 months later and her experience was the exact opposite. We had to refuse delivery the first time because of a nasty paint problem. Everything from then on that could have gone wrong, did. To the point that she was accused by collections inside Tesla of taking delivery of the car and not paying for it. ""Sometimes, people get so excited to receive their car, they forget to pay."" She was literally accused of Grand Theft Auto by Tesla. It was stunning. She loves the car, but holy hell the delivery was absolute shit. It's been my observation by this and other issues posted on this subreddit (and other forums) that going down the ideal, problem-free ""happy path"" of the process is great and most people have that privilege (me included). However, the instant you veer off that path (usually through no fault of your own), the whole thing goes to shit. So, statistically, Tesla probably sees that ""the majority of customers are happy, and yes there are outliers but it's under control."" However the sheer horror of being one of those ""outliers"" is beyond disastrous.

Things have really been going well for Tesla lately: The stock is on absolute fire, MSM seems to have turned the corner on Tesla, people love the cars, and Elon seems to have put down the crack pipe lately on Twitter. **Tesla leadership: the last piece of the puzzle is service.** Tesla will not become the world-class auto maker it desires to be (and we're all rooting for) unless service is addressed and promptly. In its current state, it's not acceptable in the least. Sincerely, adoring customer and shareholder."
Tweet this @ Elon. That mofo better get his shit in order
"VP of Customer Experience?  Has that existed at all since Jon McNeill left, other than Elon indicating he'd take over those responsibilities?

(he hasn't, effectively leading to no one handling the customer experience)

Even mid-level managers having no power to rectify issues is consistent with the nightmare that was my attempt to order a Model 3 in central/western NY - even after a regional sales manager reached out to me (or at least someone claiming to be so), he never once really managed to achieve a resolution to anything.  He claimed eventually that he'd arranged for a refund of my deposit in response to a strongly worded email that I'd never do business with Tesla again (albeit too late, my credit card company resolved in my favor on the same day).  After that, I told him I'd give Tesla the benefit of the doubt regarding that, and that I was even willing to buy a UMC from the accessory store (TeslaTap + UMC is one of the best EVSE solutions on the market).

Since then:

1) Constant error KR36 issues from the website

2)  Indication at one point that my account had been banned/locked because Tesla was butthurt about losing a $100 dispute as a result of bait-and-switch tactics.  (Password reset would say ""account not found"", attempting to recreate would result in errors).  That seems to have resolved itself, but still...  Any attempt to do business with Tesla has been a failure.  I give up.

A reputable company would take losing a credit card dispute as a red flag that they should fix documentation and update policies to avoid infringing laws against bait-and-switch...  But that's not Tesla.

Tesla has kindasorta updated documentation such that they might be able to win another such bait-and-switch fight, but barely.  They no longer promise ""nearest service center"", just ""delivery center"", but give no way to determine what is a delivery center prior to ordering.  They use weasel words of ""all eligible customers"" for Tesla Direct.  Note that that doesn't say ""all customers"" - and they provide NO documentation on what constitutes eligibility.  Prior to COVID-19, the list of eligible customers for home delivery was a tiny fraction of a percent."
I actually got my delivery text while reading this post! I am likely going to delay given all the paint and quality issues. Here's a screenshot of the notification I got while somewhere deep in the replies: https://imgur.com/B4xBfik
" **Jon McNeill**, President of global sales and services left in 2018 and Elon took over responsibility. 

Which is probably why Tesla customer service is at an all time low.

"oh fuck that, this should be sitting on Elon's desk if not taped to the windshield of his car"
"Do they even have one, judging by the stories I hear I doubt it."
"They know how bad it is, if they wanted to fix it it would be fixed by now."
The attempt to stop paying for tows is probably a cost cutting measure coming from above so I'm not sure Tesla is going to change much here. They're probably in hardcore cost cutting mode right now because of COVID19.
Completely agree.
"I'm afraid this is the consequence of rapid growth. When a company grows 100% y/y, half there employees are ""newbies"" at any given time, and there is a reasonable chance that everyone involved in some process is not experienced with the process.
Given that Tesla won't stop growing, these things won't stop happening unless they create better structured processes and documentation."
"This level of ineptitude from the top down of Tesla is why I will never buy one myself, I‚Äôll stick to my turbo diesel station wagon first 

[look how they massacred my boy ](https://youtu.be/pxSQuGeoug8) 

Tesla needs a good wake up call on customer service and quit finger pointing for their own failures"
"Exactly. What's troubling is, Sandy Munro mentioned an individual who Tesla should hire to rectify the shoddy paint jobs. I'm very confident that Elon knows Munro and his video teardown of the model Y. He's have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to see what's going on"
">It‚Äôs amazingly poor support for such an expensive purchase.

This is a perfect summation of the service issues at Tesla. I don't care if they have to hire a call center in Pakistan, being able to call a human being and explain an issue would be infinitely better than the shitty email and hope for a reply system they have right now.

The #1 reason I'm excited for competition in the EV space is because it'll hopefully force Tesla to step their customer service game up"
"TL;DR my car won‚Äôt charge at a supercharger.  Service center checks and says car works on their SC, it must be that supercharging location.  

Email support says that location should be fine, but call while there if I have issues.

Call while at supercharger, all queries go to a recording saying ‚Äúcharging issues are diagnosed automatically, bye!‚Äù with no way to get a human on the line.

Great service. /s"
"Sounds like they're taking a page from Zuck's (face)book. They don't even have automatic support, just a couple FAQs."
[deleted]
"They are growing rapidly.  That means all the different parts aren‚Äôt going to be perfectly in sync.   It‚Äôs not surprising that some people get left in the gaps.    

Tesla is tiny for what they do which is a car maker, all the car dealerships, most of the car mechanics, and most of the ‚Äúgas stations‚Äù.   When you look at it like that you realize they‚Äôre nowhere near a huge company.  They are minuscule.

edit: I get that people don't like bad customer service, but you're buying in to a company that's growing at an astonishing rate.   That's not easy and some things will fall through the cracks.  It will eventually get better, but not until after the growth phase settles down."
"It sucks that the customer service is so bad someone would return a perfectly good car.

Hey, does this mean Tesla has a pre-owned Model Y for sale?"
"I kind of can. OP doesn't know what kinda shit he got himself into now. That's a good bit lost on picking her up and now all the time waiting for refund.

Once it's all said and done OP will be out of a nice chunk of change and no car. It's sad that it had to come to this.

I'm a bit sarcastic in the comment, but I do feel for OP and how much frustration they caused him to get to the decision of returning the car he clearly liked."
"If the first was that bad, I'd wait months before asking for delivery of the 2nd. Maybe even until the next model year. 

Scratched paint is damage during transport, or utter nuts at the factory causing damage to the fresh paint. I hope it's transport damage.

Body panel misalignment is a thing that shouldn't happen anymore, not with the amount of automation and mass production in this stuff."
Can you say what state or country this happened in?
"The cybertruck will definitely not have paint issues.

And panel alignment has to be good or else it wont fit together."
I wonder how they plan to sell a car like that. Ridiculous. Do you got a picture?
"You can ask for a replacement at delivery? TIL. I'm surprised, I saw an article last year that Tesla just disallows you to reorder the same car for a year. Is that only if you return it after taking delivery?

I hope your next Y is issue free."
"Holy shit, decision sealed. No Teslas for us."
I guess workers forced to work during a pandemic don‚Äôt give too many fucks

Sounds like they were a bit noisier than expected for an EV :-)
"I feel I've witnessed the decline. When I took delivery of my 3 in April of '18 the service centers were in great customer service mode, likely used to S and X owners. I had a handful of service items right off the bat and yeah no problem we'll fix it all under warranty and they had it for 3 weeks and I had a sweet S loaner the whole time. 

1 year later, same service center felt different and the attitude was more take a number, and maybe a loaner if the stars align but plan on Uber credits. Oh yeah, and maybe this will be covered under warranty or maybe not. 

6 months ago same service center. Dang it was hard to get anyone's attention and no way to get anyone on the phone. Loaner? Lol, the Uber picks up over there."
"Yeah, my parents had an from like 2014-2017 and the customer service was fantastic. Almost any time we needed maintenance or anything done they would send someone to pick up the car and bring it back even though we lived like 45 min from the service center. It's crazy now to see all these stories of issues with customer service because to my parents that was one the strengths they felt while they had an S."
"The advent of real volume with the 3, big SC expansion, low levels of training, and lack of investment. These imo contributed to the issues."
"I just got back from Mercedes dealership and it was not a good experience. I got a tiny loaner for a large SUV. I had specifically requested it ahead of time, told no problem. So I complained and they found something larger (which I actually needed, normally I don‚Äôt mind small car for commuting). Then they said I might have to pay for the work , like wtf it‚Äôs under warranty. I again complain and I‚Äôm told that‚Äôs standard as they can‚Äôt promise the work will be covered. Ugh so fine whatever but I felt like I got better treatment at the Nissan dealership. The waiting area was meh and had some granola bars ....didn‚Äôt really care but it‚Äôs the luxury equivalent of a rural gas station . Local Tesla ‚Äúdealership‚Äù is very simple and industrial. But I got a model S loaner every time I dropped off my M3. Nobody at Tesla told me I might have to pay cash for my warranty work. (I know it‚Äôs technically true as of course i could have damaged the car through negligence) but overall I‚Äôve enjoyed the experience at Tesla more than Mercedes. I will never buy another vehicle from a dealership."
"didn‚Äôt they used to ferry a loaner to you and then pick up it back up when the drop your repaired vehicle back to you?! regardless of where you lived? my MCU‚Äôs connectivity radio (cell and wi-fi) has stopped working for almost a year now, couldn‚Äôt get them to acknowledge it was defective when it was near a service center, and now it‚Äôs 6 hours away from a SC and they won‚Äôt agree to tow it there since it‚Äôs driveable, and the MCU has been back ordered since November, when they finally agreed to replace it."
"The SR+ which I bought last July has less than 10,000 km on it and the passenger side sun visor is already rattling. I ended up attaching a thin piece of foam core with double-sided tape to dampen the noise of the visor hitting the headliner.

My friend bought a 2015 Toyota Camry with 50,000 km on it at around the same time and there is not one single rattle to be heard. The used Camry was 1/3 the cost of a brand new Tesla. Oh and his window regulator system works flawlessly."
They‚Äôre not a carmaker. They make batteries and put it in a box with four wheels. Their main concern is to play the range game with the batteries and build quality/QA is secondary.
"Tesla will get beat in the long run then absorbed into GM or another major manufacturer. Then cannibalized and end up a shell of the company it started as and eventually go the way of Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Saturn, etc."
"I *almost* regret buying a Tesla whenever i have to deal with service. However, in a sea of bad experiences, i just had a great one in Las Vegas.  The advisor named daniel is awesome."
"We got two Model 3s. One needed service the day of delivery, gave me a loaner and had to replace the LTE card. The other had a misaligned driver door, got that fix a month ago with service but other than that - no issues."
"To be fair, every brand has their share of service horror stories and Tesla supposedly has a very high customer satisfaction rate. Its still bad that cases like this happen and I think OP did the right thing. I hope Tesla improves their service."
"As a general rule, people don't write about their awesome experiences with Tesla because they're boring. OP definitely deserved better but their experience is not necessarily the norm."
This is me. I‚Äôve have mobile service out (no service centre here) about 15 times. She‚Äôs a bit of a lemon.
"These sorts of stories blow my damn mind.  If I had the financial means I'd be very interested in a Tesla except for the lingering impression that build quality and customer service is underwhelming at best.

And as a Ford driver that's crazy to me.  Two years ago I bought a new, completely loaded Ford Focus for literally half the base MSRP of a Model 3.  Yeah the Model 3 is a better vehicle by any objective measure, but the Focus has shuttled me around with no issues whatsoever, providing 80% of the features for 50% of the cost.

I don't know, I guess I just wish I had the luxury of time and money to take a chance on a product that's not cheap, may not function correctly, and may not be made whole under warranty in a timely fashion."
Sucks to hear you had a bad experience. Hearing this really blows my mind since it sounds like a totally different company. I have had nothing but good experiences.
100%
">The percentage of lemons may be low, but they exist.

I'm pretty sure the percentage is much higher than other auto makers*. That's the real issue."
"Like amazon giving a guaranteed delivery date, not shipping it until the delivery date, confirming it will be delivered that day even though it is hundreds of miles away, then saying oopsie we missed the mark. That kind of service?"
"> If Tesla handled customer service like Amazon 

""We're sorry you're not happy with your Model 3.  We've refunded you the purchase price of the vehicle, there's no need to ship the car back to us, please keep it or destroy it, as you see fit."""
Maybe old school Amazon. Current Amazon (even pre covid) customer service has become pretty unimpressive. Still good about allowing returns and such but crap at any kind of shipping issue.
"Have you seen the stock price and Elon's massive payout? He has figured this out. We just have different priorities from Elon.

With the low production volume who really cares? The cars are selling. The hype is there, and even majority of the pissed off customers like their cars and end up wanting more. Pissed off one day, but happy two or three updates later."
Not people.....sheep.
"Hyundai (and Kia with it) is very likely to succeed. South Korea is banning sale of ICE-only cars in a few years, so they don't have much choice."
"Ford Mustang Mach E, while badly branded, does give me some hope. The Mach E is a good looking Y competitor. I'm just wishy washy whether it will have the range or charging capability to really make a difference or just be a lackluster etron"
"It's crazy how they can fuck up such a great experience. Their customers are pumped up and happy. Many things will slide, yet Tesla can surprise us and drive a happy customer to furry."
"He doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about improving their customer service, if he did he would‚Äôve done it by now. It‚Äôs been shit since the model 3 came out and it still shit."
I‚Äôve never understood why people recommend tweeting Elon. I imagine he receives more tweets per day than he could possibly even read in a week so the odds of him even seeing your tweet is extreme low.
He‚Äôs on a Twitter break and hasn‚Äôt been the most stabile voice in the company in recent weeks
"Oh yes, delivery fee was included. I opted to take delivery at the SC in Kansas City, so if there were any issues I could have the addressed right there or easily noted on the account."
It sure was. I had a White Model Y Performance.
"Just read the comments here. OP is not alone, he's just the main story here. Plenty of people could match or better OPs story. I'm glad OP posted, because I thought I may have been a one off."
Gotta tow that bad boy to Seattle
Tesla tries very hard to not put items under warranty.
"I don‚Äôt think the bolts were there any more, based on OP‚Äôs statement that the SC had to secure the piece."
"Yes, they arranged and provided the towing company. I wanted it all to be handled by Tesla because I felt like that gave me the best chance of getting this resolved quickly."
"I wouldn't trust them with paint correction, hood call. You have to be a pedantic professional to fix paint and these incompetent techs replaced damaged panels with damaged panels. It's quite possible that the techs just don't pay attention to the details. Don't let them anywhere near the car with a buffer."
"My model 3 shipped with a deep scratch on the bumper and a scratched glass roof.  SC said they'd call me to get it fixed.. they didn't.. so I booked it in, they sent me away saying 'the paint guy isn't in so we can't do anything.  We'll call you.'.  Of course, no call, so and repeating the process just yields the same results.

That was in August last year.  No call, and there obviously won't ever be.

When I bought my last car from a dealership I found a scratch and they had it in for fixing that day with no quibbles or delays.  

Tesla is just tiring.. to get *anything* done you have to chase them relentlessly and even then you might not get what you want."
Just wait for the cybertruck to hit the road and a whole new wave of owners used to multiple competing dealerships starts to need service on their trucks.
"Was it a Tesla Service Center?

If not, your insurance company is crap and sent you to a shitty chop shop that doesn‚Äôt know how to work on Teslas."
Honestly that's all on the insurance company
Customer service is part of the company. If one is horrible the other is horrible too. It is not a third party.
lol. Are you set up for charging?
"Worst customer service I've ever run into. Had Cadillac, Infiniti, Acura and never run into the kinds of issues that Tesla creates, starting with the simple act of just trying to get in touch with a living person in any kind of timely fashion. It's appalling."
"> Tesla tells their employees to deflect over and over as much as they can.

This is a huge red flag.  Also the way they treat their employees is another huge red flag."
"This mindset seems to come from Musk's Paypall background . ‚ÄúThe best entrepreneurs? They let fires burn,‚Äù  That is if you want hyper growth you can't put out every fire so you have to decide where to direct your resources . Obviously Musk is directing Tesla's energies at  hyper growth at all cost rather than customer service.  But I think there is a huge difference between a problem with a small PayPal transaction on eBay and a 55K car."
"We take delivery of our Y Saturday. We‚Äôve owned our 3 for over a year and had 0 problems. But, I‚Äôm nervous. Any thoughts on what to look for on the Y at pick up?"
"In that case ""I will not consider a Tesla."" FTFY"
I ran into the same thing with the referral code. I ordered about a month ago but no VIN yet. Tried to add a code now and they told me no.
Mobile service is great in my experience.
Let's be honest if you're buying anything but Japanese. And you go european or tesla you're going to have a bad time. Look at Hyundai's engine class action suit.
BINGO!
"I keep hearing this, but my experience has been the exact opposite"
"Honestly, I have heard similarly bad experiences with dealerships, and my experience with Tesla has been flawless. I think that this guy's story is an outlier. Probably more common than it should be, but still an outlier."
Same here. Especially living in Europe where autopilot is very limited and service coverage is even lower. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense for a car that will cost me over 49k‚Ç¨ (about the same as a nice PHEV E-Class wagon).
I am sorry for your experience. Your story is exactly why I didn‚Äôt get an Uber and go to a store to get supplies to tape it or remove the panel. I had no way to confirm that they would still honor it as a warranty item. And it seems like me leaving it as is was how they found that it wasn‚Äôt secured in the first place.
"I'm in the same boat, it's really disheartening reading all the qc and cs issues that I may have to look forward to."
"It speaks a lot about company culture when someone cares more about their own tiny piece of the budget (in this case, the service centre) or performance metrics than whether or not the company as a whole is successful."
"Similar here. Although I love the car (M3) I don't recommend it to family or friends, and the people who ask, I advise them not to buy unless they are willing to deal with an obnoxious company. My standard thing to say is ""fantastic car, terrible company to deal with"".

If you read a lot of postings here that say ""yeah, I had this terrible experience with Tesla, I just ordered a Y"" you can see why they haven't changed ( actually they've gotton worse ). When they have real competition in the EV space, and they are no longer production limited, and they have a widely known bad reputation that causes people to avoid them, THEN we might see them care about improving customer relations. So, maybe 10-15 years from now. ‚òπÔ∏è"
I haven‚Äôt yet.
I had a very very similar issue set and they acted like they were doing my a favor fixing there own mistakes.  I mean what the heck people.
Even the shadiest Toyota dealership wouldn‚Äôt have been this bad. That RAV4 prime is going to be a HOT HOT HOT seller.
"So, interesting fact. The Return Policy States that I am lockout of buying the same model and trim for 12 months. So I would run out of options pretty quick."
"If you took a Mercedes off the lot and parts were falling off of it on your trip home, I guarantee you the dealer wouldn't even think to argue."
Manager at KC service center will be looking for a new job soon.
"Owner was dragging a splash shield on brand new Model Y and had the car towed back to SC at cost of $1k+. Tesla won't pay for the tow. Owner returning the car.

I can't honestly say that if I was handling something like this doing insurance claims (like somebody hit a retread or a dead armadillo or something in the road and detached a shield) that I'd willingly pay for a $1k tow either. Seems a bit extreme for a dangly bit of plastic in the absence of any malfunction indicators lighting up on the dash.

It will probably get paid in the end after some grumbling. You can't assume that the owner has even basic car knowledge at this price point."
Why the fuck are you apologizing for a terrible service experience someone else had at a publicly traded company you own a few shares of?  I regularly swing trade millions of TSLA but I wouldn't give anyone else an apology for their lapse in service.
"They 100% can deliver to my door if I wanted. I chose to take delivery in Kansas City because of all the issues I read. If there were QC issues with panels, paint, and interior, I thought it would be easier to get them noted and potentially fixed right then and there. If they delivered it to my house, I would have to rely on mobile service and figure out how to document any delivery issues."
"There is a panel that is under the front of the car in between the front wheels. I am told it‚Äôs mainly there for aerodynamics and little protection of motors etc. My understanding is that unlike the Model 3, this part is an actual panel, not a composite fiber cloth cover. Part of the piece seemed to be damaged from it not being secured and it was catching air and banging around all under the car when I would drive over 30 mph. 

That issue is one thing. I was more disappointed on how it was handled by Tesla‚Äôs customer service. I felt like this could foreshadow a poor relationship going forward."
Hold up. Comcast is a great product?
"Basically yes. My problem was that I was told if it‚Äôs a warranty issue I will not be responsible for the Tow Truck bill. I then am told multiple times it‚Äôs a warranty issue at the SC, but Tesla refuses to pay the tow truck bill. I then spend the whole day trying to talk to someone at Tesla, find it‚Äôs nearly impossible.

This experience made me concerned about owning the car for 5 years, and being in a state with no Tesla SC started to worry me. I felt like if anything went wrong, I would be at the mercy of the ‚Äúapp‚Äù. I assumed before delivery that I could get responses and talk to someone if needed.

Adding up the service and QC issues ultimately caused me to walk away."
"Totally agree. I immediately asked to be transferred to the right person when Roadside picked up. I was just desperate to get someone on the phone. Interestingly, the Roadside person didn‚Äôt transfer me and handled all my questions and gave me the information about how the warranty and towing is supposed to work."
"Unfortunately, I didn't get that information at the time, and they were unable to confirm that if I attempt to fix it or continue driving that it would be a warranty repair."
"Honestly wasn‚Äôt looking for that, so didn‚Äôt ask. Just expected this to be resolved relatively pain free. Right now, I am without a car and shopping other options."
"It was 200 miles (322 km), that's a pretty significant distance IMO. How much would it be where you are?"
"Yeah, what kind of idiot buys a brand new car and expects to not have to shell out over $1,000 in the first day? r/idiotswithcars right?"
"this - the long sucky story reeked of someone trying to back out of a big purchase  
did someone nagging about the money finally get to them?"
Are they the number one automobile company or are they the number one exclusive electric car company? I remember reading something about that differentiation a few years ago when people were making that claim
"I‚Äôm on my phone so I can‚Äôt be as verbose as I would like, but...

If I bought a car that started disintegrating within 250 miles of me driving it off the lot, I would be paying $0 regardless of the technical description of the type of repair."
"> Re-torquing of nuts/bolts is considered maintenance and isn't covered under the new car warranty. If they were willing to do the work for free that's nice, but it's not technically warranty service.

On a *brand new car*, that's not maintenance, that's a manufacturing defect, and I would *absolutely* demand that be covered under the warranty.  It's super straightforward to resolve.  The fact that they managed to fuck it up that badly is impressive, even for Tesla."
"I totally understand that if the issue wasn‚Äôt a warranty issue that I would be paying to tow truck bill. Unfortunately in this case the service center consistently told me it was a warranty issue that needed to be fixed, so I expected it to be covered under the 500 mile limit you discussed above.

The amount is one thing, it was unfortunate I was getting a run around and unable to get answers due to the lack of back end customer service systems in place."
"Wow, if a brand new car (< 1,000 miles) needs a correction due to faulty or loose bolts, then that should absolutely be covered under a warranty. Crazy that‚Äôs classified as maintenance and not a warranty issue considering the age and mileage of the car."
Re-torquing nuts and bolts on a car after 250 miles on a new car? Lol what?
"Are you serious right now? You're trying to argue *well technically this isn't a warranty item*? Thankfully even their service people aren't that silly, this is a brand new car. Nothing should need re-torquing at the customer's expense.

This type of thinking and attitude is why their service has disintegrated into complete garbage and cost them a return. Someone should have immediately picked up the phone, arranged a tow without even mentioning who would have to pay for it, and then paid for it and fixed it and sent the customer on their way. Anything else is unacceptable."
"So if you drive off the lot and a body part falls off it's not covered under warranty?

Well that's some bullshit."
This is what brainwashing looks like
"I mean, dude, most traditional automakers have an authorized service center every 35 miles

And if nuts and bolts weren‚Äôt properly torqued at the factory and failed in the warranty period, it‚Äôd better be effing covered"
Pieces falling off a brand.new car the day you drive it off the lot is most certainly a warranty issue.
"You do realize that transportation to and from the service  center is referencing the Tesla transportation, not after you've picked it up. When they hand you the keys, it is ""delivered"". The ""at your expense"" is the money they charge you to transport it from California to your local service center."
"even the TLDR was too long.   
If his calls to TSLA were like this I understand why they were unhelpful"
"Or, and hear me out...

it could be that a company that has a known and well documented history of having production quality issues especially with new models is once again showing those issues with a new model. The sudden group of stories could be because deliveries of the Model Y only started in March and have only just restarted after shutdown."
"You‚Äôd be fine with being stuck in another city paying an unnecessary $1100 bill for a *brand new* $60k car that they‚Äôve essentially taped together... because the car is cool?

OP said he loved the car too, but it doesn‚Äôt excuse Tesla from having poor procedures or contact points in place to address issues."
People like you who let Tesla get away with stuff like this are actually putting Tesla in danger of going under. 3 of my family members canceled their plans to buy a Tesla after seeing my chaotic service experiences.
I‚Äôm pretty sure the thing that wasn‚Äôt bolted on coming loose was an issue with his series Y
"I cant believe he wrote so many words about such a boring story.   
Did his wife force him to return it?   
Or did he really hit something on the freeway and cause the damage?   

Who knows, who cares, but i""m glad that guy doesn't have a tesla."
Sounds more like shitty processes and unclear competencies. If there was any issue caused by Covid they could have said so.
Their service and internal communication were this bad long before Covid.
"I have been a long time reader, but finally made an account when I was going through the ordering process as I planed to post on the r/teslamodely subreddit about it taking delivery. I will link a photo of the return declaration for proof if needed."
Are you suggesting the return declaration that he attached is fake?
Just tweet this story's URL to musk.
"I don't know if this will mean anything, but I had a similar experience where Tesla refused to pay for my tow truck. I don't know if it was because I posted the experience on Reddit, but they eventually pulled through and made it right. Hopefully it works out for you!"
"I read a forum post by some guy here in Norway who spent 6 weeks to sort out a refund. He didn't hear much unless he asked for it and meanwhile he lost money to interest on his loan and to insurance.

It's probably being processed, but it seems Tesla really suck at keeping their customers in the loop."
Email him at erm@tesla.com
It could take up to 45 days. I‚Äôm sure they are processing it.
How about now?
"I read a comment to tweet to Musk. I think InsideEVs would be interested in this. If they do a story, they may reach out to Tesla for comment. You may want to try that approach.

Thanks for sharing the story.  As a side note, I live halfway between the Toledo and Cleveland SCs (about 1.5 hr drive) and they send a mobile tech for most things. First the spoiler originally intended for my car needed to be installed post sale as they were trying to beat the Federal tax credit expiration for the original owner. Second was to perform a service bulletin on my seat that felt a little loose when accelerating. 

You probably would have a service person come to you if you try again...  I'd wait until the inventory from around this lockdown period is well cleared out."
You should just tweet at Elon he‚Äôs answered and escalated before with bad situations.
"Dude why would it take 30 days?  They owe you the $1,100 too - get an attorney don‚Äôt lay down for them."
"I think you made the right decision, for a technical standpoint. The cars they release next year are going to start having even better batteries... I think."
"They grew too big, too fast. I have a friend who used to work for them and years ago, right before the X came out they had amazing customer service at his center. I spoke with the manager, trying to land a job there and some of the things that he was authorized to do in order to keep customers happy blew my mind. Vouchers for hotel rooms, entertainment and meals were all on the table. The techs were all hourly and so if there was a priority vehicle and it took more than one of them to repair it efficiently, so be it. Everything was done with hand tools as well. Air tools weren‚Äôt heard. It was truly amazing, although unsustainable. This was the only Tesla dealer in a town of 2 million people and they were getting by in a shop with maybe 8 bays. 

Years later I revisited them when talk of the 3 started. I joked that there was no way they would be able to stay in that location. Those cars will be everywhere. The same manager told me that Tesla wants to keep their service centers small, with little overhead and so he didn‚Äôt imagine them moving. Well, they did... and into what used to be a furniture store. Wrong. That place is overwhelmed all the time and I can‚Äôt imagine them being able to provide decent service to people. There‚Äôs just not enough space or manpower. They‚Äôll get it right eventually as long as the money is coming in. I hope they do. It‚Äôs an amazing car."
"For me I don't expect a high level of service, but who has time to deal with this kind of thing - if you are earning good money your time is usually stretched SUPER thin. 

So for me I don't need to be treated nicely - brisk, efficient and rude service is fine. I've got a third party mechanic who delivers that for my non-tesla vehicle. Same day or overnight service. Drive in, talk to coordinator, speak briefly with owner who looks at car, then I'm out. My info is all on file tied to plate - so it's real quick."
New MX owner here and completely agree.
"My attempt to buy a Model 3 LR AWD back in February was the second worst customer service experience of my life.

My purchase of a Chevy Bolt a week later was the smoothest and most painless vehicle purchase in my life.  I can't say ""smoothest customer experience"" because Amazon Prime has the first few hundred places of THAT award, but definitely smoothest vehicle purchase."
"I‚Äôm seriously eyeing competition I‚Äôve had my m3 performance for just over a year and I love it to bits but I have been to the service center/mobile service 9different times over the year. It‚Äôs an hour away on the other side of Orlando (I‚Äôm not the worst situation of people on this sub but still really annoying) soonest appointments are always minimum two weeks out, they don‚Äôt fix the issues always and have to schedule another apt, and like it‚Äôs still the best car for the money but I don‚Äôt have time to deal with this. 

Really making me consider dropping Tesla for peace of mind on the future."
I love my car so much. It‚Äôs the best car I‚Äôve ever had by a large margin but every second of working with the SC was painful for me and the staff was severely incompetent. There‚Äôs almost no communication through the purchase process and no way to reach out and talk to someone. I hope I never have any technical issues because the experience has been great ever since I got the car.
"Just from my own experience, it's not so much they don't give a shit, it's more things are lost in everything and there's not enough training (or power), incentives on how to properly handle these things. I'm very sure that people within the company do absolutely care but because of unclear boundaries and instructions, these people have to really go out of their way and that cuts into other areas such as productivity, etc."
"I also had a fairly bad experience when I purchased my car. I love the sales model Tesla has, not having to deal with sleazy auto dealerships and weasely salesmen. And I was initially so grateful to not have had to go through all that nonsense. 

But this wasn‚Äôt a shining example of the alternative. 

It seems to me they need to start from the ground up on their customer experience process."
they gave you the *wrong* car? Story time
"And the most important part: If you don't live in the middle of nowhere, you can go and choose a different dealership if yours sucks."
"Did this behaviour propagate up the chain of command? I can't imagine that being tolerated at senior levels, but can imagine an awful middle manager encouraging this.  

Conversely,  I can imagine that if lower staff felt fear from upper management  (to hit arbitrary targets, etc.) that they may feel pressured into such nasty techniques.   

Either way, I hope you were able to be part of the solution when you resigned, and let the seniors *above* your boss know what was going on."
"Wait, you made enough salary to lease a Model S but you decided to leave the company because of a service center issue? Who would be so upset over a service center issue they would leave a company unless they were in management of that center? Were you management of that service center?"
I will bet it is ineffective.
Don‚Äôt you think Elon has more important things to do than manage this? Pretty sure there are staff at Tesla responsible for such things.  Not everyone demands his attention.  It‚Äôs a bit like Karen asking for the manager.
"Yup, and more recently I‚Äôve been pretty over Elon too. Love the car but with as much ‚Äúcash‚Äù TESLA has on hand, they need to invest that into customer service. Motherfuck logging all the issues through an app"
"I called Ecobee support the other day for a smart thermostat.  I got through to an expert overseas after about 2 minutes who stayed with me until my issue was resolved. He knew the product in-and-out and took the time to make sure we had it perfect. 

Tesla needs a leadership change in the customer service department."
"As much as I want a Tesla, I‚Äôve been holding out for just this reason. I know that I have a low tolerance for poor service, so I‚Äôm better off admiring the company as a spectator and investor."
"Recently drove the KIA Niro EV for a couple of hours. Was blown away by how good it was. I'm a big fan of Tesla and the tech but for regular people this is a serious alternative.
The one I drove was the ""premium"" one and it's only $45.000 in the US.

Edit:
Not trying to push KIA here, was just a response to Tesla's shoddy quality control and customer service to up their game to be in line with the great cars."
Holy shit no. I would much rather email someone than have someone in Pakistan play middle man
"Sounds a lot like my insurance company when I called them....

Their robot: ""You can now file your claim online. We emailed you a link to do that. Go and do that. Goodbye!""

Me: ""But.... a tree fell on the house, and it took down the internet line with it. I'm not going to spend a few hours on coffee shop wifi trying to upload photos to your website.""

Their robot: ""I. Said. Good. Bye!""

Fuuuuuck that. And at least in that case, they would need damage photos to be uploaded online, either by me or their agent/adjuster."
"‚ÄúMusk moves some things around‚Äù. You realize this is a publicly traded company with a large accounting team and laws? 

They make profit and the profit is reinvested . They need to realize the necessity to reinvest it into service."
"The idea people have about the way accounting works are so fantastical. You can't just move accounting entries around to present things the way you want. If you are referring to selling ZEV credits to make money, then I'd challenge you to show why that's not a legitimate part of Tesla's business. The whole point of those credits is to put the EV makers on par with the ICE makers while battery prices drop. 

Also, on an operating basis rather than a pure accounting basis, Tesla made money in full year 2019 even with the bad quarters. 

https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/29/business/tesla-earnings/index.html 

https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/13/business/tesla-profit-outlook/index.html"
"This is indeed common in many industries, in particular tech. It‚Äôs cheaper to let many people have bad experiences and instead use that money to grow. 

It‚Äôs an awful practice that should be vocally opposed by everyone. There is no excuse for it besides pure greed. This is not a 100 dollar thermostat, it‚Äôs a car that can cost as much as a house in many areas."
Well maybe not a perfectly good car . . .
Haha... not pre owned... paperwork bit filed so it will be a new car palmed off to another ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù
Maybe once they finally get around to fixing it.
Yeah after the model 3's launch I wouldnt trust tesla until 6-9 months after launch
"> I hope it's transport damage.

It must be. Seriously. Not saying that every painted part leaves their factory in perfect shape but I still think that most of the huge damages are from transport."
"In theory, the Y is a lot of the same parts as the 3 so I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be this bad but I had heard of their QC issues. I was prepared to walk away if it wasn‚Äôt up to par."
Princeton NJ
"Well, that‚Äôs my fallback option. I don‚Äôt need a car. Just want a Tesla."
I guarantee you someone picked it up right after me. I have plenty of pics. Do I need an imgur account to post them?
"I believe that‚Äôs the case but I just said I‚Äôm not taking it, get me another one."
"Don‚Äôt overreact jeez... we have a Model 3 and we wouldn‚Äôt buy anything else.

You can always refuse delivery or return it after 7 days."
"It‚Äôs not a reason to not buy it, I just want it right. I‚Äôm in the vehicle business and if I delivered something like that, I‚Äôd get lit up!  But when you‚Äôre not a ‚Äúdealer‚Äù, per se, it doesn‚Äôt affect a small business the same way.

I‚Äôm giving them a chance to get it right...I love the product enough to do so. But don‚Äôt expect people that have owned high end cars to do the same."
"There are plenty of people that choose to keep their life as normal as possible. This has nothing to do with the pandemic, just people that don‚Äôt give a shit about quality work."
Cashflow is a bitch.
"To maybe bump up the stock price? Idk if they can get cars on the road sooner than expected that‚Äôll definitely help the stock price. The covid shutdown would‚Äôve been the perfect excuse to miss Model Y production dates. They could‚Äôve used the lessons learned from Model 3 ‚Äúproduction hell‚Äù to do the Model Y production right. A few bad quality cars for your first time mass producing a car is acceptable but if it keeps happening with every new launch, it will negatively affect the brand image"
"So just like my model 3 which came with loose bolts all over my suspension that I had to bend over backwards to convince techs over multiple visits to take a look at even though, and I quote ""they sound too high to be coming from the suspension"""
"This happened because they changed leadership and made some questionable choices about how that was handled. I know they are trying to come back from it but some of the bad stuff is now ingrained and hard to fix, plus the cash flow issue makes making sweeping changes difficult at the moment."
I think they fired a lot of the customer service people at some point. That definitely harmed the experience.
"> Loaner? Lol, the Uber picks up over there.

I still don't get why would anyone think an Uber can be a valid substitute. For getting to work - maybe, but for anything else - WTF?"
"Similar experience as an ex S owner. The SC in Montreal is overwhelmed and way understaffed. People try their best but they are visibly tired and maybe a bit jaded now. Back in the S/X days in 2015-2017, service was always a good experience. Now it's really hard, some days impossible, to get someone on the phone."
That's the difference in selling 90k vehicles a year and >500k all across the world...
They'll buy a $300m tool but wont put that kind of money into their employees. Business 101. Remedial business for non business majors.
"Completely right, they just buy that box and four wheels from magna or someone right? Oh wait they make it themselves?!

Not sure what point you're trying to make here. Companies are motivated by profitability, yes. But that doesn't mean that profitability has to come at the expense of everything else, including good long-term customer retention via customer service."
"But they don‚Äôt build the battery cells, right? They just build the battery packs."
"Are Tesla making their own batteries now? I was under the impression that Tesla weren't up to that point yet and are still buying batteries from Panasonic.

Tesla do have patents for a bunch of automotive parts like steering wheel assemblies, automotive glass, and powertrains though.

I think it would be more accurate to say that Tesla make a box with four wheels and then buy batteries to put in it."
"Is the long term goal to sell to other car manufacturers then?

Like a ""Powered by Tesla"" logo increases the value of a Ford because we all know they have the best batteries of anyone?"
"So give the design, battery, software, and Autopilot cameras to Toyota or Honda and let them choose the part suppliers for things like window regulators and sun visors. And let them grace the car with their second-to-none QA. The car would look the same, but just be slapped together with far more attention to detail.

Sure I'd probably have to pay another $10k+ for the improved quality but it would be 100% worth it.

My parents have a 2009 Lexus LS460 (bought used for less than half its MSRP) and despite being 11 years old it feels brand new in terms of fit and finish. When you sit inside you can really tell that the Tahara plant in Japan knows their stuff. Imagine if Teslas were built at the same plant with the same staff?"
"If this ever happens I hope Geely would be the buyer.

Imagine Volvo build quality with Tesla tech and batteries and superchargers? You could call it the ""Polestar Tesla""."
Man ive received service so bad I actually regretted buying a Tesla too. That‚Äôs crazy how a poor service experience(s) can ruin the trust between consumer and corporation
You think so? I‚Äôve had ok customer service including an advisor lying to me about fixing a very small paint defect at delivery. I love my model 3 but I would definitely consider looking elsewhere for my next car because of the poor customer support experience.. My $33k  Toyota has better customer service for reference.
"And to your point, ask any owner about their car and you‚Äôll likely get a few horror stories too."
"Yes, that‚Äôs an excellent point.  I‚Äôm not here to bash Tesla.  Because I would like one.  I‚Äôm just hesitant."
"This is exactly what makes me regret not returning the car. For the price of my M3 I could've gotten far better quality with less flash and 50% the cost, like you said.

Teslas are sweet and very fun to drive, but people really need to know that you are buying into a beta test with minimal customer support."
Had that happen once and I went to chat and was immediately refunded. It took 3 months to receive a $1000 refund from Tesla. Only reason I got it was because of persistence on my part.
I especially enjoy when they quietly update all those dates to make it seem like it was always scheduled to be delivered a month after you purchased it.
"this is not the norm for amazon, though. they are very customer centric."
"That sounds like DHL to me (in Germany), with Amazon Logistics I didn't have that experience, yet. But I get your point: It's not like Amazon has a perfect customer service. They are just very easy on refunding stuff that's broken or doesn't work properly. Or if something was missing, ... Oh yeah, at least if it's not THEIR product. FireTV, Amazon Echo etc. - if you ever had the fun to call them for problems with these problems, well. Endless questions (""Have you tried this, have you tried that; now reset the device and call again if the problem persists... no no, that reset a month ago is too long ago""). And their ""expert"" usually reading that guideline the first time.

I'd put it that way: Amazon doesn't have a good customer service, they are simply very easy on refunding. And their customer service just isn't as *horrible* as many others. I wouldn't say, that's a positive thing, right?"
"Second that Amazon will refund you essentially no questions asked. I was staying at a hotel and a shipment missed delivery - apparently it was due to confusion in USPS. Refunded - no questions asked. The rep even told me if I was able to somehow get the package delivered later I could keep it. In many cases Amazon won't even ask you to return products when you actually try to return them. They'll just credit you the payment and let you keep the item. It sucks for 3rd party sellers from what I understand.

I've had this happen several times and I honestly tried to send them back the items each time and I was told not to bother. This actually led me to keep some products I planned to return because I felt guilty just getting a credit and keeping the item."
">Like amazon giving a guaranteed delivery date, not shipping it until the delivery date, confirming it will be delivered that day even though it is hundreds of miles away, then saying oopsie we missed the mark. That kind of service?

Or when you check on a status of an order and it will say something along the lines of ""DELAYED.. CHECK BACK BY x DATE AND WE WILL REFUND YOU OR RESHIP THE ITEM""... and everyday you check that date is pushed by a day... wtf is the point?  

&#x200B;

The only luck I had was screenshoting it and when the day came in the screen I got Amazon support to reship it.. got two and they didn't ask for one back!"
I really don‚Äôt think that is sustainable. Terrible support can do damage to a brand.
"Kia is already implementing ""micro hybrid"" motors to its cheaper cars. I think they'll go full hybrid in 5 years and full electric in 10."
He likes to move on to the next project and forget the past. It's all Starship now that Crew has flown. Same with Plaid and Truck
"If enough people and the right people tweet something at him, he definitely see it. There‚Äôs this Tesla Community on Twitter, and he‚Äôs very connected to it."
That break last like 2 days.  He has tweet since then.
"what are the odds, it was a snap chat so I don't have the picture.  Essentially said ""looks brand new?!"""
"Yeah, I'm one of those as well. I haven't documented it anywhere, but I'm still dealing with issues that never quite seem to be corrected (looking at you rocking driver's seat). I think I had a sum total of 5 service visits to get a creaking door fixed (and in the process they broke the window regulator) and many more that resulted in no actual fixes. That's also excluding the flat tire they replaced, but ripped the bead on installation, requiring another service visit to remedy. At least that one they fixed without argument at no cost to me.

It's frustrating -- it's almost impossible to speak to anyone unless it's face to face, and even then, you get the sense that most employees aren't empowered to fix anything that lies outside their very small area of responsibility. I'm a firm believer in the fact that if you could just have a conversation and a little employee empowerment that most problems could be solved. As someone else mentioned -- just having someone listen and actually try to solve problems (Amazon, AMEX) goes a long way toward earning my respect and repeat business.

I hate it, but I've often found that the only way I can get anything addressed is by being ruthless on the follow-up surveys (when they're sent -- which is not always); then, and only then do I usually get the attention/escalation necessary to get solutions in place.

And this isn't limited to the automotive business -- I had the same experience with solar/powerwall after the fact too.

I really hope they figure it out. I've spent a lot of money with Tesla and I genuinely love the products, but I also can't recommend that anyone else buy them any more, and I even took my own advice and bought a non-Tesla a few months ago for our most recent vehicle purchase."
"I mean there‚Äôs one in Spokane, but it‚Äôs a 418 mile trip by road.

Independent workshops better be able to repair this thing, because if my truck is gone for two weeks in Spokane, or if it‚Äôs towed because of an apparent warranty issue and they try to stick me with a $1500 tow bill, I‚Äôm going to drive it through the door of the Tesla showroom"
"Almost nothing is covered by it, it sucks."
"Really? I'd think that there is no way to deny that a part falling off the car within a few hundred miles isn't a clear warranty issue. Unless they can show significant damage that caused the problem. Then yeah, it's an argument with the maker, and they may not see logic. I remember the stories of the glass roofs cracking on their own, with Tesla claiming it was road damage or vandalism - up to the moment that a YouTuber caught it happening on its own, on camera.

I'd be tempted to finish yanking the piece off the car, put it in the trunk, and take it back to the service center with the claim that it finished coming off on its own. At least that would save the hassle of the tow truck. It may ruin that piece of the car completely - but IMO that's Tesla's issue. It partially fell off on the highway, expect it'll get damaged."
"""Within spec"""
That honestly makes the situation even worse.
"Was not a Tesla service cent. It was an ""approved Tesla body shop"" there were no service centers in my area during that time. Partly my fault for buying the car and living no where near civilization."
"Agreed,  it's still with lawyers over a year later. I was also told by the shop that I was unreasonable and that they would no longer work on my car. ""it drives and that's all it has to do""    didn't matter that my center console was installed crooked and audibly rubbing against the driver seat. Didn't matter that their techs ripped a leather seat and totally ruined the plastic on the inside of the doors.  Didn't matter that the rear end rattled like a train going down the road.   The whole thing sucked! And driving back and forth 6 hours just made it worse."
Yep. Had Infinitis for years (before buying Teslas). Service experience across multiple dealers across multiple states light years ahead of Tesla.
I have no doubt they will improve. Just haven‚Äôt seen evidence of that yet.
"Or find someone you know that works at Tesla, or connect on LinkedIn, and inform them, maybe it works maybe not"
"Yep, I felt the same way.  I guess this is a downside to not having a dealership model."
"With the 7500 tax credit, it almost seems like a no brainer to me. The idea of no engine maintenance sounded nice to me."
"Then clearly the answer is to buy diff models and trims. Buy the standard+ 3, return that cuz it doesn't have enough bass. Buy the premium. Return it because too much bass. Buy one with aero wheels. Return becuase too much aero. Then get the big wheels. Return bc wheels too big."
They probably wouldn't want to get caught up in lemon law litigation.
"Lol, if that were true it would be nearly every service center."
Makes sense.
"FWIW, all of my experiences with mobile service have been awesome."
"Yeah, that really sucks. Seems like it would have been simple for them to quickly bolt it back down.

I've had my own issues. The front passenger seat was damaged by some kind of chemical (presumably someone was sanitizing the car for touchless delivery and spilled something).

I explained this and it still sat in service for 3 days before they finally admitted they need to switch out the seats.

Car also did not come with a charger. I realized this before leaving so they just handed me one that was clearly used (even has hot glue on it). I asked them to replace it with an actual new one and they just ignored it."
"Bummer. Sorry to hear about your mess, what a shame.  I have a 3 and its been perfect and a Y on the way for my wife.  I have always had amazing service and support."
Not entirely sure. Normally it would be covered by the insurance. I doubt very much it would exceed a few hundred ¬£ at most.
"I mean I wasn't there, and I know having it happen on a new car is really annoying, but having a few clips come off your plastic underbody shield is a pretty garden variety car issue. If you own any car long enough, one must be able to deal with these things. Zip ties, duct tape, just pull the thing the rest of the way off.. take your pick. OP went down a long unnecessary road of ""will it invalidate my warranty"" when the conversation they have asked themselves is ""can I affect a repair that will be cheaper and quicker than the other options available to me""."
My thought as well - it sounded a little petulant.
Number 1 . Consumer reports.
"Consumer reports. #1 overall.  

(Obviously they're the number 1 EV company lol.)

https://www.consumerreports.org/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/car-brands-ranked-by-owner-satisfaction/#:~:text=Tesla%2C%20Genesis%2C%20Porsche%2C%20and,easier%20to%20have%20consistent%20satisfaction."
"OP did pay zero dollars for the repair. But since it‚Äôs not technically a warranty issue, roadside assistance, which is a completely separate unit from service, can‚Äôt cover the tow. If it was $30 they almost certainly would have done it, but an $1,100 tow bill is fucking insanity, especially for a trip under 200 miles."
"They DID cover the repair, according to the poster. But the point is that it‚Äôs technically NOT warranty service so the roadside assistance doesn‚Äôt cover the tow. It‚Äôs a separate department and they were following the rules, regardless of what the service guy said."
"I‚Äôm just quoting from the warranty. Take it up with Tesla, don‚Äôt shoot the messenger."
"I‚Äôm not arguing anything, I‚Äôm quoting directly from the new car warranty. It‚Äôs also no different than other car manufacturer warranties.

If people don‚Äôt like the warranty terms that‚Äôs understandable, but downvoting me or yelling at me over it is pointless. I didn‚Äôt write it."
"I‚Äôm quoting directly from the Tesla warranty. I‚Äôm sorry that people don‚Äôt read these things, but don‚Äôt get mad at me for pointing it out."
"It was covered in the sense that they didn‚Äôt charge for it. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it was an actual warranty claim. For roadside assistance to get a call from that service department saying they need to pay an $1,100 bill for work outside of warranty coverage, it‚Äôs understandable that they balked and there was confusion on who would pay it. If it was $50, not so big a deal. But like I‚Äôve mentioned elsewhere, an $1,100 bill is massive and given the fact that it was less than 200 miles it‚Äôs way above even the highest national rates per mile."
Go read the Tesla new car warranty. It‚Äôs very clear in the Repairs section that you are responsible for getting the vehicle to and from the service center for repair not covered by warranty. You‚Äôre talking about the initial delivery of the vehicle which isn‚Äôt the issue here.
"I would sincerely hope not. Unless you have personally dealt with them, 

Have you ? üò¨ care to share your story ?"
Just include a polite summary so it doesn't immediately come across as spam.
"Yeah, I'm sure he reads everything people tweet at him."
"That no longer gets anything.  At best you'll get someone claiming to be a regional sales manager, who will claim to want to help, but after 3+ months of trying to give him and Tesla the benefit of the doubt, will not have achieved anything, likely due to lacking the power or authority to actually do anything."
Why? I doubt he cares much about customer service. It's not a priority and doesn't do much for sales. If the time comes that customer service is important then I'm sure Elon will address it. OP isn't a one off.
He‚Äôll reply by calling OP a pedo
Of course it was :(
"I had a similar problem in 2018, where Tesla took my trade in, gave my my new car but never paid off the old one. Took several months of yelling and talking to everyone I could reach to get it fixed.

Honestly the only thing Tesla has going for them is the tech. There's no competition, and their customer service has been horrible in recent years."
Can confirm they suck with refunds. I put the deposit down to order the model 3 but pulled out later on. Getting the money back took three months.
I get the bank loan part but why would anyone continue paying insurance for a car they don't have and can't drive? That one seems like it's on him.
Still nothing from Tesla. I will update the post if I hear anything.
"Yeah, I've had my model S since 2014. In the early days it was full white glove treatment. Very nice, very accommodating, very personal. Really like a luxury brand. 

Not so much anymore. I haven't had any bad service center experiences, but I also haven't had the same caliber as it used to be. Which I understand. There's just not the profit margin in the 3 to support that level of service for that number of people. 

But it did get pretty tough when they went full-automated with their service appointments. The only people who know anything are the service advisors and techs, and they're basically impossible to get a direct line to, by design."
"> They‚Äôll get it right eventually as long as the money is coming in. I hope they do. It‚Äôs an amazing car.

If people will tolerate poor service because the cars are great, then poor service will most likely continue. 

Business thrives on *adequacy*."
You‚Äôre right and I agree. My point is that Tesla service is both shitty and inefficient.
"Completely agree. It isn't about the money either, I just hate having to give up so much time and feel like I am in the wrong for expecting this expensive car to just work and be normal. I think we will probably go for another provider unless they get their act together. They proved it is possible to have a long range electric car with performance, if they would just get the quality things figured out then it would be a no brainier to stay. Our car was rushed through production so much that there are clips and push rivets missing everywhere. The paint is also shit, chipping around the doors and they even repainted the bumpers but didn't reinstall them correctly and broke some clips, so it hangs off on one side. They can never fix the seat or bumper at the service visits cause ""no parts"". Not what I expected from a ‚Ç¨65k car. Our S4 avant was ‚Ç¨60k and was so much better quality wise, and came with winter rims and tires....."
This is crazy to hear. I purchased through the Charlotte area Tesla center and they were great to deal with every step of the way. Highly suggest them if you are somewhat in the area.
"They've had plenty of time to sort this shit out. 

Make my words. In a few years there will be some real competition, backed by companies with good customer care and follow up. Then they'll be in trouble.

I've seen other companies go through it. Eventually customers get fed up with it. 

They only get away with it because it doesn't hurt their business. The Y that got returned? They've probably already sold it."
"Hear, hear! I had a similar experience. I had some ‚Äúagent‚Äù call me for about 60 seconds once I finalized my purchase but he never followed up. Fast forward one month and coronavirus hits. I was expecting an April delivery but since the Fremont factory was shutting down my car would be delayed. 

Suddenly and without warning I was sent a random text in mid-March telling me my car was ready. I could either take it now or wait until June or later (when the Fremont factory reopened). I hadn‚Äôt secured a parking spot in my building nor did I have insurance, so I had to scramble to sort all that out. I love the car and the delivery went well but the customer experience up to that point was not what I‚Äôd expect from purchasing a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù vehicle. 

I have no idea wtf the ‚Äúagent‚Äù who initially called me does for a living but I want that job. Sounds easy."
Incompetent is a great word to describe Tesla Service.
That was my experience as well.
"The variability in service centers is fascinating. Tysons Corner, VA SC has been amazing on all fronts in my experience."
"There were definitely some people there who did care. 

The woman who did my walkthrough came to me after outside and apologized. She said she's worked for Tesla for 3 years and never seen such disregard for customers.  

She was definitely speaking off the record."
"So you are saying they don't give a shit enough to fix unclear boundaries and instructions. Either way, from the customer's perspective, the company doesn't give a shit."
It would have helped if they didn't fire a bunch of people from their sales and customer service staff a year or two ago....
"Well thankfully I noticed before I drove off.

I go to the SC and they bring my nice shiny white 3, very excited. The SC rep matches the VINs to the paperwork, I do the registration, pay my money etc. 



She does the run through of the car, all good. She leaves me for a few minutes to finalize the paperwork and I notice something weird - it says is 90% or something but only 250 miles. If a range is about 310, shouldn't 90% be nearly 300? 



When she comes back i asked her, and she's concerned. She goes out the back for 10 minutes, comes back and tells me it's the wrong car. 

I wait another hour for them to get the right car, and when they do bring it out the seats and door sills are covered in a glue like substance. 


It then takes them two more goes of taking it back and cleaning it.

There are also some paint chips in the door sills on both sides which the manager tells me are normal and 'they're all like that'. 

I take him over to the 'wrong' car, and show him that no, they are not all like that. 

He refuses to do anything, and says I can refuse the car if I want."
"This is important, good point. I thought the same applies to Tesla as well, but switching service centers wasn't a major change. I went from a sad place to a mediocre place.

My original SC of choice was one of the first Model S showrooms and now it looks run down and like it hasn't been maintained since the glory days."
"I was in a unique situation where my feedback, among a select few others, was collected in a weekly call and sent to VP+ level. This decision, among others, was from the very top. Despite the feedback, and extra workload (as customers had to call sales since service was unable to pick up the phones), the system remained the same. It was felt, and communicated, all the way to North American sales leaders."
"Man, everyone is lower staff and they all work together to minimize costs. Service is not a priority."
"That's not why I left. I said that was the straw that broke the camels back. Go back and look at the issue people complain about in the subreddit from 2013 onward. Now magnify that by 10 as I'd have to deal with those issues in person. There were MANY decisions made by management, or Elon himself, that patched a near-term issue, without much consideration to longer-lasting impressions. Much of that had to do with customer service. I ultimately left because they changed my compensation, reducing my income by 60% overnight."
">	Don‚Äôt you think Elon has more important things to do than manage this?

This entire post shows that he definitely has more important things to do, given that customer service is terrible. But how will Elon learn about this problem? Should we tell customer service? Apparently that doesn‚Äôt do anything. :)"
If this was important Elon would have addressed it and resolved customer support issue. It comes from the top. There is no pressure and likely no budget to provide better service.
"Great CEOs and leaders care the most about the customer. They are not too high and mighty to be doing more important things.

Sure there are supposedly staff in charge of such issues but they are either not doing their job or more likely, since OP couldn't actually get a hold of someone to talk to, there isn't someone who can deal with this.

Either way, CEO is still eventually accountable for all successes and failures of the company no matter how big or small.

Elon's job is not specifically to solve this specific issue but know that such blatantly bad customer service is happening at his company and fix it systemically."
"You got your meme in, jolly good for you.

So the entire point of the post was that either OP or the service staff (allegedly) couldnt find anyone to talk to to resolve the problem while he wasted his time and PTO trusting them to be anything more than utterly incompetent. Pretty sure that means there are not staff at Tesla responsible for such things, and if there are, they suck at their job. But yeah, Karen, ok boomer, whatever."
Frickin Get a call center at minimum so people can actually talk to someone.
Ecobee is fantastic at support.  They are far better than many companies.  Tesla would do well to even get halfway to the standard Ecobee sets.
"Same here. I really like the Y, but it is too risky a purchase for me. Many of my friends have Model 3s, but they‚Äôve all had some kind of issue, some including a bricked car because of a dead battery. I can‚Äôt drive around worried that something might go wrong, not when I‚Äôm paying that kind of money."
What insurance company do you have? So that I can avoid them.
"I think they're commenting on Tesla's tendency to save up then sell carbon credits to offset losses. They've done that several times to push earnings into the black for a quarter. It's not fraud like the commenter kind of implied, but it obviously doesn't reflect their sales nor is it sustainable and they have historically used it as a way to drive up near-term confidence when they're in need of another round of funding.

So yeah, they were a little disingenuous up there, but they're not completely wrong. The fact that they are still in a rapid growth phase and likely will be for some time will make it difficult for them to expand something like customer support in any meaningful way."

"There's likely no other way to create a car company from scratch and is consistent with their goal of accelerating the advent of sustainable energy. 

That's a much more noble goal than trying (and failing because it's impossible) to keep every customer happy."
You can‚Äôt sell it as new with 250 miles on it.
"They aren't allowed to do that legally. They may still do it, especially if they were behind on all the paperwork, as if things aren't filed yet then nothing is in government systems. The only way for anyone to find out is if the VIN is made public and the next owner catches it. Then they'd need to take Tesla to court and there could be a battle over if it counts as a ""new"" car (by all logic it's used - in fact, it's really kinda returned as a lemon which would make it an instant salvage in some states. But the maker may claim that it's not *officially* used because they just didn't bother to file the paperwork. But that's like saying someone isn't officially dead because the death certificate isn't filed yet. They're still definitely dead. Tesla can't/shouldn't magically create value via their poor paperwork)."
"Misaligned panels, pushed in sensors and a dirty front seat is not transport damage though. Something's going on."
Who in their right mind would pick up a car in that condition. But I fear you are right. On Imgur no account is needed to post (single?) pictures. You can just upload it and get a link.
Which bolts?
That definitely makes me look forward to my delivery .. damn I wish they would care about quality control.
"When you‚Äôre the ~~most~~ *second most* valuable auto manufacturer in the world ~~(by far)~~ yet produce less than 500k per year, you should be able to find the money to take care of your relatively small anoint of customers. Imagine Tesla‚Äôs market cap to customer ratio compared to literally any other auto manufacturer."
Exactly.  And they haven't even come close to selling >500k vehicles in a year.  Imagine how much worse the service is going to get!
"He means their focus and talent is in the battery and the the computer, and they treat the rest like a cheap appendage just to finish the package.

After this going on for so long it seems like their end goal is to be capable of manufacturing a shitload of exess parts and sell them to other car makers."
I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you. It‚Äôs just obvious to me that they prioritize tech over car.
"It would make sence, they would make far more money and reduce a huge amount of cost and manufacturing issues if they stopped making cars but sold the power trains to other manufacturers.

The power trains is the good bit, the actual car bit is uttershite."
"> Had that happen once and I went to chat and was immediately refunded.

Exactly my experience. Just that it doesn't help if you relied on the guaranteed delivery. Also, as soon as your problem can't be solved by a simple refund, you are just as screwed as anywhere else ;)"
"Yea say what you want about Jeff bezos but he is the anti musk when it comes to customers service, the single biggest reason I buy off amazon is the amazing service you get."
"He is the one is charge, he has been happy for there shit costumer service for years though."
"Sure was, had 279 miles on it at that point."
"""Within tolerance"" 

Ugh, kill me."
">I'd be tempted to finish yanking the piece off the car, put it in the trunk, and take it back to the service center with the claim that it finished coming off on its own.

That's exactly what I would've done.  There's no way on earth I'd have been so inconvenienced in a brand new vehicle over something that didn't actually affect its functionality.  Rip it off, toss it in the trunk, schedule a warranty repair at my convenience."
"I agree, but they will try generally."
"No, not your fault at all. Just another reason why Tesla has to extend their service center coverage."
The sounds painful. Things will be better with your Y
They also wouldn't want to look like a horrible company that does not give a shit about safety or their customers. This could have killed someone.
I'm guessing you don't live where he does.
"And how familiar are you with Tesla motors? I only ask because I live in a town with just under a half million people and there isn't a single shop in my town that will touch them. Protecting that warranty isn't a big deal with a specialty vehicle that can only be worked on in a handful of locations is a little different than worrying over a loose radiator cap. If a quick fix on the first day voids a warranty and ends up costing you thousands of dollars more, then that brand might not be a quality brand."
"We get why the shitty customer service people acted shitty, but it was their tow guy and it‚Äôs their car which failed.  Not anyone else‚Äôs fault that Tesla doesn‚Äôt have sufficient warranty repair centers"
"My point is that it's *absolutely* warranty service, and you eat the charge as the company because, in theory, the people working there aren't mentally retarded.  I am never sure when it comes to Tesla though."
it's a message the babies in here dont want to hear
Any other manufacture wouldn't try to pull any bullshit and argue technicalities on a brand new car. They have people staffing their support departments that know that is completely unacceptable. ESPECIALLY when the customer has a 7-day 1000 mile return window that they can just use.
"I‚Äôm not mad, sorry for the tone of my comment. We all want Tesla to succeed. It‚Äôs not really whether it‚Äôs in the terms or not, it‚Äôs more about whether this was a good customer experience. Good experiences will help Tesla do better. If they don‚Äôt fix this they won‚Äôt survive in the long term. Growing pains are part of any company and bringing this stuff to attention will help them figure it out."
"Not anyone else‚Äôs problem, that‚Äôs the provider Tesla contracted with and it‚Äôs their job to negotiate rates.  And if Tesla doesn‚Äôt have sufficient warranty centers to minimize these bills, well, they‚Äôre going to need to pay the tow bills and not whine to their customers about it"
"I have and I have. Check my comment history circa winter 201i_2019. It's too long to rehash.

I love my model 3 though."
"Like most heads of company, he's got a team that takes care of his social media presence. They will bring it to his attention if it needs it."
"Not everything my guy, just this post."
"unironically he might, he's nuts"
"You do know that anyone can read any tweets, tesla, spacex, boring's marketing teams, customer teams, social media teams and legal teams all probably keep an eye on social media..."
Well. I tell everyone that asks that I think my Model3 is a great car but they should stay away from Tesla because their service sucks. I live in Norway where everyone and their grand mother are looking into buying an EV.
"I had a terrible experience with them regarding my trade in. I had to trade in my car and still owed money on the car and they rushed to get me the car so fast and my guy kept saying don't worry about it we'll just take the car and figure it out. It was only like 3K. I contacted him and someone else about it and they told me they would get back to me about it. Never did! So I just let it go. Like six months later someone finally emails me and ask me if Tesla owes me money. I'm confused and like what? So he asks for my previous loan info so he can check on it himself. like three days later I get an email from him threatening me that they will take away my car unless I pay this new balance in full right now. I'm like wow, that escalated quickly. 

He acts like a complete dick when I contact him and he says that I've been hiding and did I really think I was going to get away with not paying Tesla their money. I tore him a new one over the phone. At this point I demanded his Superior and then his Superiors Superior. They were legit ready to tow my car in two days from anywhere they would have located it. So I talked to the Head boss lady and she calmed everything down and we took care of it. I asked her how can I file a complaint against this guy and she said honestly they work in three different departments in three different locations and she wouldn't know how to do anything which obviously was complete bullshit. They can have some real assholes working for them that's for sure. I wrote an open complaint on here and on the Tesla forum and sure enough she called me back to discuss and make everything easier for me and apologized and said they screwed up. 

Someone. Reads. Everything."
"Not in Norway. You can't legally cancel insurance as long as the car is registered with valid license plates in your name, Tesla hadn't transfered registration to them so he couldn't stop insurance. Insurance companies won't let you cancel insurance unless someone else has insured the vehicle or the license plates are turned in. Hard to do that when Tesla has the physical vehicle."
"All they need is one educated and capable person....I used to work in a major call centre and dealt with complaints...tried to teach staff but with me having 14 years experience with the product we were selling i could never teach them everything they needed to know.....i was offered multiple jobs by a few big banks and other financial institutions but did not ant the pressure at that point in my life.

If Tesla had to hire people like me they would see service complaints drop dramatically, they will eventually but is suspect it will take a lot more people returning there new cars within the first few days of ownership to get there attention."
"That‚Äôs what concerns me about the more affluent buyers that have the money to throw at Ss and Xs. The Porsche, BMW, Audi, Mercedes demographic is used to the level of service you expect from a $80k+ car, where they wait on you hand and glove. Granted, we have a Model 3 on the way which is not even close to that price tag. But the level of CS we‚Äôve received has been worrying. Not responding to emails? I‚Äôd expect better from a Toyota dealership.

‚ÄúAdequacy‚Äú works great for businesses that don‚Äôt have to bother being competitive until the money stops flowing in. But if you‚Äôre a smaller business or an upstart with competition, you‚Äôd better distinguish yourself somehow or you‚Äôre done ‚Äî customers won‚Äôt tolerate mediocrity. Underinvesting in customer service was a cost-cutting decision that has gotten them this far with Model 3. They‚Äôre fortunate they have a great product, but from the horror stories I‚Äôve heard here, I wouldn‚Äôt rely on their CS to save my life."
"Yeah I agree. I don't need to be offered coffee and have my sneakers complimented. Just do right by me, my time, and my very expensive purchase."
"Sometimes I regret not going with the Audi S5 sport back. I really like the package that Tesla offers though, I love autopilot, safety features, electric drivetrain and performance, so idk but I‚Äôm open to the competition depending on if they ever get their act together on the service department."
That‚Äôs where I got mine. I‚Äôm glad you had a better experience!
"Same in cincinnati.  They are great.  Most of communication is through text, but it works well and they follow up"
"Yep.  I by no means would imply their customer service is stellar.  Certainly communication (both internally and customer-facing) are their Achilles heel, now and for at least a couple years now.  It was amazing that they managed to grow so quickly, but that growth undoubtedly came at a price.

Having said all this, there are still locations that, in spite of the internal issues, manage to take care of customers quite well consistently.  I'm just glad my local SC is one.  I also wish more people would make clear which locations these experiences happen at - they need to be named specifically if there is any chance of them actually getting the attention they need to improve (in addition to fixing the internal disconnects)."
"Yeah, I‚Äôve had people ride in my car and say things like ‚Äúwow, I didn‚Äôt know it was so great, why don‚Äôt they advertise?‚Äù My understanding is that they‚Äôre selling them as they make them and I don‚Äôt think they could meet demand if they started advertising. People put up with it because it is a great product when it works and there is an expectation of trouble when you‚Äôre an early adopter (although I don‚Äôt know how much longer people will feel like early adopters or if they even still do). 

I love my car, I hope to own Tesla‚Äôs from here on out if they keep leading the way but I dread having to deal with the company/service issues."
"> Make my words. In a few years there will be some real competition

I generally agree with you, but the above comment is something I have to respond to.  I've been hearing this for going on 5 years now.  In that time I placed reservation on a 3 (4+ years ago) and taken delivery (2+ years ago).  I've yet to see a more compelling vehicle - the only other vehicle that came close was the Y (2 years later) and, to a lesser extent, the Bolt.  I was by no means dead set on one over the other - they were just one of only...two(?) options at the time for a longer range EV < $50k.

I fully welcome competition in the EV market at the price point of the above vehicles, but at nearly any price point, the competition has been sparse and the press releases touting the next best thing largely have yet to materialize.  Eventually it will be true, but it's become almost laughable how often we've heard about ""real competition""."
"competition is good for the customers. I'm eager to see how Ford handles their new line, customer service wise, and some of the other up and coming small brands. Cool tech only gets you so far; The older i get, the more I appreciate quality and good customer service."
"TBH, I think it's actually likely that car service quality will continue to decline industry wide especially as independent mechanics get driven out by OEM service centers. Also with fewer mechanical issues and more electronic and software issues on electrics there is a lot less incentive to put effort into support when blindly swapping parts and paying me $300 Uber credits saves them money on having phone support.

I'm getting a sensor or the airbag fixed on my 6 month old  M3 now and it's been there all day with no update and no one answers the phone. Same thing happened on my paint/bumper fix due to a big scratch at delivery. 

It actually parallels my PC support experience lately where companies would rather me send parts back for speculative warranty repair than spend 15 minutes on the phone to verify my issue."
"Unfortunately real competition is still a ways away. Traditional car companies have been far too lazy with technology innovations. By time they catch up to what Tesla has now, Tesla will still be 5 years ahead. Not to mention the supercharging network is what makes Tesla's viable for long road trips. I'm hoping the Ford Mach E is at least decent enough to start to steal some business from Tesla and force them to move in a different direction."
"The second the big players finish refining their models, Tesla's going to be hurting. They've alienated way too many people in a market they expected, for some reason, to be able to corner. You can't be the Apple of cars if you're coming in 160 years late to the party.

They've innovated so much with electric vehicles and batteries, but holy shit they've really not done much with it."
"You could look at it like that, but I personally believe it came from multiple areas (e.g. lack of bureaucracy), but not badly intentioned. I do agree though that they should emphasize more on picking up the slack/reduce issues or be able have clear effective channels of communications in like OP‚Äôs situation. While the system is effective for the vast majority, really enabling customer support and care wouldn‚Äôt hurt long term goals imo."
Meanwhile in other parts of the world: Choose between a 1h30m drive or a 4h drive to the next alternative SC :p
"Oof. That is not a good sign, at all."
"Yeah like Autopilot bugs, these issues are so prevalent that it's clearly not a case of someone needing to be made aware.  They know, they have to know."
The only thing Tesla VPs do is sit and vest.
"Yeah, don't blame you if they screwed with your salary. Was just curious because it's hard to discern how isolated the kind of stories OP shared are vs owners who never have to contact service at all."
" *I ultimately left because they changed my compensation, reducing my income by 60% overnight.* 

You got fired, you just don't know it."
I would like to think he has people close to him reading these threads and bringing them to his attention when they are worthwhile.
Maybe find someone else in the company?  There are more exec there than just Elon.  Might have a better chance of getting traction.
"Good customer service is important, and should definitely come from the top.  Elon dealing with each and every issue on individual cars makes no sense though."
"Ya, I do agree with him dealing with customer service as a whole.  He can and should address that.  Having said that, I also hear stories of people getting great service so maybe it's regional?  Regardless, we seem to agree that him dealing with one car doesn't make much sense."
"Yup. I once wrote a direct email to Jeff Bezos' (his email address is public), after I had an atypically bad customer service experience with Amazon Italy. This was a Friday evening in Seattle, and by late morning Saturday Italy time --just hours later -- when nobody there works, I got contacted by the head of Customer Service for all of Italy. She said Bezos asked her personally to solve the issue, which she did, immediately."
"So next time my Amazon order doesn't show up I guess I should take it straight to Bezos?  LOL, moron."
"I can 2nd that Ecobee is amazing, I had a tech that I emailed pictures to, that I was on the phone with the entire time. He walked me step by step on how to wire a thermostat perfectly just by looking at a picture of jumbled wires. Tesla on the other hand, hot mess of trying to reach an actual person."
Does the Ecobee automatically build your schedule like the best? Or is it just a thermostat that you can control from your phone?
"I wonder how many more cars they would sell with just a bit more investment in customer service. Maybe as capacity continues to ramp up they‚Äôll do it. I have a BMW 640 and I‚Äôd like to make the move, but not just yet."
"I would wait a model year on a Y because you should never buy a new model car from any brand, but suggesting that 3s are just bricking as a common occurrence is over the top. I mean it's a consumer reports recommended car with reliability in the top segment of its category. If you would drive around worried about something going wrong with a 3, you should be equally or more worried by nearly every other brand."
"I'm not sure if I'm allowed to mention them explicitly, but it rhymes with ""BallState"" and they promise that they have good hands (to strangle you with)."
"That's fair, you weren't questioning the accounting per se, but I do see that commonly suggested on here. As a tax accountant, it always bothers me to read that because there really aren't any tax plays to shift things around that aren't outright fraud. From a business decision side, a company can complete transactions in a certain quarter to get a quick hit of income (like selling ZEV credits), but (1) that represents real income, and (2) most analysts aren't looking at ZEV sales when they analyze operating margin.  

The other funny thing is most companies love being in losses (at least for tax purposes) because then they don't have to pay any taxes. So it's always funny to see Tesla trying to eek out a profit just to say they did."
"Tesla has a free pass to fuck customers over spending 50k+ on cars because you think they have some noble goal?

Man you fell for some marketing hard buddy. There is a big difference between ‚Äútrying to keep every customer happy‚Äù and doing the legal minimum to not get sued.

You can be a fan of EVs and think we need more of them and still say this support is unacceptable."
"As long as it hasn't been titled yet, I'm sure it can be considered 'new'. Many dealerships sell test drive vehicles as with that many miles on them."
"There are tons of new demo out there... some are demo most are returns or rejects.

Great way to get a deal"
Really bad quality control
"Pushed in sensor? Typical damage after accident.

Dirty front seat? No way the factory workers have dirty cloths. The transport truck driver, though? Much more likely.

Misaligned panels? Yeah probably from factory. But maybe the Tesla really was in an accident at the transport and was poorly repaired afterwards? I don‚Äôt know. Not likely, still an option."
"Well, they used touch up paint to cover the issues, expecting me to take it that day, so an unsuspecting (next) buyer might not even notice those issues. 

Maybe they don‚Äôt care about panel alignment either. I‚Äôm sure it was sold. 

I‚Äôd post a pic but don‚Äôt know how that works here."
"Top hats were loose, and there were various other bolts including those for the lower control assembly."
As someone who worked in an automotive factory it blows me away that the important bolts are not torqued to spec with a robot or automatic torque wrench.
"Tesla isn‚Äôt the most valuable auto manufacturer, and how much you‚Äôre worth doesn‚Äôt say anything about how much money you have."
"The service will really hurt their ability to convert the more casual crowd who just sees cars as a Point A to B appliance.

This crowd is used to driving Corollas or Civics and getting Toyota or Honda standards of service. How do you persuade them to switch to a more expensive car and get Jiffy Lube standards of service?"
"Unfortunately everything else would be trash because the infotainment, dashboard, connectivity, etc would still be stuck in the 00s"
"The Amazon products that get delayed are the ones send by a third party, and still the customer service is incredible. I bought a phone just when all of this Covid thing started and it never arrived, I'm patient so I waited for 1 month. After that I called and I was immediately refunded and was given a 50 bucks gift card and a 10% coupon on my next purchase from the same category. Tesla can't deliver parts for its own damn car?"
Elon doesn‚Äôt care that much about the customer service unfortunately.
"What a small world. Unfortunate, tho best of luck on your future cars tho"
We already established they don't care about the customer at this point.  They just want to avoid having to pay more later.
I'm as familiar as anyone - former Model S owner. I think you are overestimating the ability of an automaker to void your warranty.
"Ok but my post is quoting the warranty where it pretty clearly seems to indicate this isn‚Äôt a true warranty claim. 

Of course it made sense for the service department to eat the (minimal) cost of the repair, especially since OP took delivery of the car from them. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs actually warranty work. Roadside assistance, a completely separate department that is responsible for the towing portion, isn‚Äôt going to eat an $1,100 bill because some service tech made a verbal mistake. The rep who takes that call and pays out on a bad claim, when it‚Äôs such an abusive high tow bill well outside the national average, probably gets fired or at least reprimanded. Because of this, it‚Äôs easy to see why there was confusion and it took a minute to figure out who was going to pay."
"I 100% guarantee you that Ford would not pay a $1,100 tow bill for a repair that isn‚Äôt covered under warranty. Even if it was covered, they would probably dispute this bill because OP got ripped off big time. The highest end cost for towing nationally is $4/mile, and he was billed $1,100 for a 180 mile trip, in Kansas, one of the cheapest states for services in America?"
"I agreed with OP that it was a bad customer service situation. I was just pointing out that it happened because the service tech was completely wrong about it being warranty work, while roadside assistance knew better and was sticking to the rules because they‚Äôd get holy hell for approving an $1.100 payout on an invalid claim."
"Note that OP said the tow truck driver was inadvertently under the impression Tesla was paying in full for the tow. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he jacked the bill way up thinking they wouldn‚Äôt even notice. $1,100 is like $6/mi which is completely out of line with even the highest national rates."
"Thanks, I laughed so hard at this that I woke my partner and both dogs up so now I have to ""take [my] stupid phone out to the couch"". That guy's social media presence is an ongoing train wreck and the train was transporting adorable orphans, puppies, and nitroglycerin for some reason. If he has a social media team managing his online presence, I assume it's a bunch of frat boy interns paid in Jaeger, blow, and weed. Remember when his ""team"" got him investigated by the SEC?"
I can confirm there is a very large team at Amazon that does this too for emails to Jeff.
The question is if there was anyone in the past having a feeling that this really helped? Anyone had suddenly being contacted by Tesla etc.?
The big boss of Cloudflare looked into a seemingly minor (but annoying) issue I had.  Just take the chance and send out a tweet. You never know.
"> Like most heads of company, he's got a team that takes care of his social media presence.

Do you have even a single source for this, or are you just saying it because it's plausible to you? Because if that's the case, I think it's not cool to present speculation as fact.

In my view, there is zero evidence from his social media presence that he has a team managing it in any way whatsoever, and I would be rather surprised if I found out that such a team exists."
"He's too busy to read Twitter. Sometimes he reads replies to his own tweets, but haven't seen any indication of an active team behind his account."
Paying people to sift through every public post about the company is an extremely inefficient way to run your customer service.
"Nice to hear that this is a global problem. This means that it is inherent to the company culture and comes from the very top. Simply put, Tesla is not putting enough resources into customer service. Until reading this thread I thought that maybe I was unfortunate to have bad SC in my area."
"Damn, that‚Äôs a dumb law."
"I don't think they'll care about a few people returning their cars as long as they continue being able to have it sold to someone else within the week. The reality check will come when, eventually, another company gets off their ass and actually comes out with a decent competitor EV. Then Tesla will probably lose a lot of customers due to their shit service."
I disagree. Coffee is a must. Coffee is life.
"Oh no! Maybe I got lucky with a (slightly over)enthusiastic experience worker. Was very attentive and emailed and called back very quickly. His name was Chad, highly recommend him!"
"The problem is their service issues, and their actual willingness to help. Customers can understand that the car isn't as well assembled as a Mercedes. Customers can understand incompetence at the service center. Ultimately customers won't accept being kindly told to fuck off like OP, myself, and many others here."
"> Yeah, I‚Äôve had people ride in my car and say things like ‚Äúwow, I didn‚Äôt know it was so great, why don‚Äôt they advertise?‚Äù My understanding is that they‚Äôre selling them as they make them and I don‚Äôt think they could meet demand if they started advertising. 

[Lex Augustine IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine%27s_laws): If you can afford to advertise, you don't need to.

Also, Tesla are effectively in the electric supercar business. They don't need paid advertisements because they get lots of free press due to the nature of the products they sell, especially up-coming halo products like the Roadster and the Cybertruck.

I suspect that their long-term play will be to become a vertically integrated driverless taxi company, and limit vehicle sales to the high end (i.e. at a price-point calculated to exceed the NPV of the taxi revenue sacrificed by a sale). This limits the need for both advertising & customer service in the maintenance domain, because that will all be handled internally in the medium to long term."
"I think now more than ever things are changing. There is large investment, and lots more regulation globally.  

Question is, is Tesla far enough ahead that others can't catch up?"
"Blackberry and Nokia said the same, and so did Microsoft, one reacted and survived the others are a shell of their former selves.

When you feel inevitable, thats when you are most at risk.

EV adoption is less than 5%... plenty of room for others."
"I originally put in an order for a Model 3 LR AWD.  It was a complete and total nightmare, a week after cancelling, I bought a Bolt.

Advantages of the LR AWD:

Fast, Supercharger network, longer range, adaptive cruise control

Advantages of the Bolt:

Picked up at my front door by sales guy, service center is 10 minutes away instead of 3 hours, heated steering wheel (exclusive to S/X), eyes-forward display behind steering wheel (exclusive to S/X), $25,000 cheaper out the door, and $10,000 cheaper out the door than the cheapest ""non-secret-menu"" Tesla, rear cross traffic alert (not available in any Tesla), blindspot warning in mirrors (not available in any Tesla), easy access to parts, easy access to service manuals, non-electric parts (suspension/wheels/tires/brakes/etc) shared with other non-electric vehicles, can use standard jacks and jackstands suitable for pinchwelds and not an exotic Rennstand (I've seen a grand total of two jackstands on the market that allow safe maintenance of Tesla vehicles)"
Uhh ok
"There are definitely extreme outliers that require escalation. Many customers did have issues, but not the majority, nor to this extent. Each service center/sales center is different. You have groups that care immensely, and will do whatever they can, and groups who do the bare minimum. But for the most part, employees cared, but may not have had the resources to resolve."
"Actually, they implemented sweeping compensation changes to all sales staff, reducing the amount of bonus/commission by a significant amount, while raising base salary only a small %. Many, many good salespeople ended up leaving. It was a time where Tesla needed to succeed, and costs > everything. As a result, nearly all of the top performing salespeople around the country left around the time I did."
It has a schedule.
Not many more because they‚Äôre selling all the can produce.  At least for now.
"I pointed that out as just one example among several issues. I didn‚Äôt intend to say that bricking is a common occurrence. My concern is not about something going wrong, but echoing the concerns of OP and the comment I replied to."
"Dude got his money back.   He didn't get ""fucked over"".

And yes, some things are more important than a person's car-buying experience."
"Yes, but they arent sold as new."
"Yeah, or a handheld wrench with an output for the process control system. That's how I have seen similar setups. Assembly can't even continue until necessary torques have been measured."
"Ah you're right, Toyota is still worth slightly more, despite having 20x the output.

Market cap has everything do with how much money you can raise and at what rate.  There's no financial excuse for this level of poor customer service."
"Nah I absolutely hate the tesla system, it's the most awfully designed, bland, uninspired piece of design I've ever seen in a car.

I'd take a fiat 500 interior over that any day, at least its got some character. A car isn't just a tool, it's got to have a soul."
"> Tesla can't deliver parts for its own damn car?

That's obviously not funny or acceptable.

> immediately refunded and was given a 50 bucks gift card and a 10% coupon on my next purchase from the same category

Well, that definitely doesn't happen at Amazon in Germany. At least I've never heard of something like that. Only had the experience that after waiting a week they said ""well, we need to wait another X days until we can refund"" (that was a long time ago) and more recently ""ok, we'll dispatch the same thing again, if the other one does arrive at some point, just deny it"". And I got a free month of prime added to my account. But last time after something was delayed, they told me they are sorry, they are not doing that anymore. Meh. Great ""guaranteed"" delivery date if nothing happens when they miss that guarantee. For quite some time DHL was just incompetent and so Amazon simply missed that guarantee all the time for me. But now they started their own Amazon Logistics delivery service and surprise, I actually get my parcels at the guaranteed days."
">  Roadside assistance, a completely separate department that is responsible for the towing portion, isn‚Äôt going to eat an $1,100 bill because some service tech made a verbal mistake.

That's a lot of words to say the same thing I did:  Tesla fucking sucks at this.

No reputable company would have this issue because they recognize that the fuck up is on them and they need to fix it."
"I 100% guarantee you no brand selling a $60,000 car would pull any bullshit like this. Other than Tesla, of course. ""Because they're a software company"" selling vaporware software."
"Still Tesla‚Äôs problem, and still their contractor"
"Id be amazed if he doesn't have people read tweets addressed to him, or at least use a service that finds patterns or repeats tweets to him and highlights them. There are a number of services that do that, mostly using AI and whatnot to recognize new things that gain traction, or whatever else. It is a great filter to remove one-off fanmail, random unimportant mentions, and summarize hundreds of similar tweets into a single 1. Saves tons of time.

Though some CEOs genuinely read tweets themselves and respond. But I think they often use a secretary or PA to do a basic first-round filter to remove any hatemail, spam, etc."
"They filter the incoming, not what he‚Äôs sending out."
"He writes tweets, yes. That doesn't mean a team to read them doesn't exist."
"Musk's twitter is a trainwreck, yes, but that doesnt mean there arent other people at Tesla that trawl his @s for possible issues. Theres got to be _some_ people in the company with a head screwed on properly -- you can't control Musk apparently but theres plenty other things to be managed"
Umm any chance you know where my friend can apply for that job?
you can prove me wrong by showing evidence of contrary
Most large companies have a social media response center. Why are you wary that Tesla doesn't?
"He at least has a publicist, he‚Äôs a celebrity. Whether that involves a whole team who knows, but yes he definitely has at least one person involved in his social media presence. Just because they manage his presence and engagement doesn‚Äôt mean a person or persons has control over what he says publicly."
"I just assumed he has a notification set to ping him anytime Tim Dodd tweets him, üòÇ I swear there is real bro love there."
Can't you read English?
"Not really. It's to ensure that every registered vehicle is insured at all times which certainly isn't dumb. Tesla could have easily fixed that on day 1, but put it aside for several weeks instead of taking a few minutes to do it right away."
I was saving to get a tesla but the new bmw EV looks so much nicer....I love tesla but from all the issues customers have had i am very wary right now......
"I don‚Äôt remember my guy‚Äôs name but it was tough because he wasn‚Äôt in the store half the time so I kept getting bounced around. My main issue was that after placing the order I never heard from anyone in person again. I would call the store and wait on hold until someone finally answered and they knew nothing about my order, then I tried to call Tesla corporate and through the phone tree would get rerouted and finally sent back to the store. 

Even when I went in for pick up my advisor was there and he introduced himself to me like I didn‚Äôt just buy a $50,000 car from him a week before hand. 

They moved my pick up time slot which was annoying because they sent me an email and it said click here to schedule your pick up time but there was only one time slot in the middle of a work day. The SC didn‚Äôt know if I would be able to change it so I moved some meetings around only for it to be rescheduled for the next day. When I showed up to get it, I had to wait over an hour before being helped. 

The kicker was when the guy finally brought me to the car he said ‚ÄúSo do you need any training or are you good to go?‚Äù So I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know what I don‚Äôt know, why don‚Äôt you just walk me through it‚Äù and then he laughed and said I‚Äôll be fine. 

I was happy to get out of there but also freaked out when it started raining on the way home and I had no idea how to turn on the wipers. 

Like I said, I love the car but I seriously doubted the purchase while I was at the SC."
You're Chad aren't you?
"The thing is, I can‚Äôt understand the lack of care in these cars anymore. You can‚Äôt sell me a $90000 car that comes with problems and bad customer service. You won‚Äôt retain those customers as they are used to the very good service of real luxury automakers. It is no longer excusable. You are no longer ‚Äúearly adopters‚Äù. It is unacceptable."
"I used to work for a big software company where we had two critical features no one else had for server protection (2000's) and we knew it. Some customers would leave due to our high cost but then invariably come back. Then we started adding India tech support. At first it was to ""enable"" follow the sun support (24/7 contracts). But over time India support became the only Frontline line support unless you paid a lot and required US support (govt regs, etc.). Some IT folks were smart of course and found ways to get escalated quickly to ADV teams or backline that were US based but the bottom line is that the initial complaints were being heard by India tech support. 

While we never got the quality of Frontline support back up to where it had been, the bigger issue IMO was that in the US we lost vision of the 'common' complaints. We had a homegrown ticket software (another domino in the failure cascade) that was not good at capturing tags or commonalities so we had to go off of weekly discussions. And one critical diff between the US and Indian culture is the perception of power distance. I won't bore you with the details but the bottom line is that the Engineers in the US suddenly lost real insight into what customers were truly upset about. Management acted like they could supplant it with numbers and reports but the techs knew that was BS. The system was broken and a few of us could see the end of our dominance was coming. We no longer had our fingers on the pulse of the customer and we were destined to smash into a wall while blindfolded (I've got this corp speak DOWN). 

As long as Elon stays in charge, Tesla might be able to avoid this path. But if they don't improve their support culture and make it part of their DNA then this will be their destiny once Elon steps down. It happened to Eckerd's (Walgreens kicked their ass once he died), it's happening to Apple now, and I would bet it happens to Tesla once Elon isn't calling the shots.

Companies are only truly great when their founder infuses the culture with essential core edicts. I highly recommend the book Good to Great if you want to learn about the concept more (it's very evidence based but infused with good stories too):  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_to_Great"
"The same was said, by other manufacturers directly, many times over at this point.  Like I said, while I welcome such a development and actual options in the marketplace, I'll believe it when I see it.  It's happened enough times at this point that I view any press release about a new EV with a healthy dose of skepticism."
"No one is ever so far ahead that no one else can catch up, at least not technology-wise. With certain things, where you need marketshare to develop an ecosystem and an ecosystem to develop marketshare, it can be the case."
"That depends on if they keep innovating. A lot of companies have been so far ahead of competition that they relaxed and became obsolete (remember Blackberry).

So far it looks like Tesla is still full speed ahead and they have a huge lead to work with but there are smart people and deep pockets in other companies as well."
"In self driving tech, 100%. The only thing remotely close that I've used is Super Cruise from Cadillac, and it's pretty bad in comparison."
"Yeah, Tesla is certainly not beyond reproach and there is room for competitors.  That's kind of the point.  Despite that, it's been years of promises about competition, most of which hasn't yielded many viable alternatives for consumers who would love other options to consider."
"I'm glad you like your Bolt.  As I stated, I did consider one but it was not the choice I made, especially as many of the advantages you point out do not make a difference to me.  So I waited just a couple months more for the 3 and have had no notable issues with my 3 in two plus years of ownership."
People get fired for all sorts of reasons. Doesn't mean you were a bad employee. Good luck.
"The Nest monitors the temps you set and when you‚Äôre home and away and automatically adjusts your schedule for you. 

You can manually adjust it but you typically don‚Äôt have to."
"Tesla has enough cash to improve customer service, I agree. Unfortunately they rather build a new factories than improve customer service..."
"I guarantee you that the roadside assistance programs of any other car company - Ford, BMW etc - would not just eat an $1,100 tow for service not covered by warranty. In fact you can go read the roadside assistance rules for those companies on their websites and they explicitly state they only cover tows of around 50 miles or less for non-warranty work. The Roadside rep that takes this call and agrees to pay when it‚Äôs not covered, given how expensive that bill was, probably gets fired.

Technically speaking, the service department should have eaten the tow since it was their mess up, the car was from their facility. It‚Äôs therefore understandable that there was confusion about who should pay. I don‚Äôt fault OP for getting spooked by what happened, but it‚Äôs an unusual set of circumstances and therefore understandable WHY it happened."
"Well prove your case and go read the new car warranties for other brands. If you find any that cover these kinds of expenses even outside of warranty service, please let us know. Otherwise, quit treating this like I‚Äôm the bad guy for pointing out the facts."
"And they did say they would pay for it. They just couldn‚Äôt figure out which department was responsible. OP was asking them to pay the driver right there on the spot so they had to hash it out while he waited. He got impatient and returned the car over it. I guess it‚Äôs understandable that this situation made him realize how far he was from a service center, but it‚Äôs not reasonable to return a car because they needed time to resolve an unusual billing issue."
Which is understandable. They have better things to do.
"Why don't we ask him? 

My hunch is that he doesn't have this team, and just replies while on the porcelain throne."
"That means he read it. And there were incidents where he cared. Anyway, it's worth a try. Not my car, not my money, not my time :) it's OP's decision. 

Frankly I hope my car doesn't die until such issues are fixed with Tesla."
"No, the burden of proof is on you, because you're the one who made a definitive statement. If you had simply added a word making it clear that you were speculating, (*e.g.* ""he's *probably* got a team""), while I wouldn't share your opinion, I would have had no problem with how you expressed it, but, as I said, I think it's not cool to present speculation as fact.

 When someone makes a definitive statement, I believe it should reflect definitive knowledge. Otherwise how can people tell the difference between a fact that they should take on faith and a judgment call that they're entitled to disagree with?"
"Tesla has its own social media account, and no doubt a team in charge of it, but the conversation was about Elon Musk's personal Twitter account. I see no reason to believe that he has a team in charge of it.

That said, if your personal judgment is that Elon Musk probably has a team in charge of his Twitter account, I respect your opinion. What I don't respect is people going around presenting their opinions as confirmed facts. That's misleading and deceitful."
"> he definitely has at least one person involved in his social media presence.

Why do you say ""definitely""? Do you have a source for this, or, again, is it your personal assessment?

I agree that he probably does have a publicist to handle various things for him (like media inquiries), but that doesn't mean that his publicist or anyone other than Elon Musk himself is involved in his social media presence, or ""manag[ing] his presence and engagement"" there. (If there *is* a person like that, I certainly can't see what he's managed...)"
"I get the idea, but there are so many edge cases like this one where it would become an unnecessary hassle. I can understand making it illegal to drive an unregistered or uninsured vehicle, but *forcing* someone to pay for insurance as long as their car is registered? If your vehicle breaks down and can't be driven how are you supposed to go and turn in your plates?"
"I definitely won't get one while I live in a region that has no service centers. Not a fucking chance I'm going to do a daylong road trip to a service center just to deal with crap like this when I get there. But I can't afford one right now anyways, so that works out fine."
"You didn't just buy a 50k car from him. He's just an employee.

You buy a 50k car from a dealer. In Tesla terms you bought it online and went to the warehouse to pick up your product."
lol! Well played but I am not
"It's easy, Tesla cars are in high demand. They basically sell themselves. The company isn't making much profit so priority is given to development and production. Sales and support are an afterthought. Think about it for a minute with the 90k car. You want it don't you. Do you have a Merc that you want more?"
It‚Äôs not happening to Apple now. You lost me there.
"I think at some point Tesla will realize this. I wonder if it will be under Elon though. How long is he going to be interested in Tesla? I think cars are just a project for him and he's achieved a lot. AI and autonomy will keep him interested, but I don't think running a successful car company is his priority. Once the ground braking goals are achieved, Elon may move to more challenging endeavors."
"It‚Äôs happening. The first wave of competition tried to make everyday consumer vehicles but they were too expensive to compete with cheap cars not cool enough to compete with luxury brands. Now Tesla has shown that you can call a cheaply made car with no comforts ‚Äúluxury‚Äù and charge big prices if it seems cool. The actual power train and performance isn‚Äôt groundbreaking for an electric car. The big players like Porsche, ford, bmw, etc are making true luxury cars with the electric technology and a far superior service and sales network. 

On top of that, other ‚Äúcool‚Äù producers are popping up (I‚Äôm contracting at one right now) and will be hitting markets soon. Tesla‚Äôs niche is quickly disappearing."
"Good point. Complacency kills companies, and there's a lot of that on the customer service side."
Is it that bad? I watched a few videos the other week. Having all those lights shouting at you didn't seem like a great experience.
Mostly set by schedule though there is a smart learning feature in the more expensive models. I only needed hold mode and app control.
"And they'll continue to prioritize factories over service until they stop being able to match every car with a buyer before it even leaves the factory, and stop being able to resell returned cars within a week of being returned. From a business perspective, it makes sense - if their supply can't meet demand, why would you focus on support over getting more supply? I just hope that their problems don't become too big to fix when they finally get their heads out of their asses."
Those manufacturers don't have to send a car 250 miles because they don't lack service centers for hundreds of miles at a time.  The tow is long because Tesla doesn't have a wide service network.  That's a problem entirely of their own making.
"I'm saying that their customer service would take care of the situation without even bringing up the idea that the customer would be on the hook for it, and without so much difficulty contacting the right person.

That failure of customer service is why OP returned his car, and good on him for that. Hopefully SOMEONE at Tesla reviews why cars were returned. But at the same time I wouldn't be surprised if they don't even record the reason for return."
"but this IS the case, unless you can prove it otherwise"
Mark Zuckenberk is a child rapist.
"If you know you can't or won't drive it for a while you just take off the plates, go to our equivalent of the DMV, hand them over and sign a paper. Then you call insurance and cancel it, they will electronically check that your vehicle currently isn't registered and approve it. It's very simple really.

If you want your plates back you simply go to the DMV, pay a small fee ($20-30 I think), put them on your car, call insurance and they get it insured in a matter of minutes."
"If he was talking to that employee pre-purchase, and assisted during the purchase, I don't think it's a stretch to say he ""sold"" him the car. No, he's not getting a commission, but it's close enough."
"When I buy a new car I have never dealt with the owner of the dealership other than maybe a handshake.  The sales associates and finance people are who I talk to who are employees just like the Tesla people.  So what's the difference other than they know the ""dealer"" and a different commission schedule?"
"Well seeing as I have already cancelled an order and I am looking at a m340, I don‚Äôt want a Tesla. I don‚Äôt want a car that will quickly become a nightmare to own just so I can have some cool gadgets. It‚Äôs not worth it for me. If I‚Äôm spending that kind of money, it shouldn‚Äôt be another headache in my life. They sell themselves for now, but once there is an alternative EV and people do more shopping before their purchase that will change."
"When was the last time you heard of Apple doing anything special or innovative? How many people are constantly complaining now that their products don't last more than 2-3 years due to bad proprietary choices and lack of modularity? Or in some cases even break under warranty multiple times and the only thing that saves them from leaving is the Apple store experience. With Covid 19 I'm seeing customers jump ship for good since they even get things fixed in store anymore (I do IT work and keep an eye on such things in the community). Here's someone I respect who buys a LOT of Apple product who I think summarizes the decline in quality quite while (since Jobs died): Rick Beato
https://youtu.be/MKJjLwMUPJI

They are just coasting on customer loyalty and their customer service department at this point. If one more thing breaks they are doomed. They are certainly not leading anything right now.

I love my wife's 2010 MacBook Air we got her and the 2010 iMac that still works from her dad but I don't plan to buy any new stuff from them. If you live in the Mac eco system I would suggest getting some 2014/2015 high end hardware and update the components (max RAM, SSD,netxm) and then just repair that as long as you can make it work."

He might stay motivated for reasons of global warming.
"If they wanted to make more money they would focus in selling there power trains to other manufacturers, which would be better for everyone."
"Let‚Äôs remember that they told him straight up they WOULD pay for the tow, they were just trying to determine which department was responsible for this. So yes it‚Äôs a communication issue and Tesla needs to work on that, no question. But it‚Äôs not like they were trying to stick him with the bill. OP just got impatient and spooked, which is somewhat understandable but they DID warn him it wouldn‚Äôt be covered unless it was a warranty claim."
"Not for an $1,100 tow. If you‚Äôre the roadside assistance rep that gets this call, and service is asking you to cover a tow for something that falls outside of the rules you‚Äôre paid to enforce, maybe you do it if it‚Äôs $50. But an $1,100 tow is wildly outside of any normal cost. It‚Äôs only like 180 miles, in rural Kansas where service is cheapest in the nation. The highest rate out there is typically $4/mi. That tow would have been a rip-off in the SF Bay Area. In Kansas, it‚Äôs straight up theft.

It makes sense that they were struggling to resolve this, because the service tech threw everyone under the bus by saying it‚Äôs a warranty claim."
"Based on what?!

I can give you the reasons I *believe* otherwise. 

1. His tweets do not seem calculated in any way; many of them have cost him personally, both in reputation and in actual money. At the very least, I conclude from that that he posts when and how he pleases, with no management team involved in writing his tweets. 
2. As for who he replies to, he seems to reply disproportionately often to a relatively small group of followers. That doesn't look like a team is scouring replies to bring the most deserving tweets to his attention, but more like he replies to the posts that catch his eye. 
3. I even think I remember him in an interview specifically disclaiming having anyone else involved in managing his Twitter feed. However, I can't find this quotation, if it indeed exists, so this is just a hazy memory of mine which may be mistaken. I don't claim it constitutes strong proof or that you should trust it, but it does factor in to my judgment.

But all that aside, I can't understand how you could reach the conclusion that unless someone proves that Musk doesn't have a team involved with his Twitter feed, it IS the case that he does. That's a lot of certainty to attach to an assumption with very little evidence behind it [that you've offered]."
"I get that, but what if your car is your only means of transportation and it's broken down? I dunno, maybe it's not as much of a hassle as I'm imagining. Are people from other countries able to drive into Norway without being insured? That is often a problem here in the states...lots of illegal immigrants are uninsured."
"I doubt his efforts were much more than administrative. It doesn't take much to sell someone on something they want. When I ask the Best Buy sales team to show me two colors of the new iPhone and then complete my purchase I don't necessarily say they sold me anything.

A local dealer is much more attached to the sale. First it's the dealer's bread and butter. No sale no money. Second it's sometimes the dealer's car or at least their responsibility. The actual sales person is also working on commission and is invested in the sale.

There are pros and cons to both models. The direct sales model is simple as there is no haggling or pressure to buy. The dealer model can provide better service if the dealer is working on getting the customer relationship."
"I'm sure if your car fell apart 100mi from the lot you could get some time with the owner if the dealership didn't do right by you.

Look Elon has his priorities and point of sale is at the bottom of the list. The model could work if they prioritized it."
"So I had an F30 340i prior to the Model 3P, and I can honestly say that I very much didn't like the BMW and I very much like the 3P.

The driving experience is much better with the Tesla. The ride is solid, feel is better, and you can just teleport around town in silence without drawing attention to yourself.

The F30 340i was a mistake of a car and it turned me away from the brand. If you go with the m340 I hope it's better than the previous generation, but from what I read the improvements were minor. The added limited slip will surely be fun to drift though. That's what I enjoyed the most about the 340i. It had a nice balance when the tail was out.

I recommend that you rethink the BMW purchase and give the 3P a chance. I can criticize the company, but I like the car more than anything else I've driven. Perhaps a good 911 would change my mind, but that's a car in a different league."
"‚ÄúWhen was the last time you heard Apple do anything innovative‚Äù

AirPods. Apple Watch. Ipad. None of these things have viable competitors. All are relatively new products that have come out since phones in general began to flatline in regards to innovation. (A phone can only do so many things, I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre expecting) 

All of these products work as well as they do because of the ecosystem, aka ‚Äúwalled garden‚Äù I‚Äôve heard people complaining about since 2007. The same reason people keep going with Apple products. The cohesion and reliability. Not the ‚ÄúApple store experience‚Äù and people aren‚Äôt leaving because ‚Äúcovid made it so they don‚Äôt do in store repairs anymore‚Äù no matter how much your anecdotal experience tells you so. 

On one hand you say you‚Äôre using a Mac from a decade ago, but you also say Apple products don‚Äôt last more than 2-3 years...

Sorry if I don‚Äôt take you seriously."
Lol yea no. People don‚Äôt just like Tesla because of the power train. And why would Tesla sell their power train with low margins if they could sell it as a car with high margin.
"> Let‚Äôs remember that they told him straight up they WOULD pay for the tow

Initially.  But then:

> My advisor then tells me I am responsible for the $1,100 tow truck bill. [...] They tell me I can contact Tesla corporate myself and plead my case, but not to expect much.

That's a major fuckup.  That's how you lose customers.  Did they eventually pay it?  Seems like it.  Should you *ever* make the customer do the legwork on a mistake you made?  Absolutely not.  The *bare minimum* you should do is contact the other department directly, with the customer present, and figure it out.  The fact that they *actually can't even do that* is just clown-shoes level stupid. 

I tell everyone that asks about my car that the vehicle is *amazing*.  Everything else about Tesla is like dealing with Comcast, except all the reps have amnesia and their phones only work 20% of the time."
"he can tweet what ever he wants, but it doesn't mean that there isn't a team checking his social media mentions and bring things to his attention when it warrants it. Take the pres. of USA, there is a team that manages his social media, but that doesn't stop him from shooting himself in the foot on a daily basis. So unless you can prove otherwise, what I say stands."
"If your car is broken down you can't really drive it anyways though, that's the same situation regardless of where on the planet you live. You usually don't take your plates off if it's fixed in like a week, would probably cost more to get the plates back than what you'd save on a week of insurance. If it's going to stay broken down for a month or more I'd take the plates off until it's fixed. Being without a working car is your problem though, unless you have a type of insurance that covers rental cars (in which case you don't want to cancel it because it's way cheaper than renting by yourself).

Regarding other countries driving into Norway I don't know for sure how that works, I assume they must be insured though and face the same consequences if they are caught and/or get into a crash. I don't think it's that relevant because I think all cars in the EU/EEC require insurance and most foreign cars in Norway are registered in those countries."
"It isn‚Äôt really about the car itself in terms of what it is designed to do, it‚Äôs about the cost, quality and ease of ownership for a luxury vehicle. There is no denying that the specs on the Tesla‚Äôs are nuts for the price, but the quality is also clearly lacking and the fact that it is a huge hassle to try to work with customer service a big turn off. I don‚Äôt want to deal with that. I currently drive a Lexus and on the rare occasion that things break they will literally come to my house the same day, pickup the car and drop off a loaner. Tesla won‚Äôt even fix your car, let alone help you get it to the shop. 

You get more than just a car when you shop a luxury brand and Tesla is failing in that regard. The best thing they have right now is a cool name in a trendy industry, but that isn‚Äôt enough to fool some potential customers."
"The iPad came out in 2010, Jobs died in 2011. I don't mind the walled garden all that much as the vertical integration is what allowed Apple to be better (end to end integration and quality) than PC or Linux based products. I had an iPhone up until 2015 and only gave it up b/c it was a company phone. Then I went to a Google phone because it was as close to that iPhone experience without being quite as expensive, but I missed the iPhone for sure. 

Disagree on the airpods. Not innovation in the level of iPod, iMac, iPhone or iPad. Sure it's been copied a bit but it's not altering an industry or creating a whole new ecosystem. It's altered one niche of products with an incremental change. I don't find it terribly ambitious and I think you're being pretty disingenuous if you're comparing it to those other four products. 

The iWatch might be comparable but I personally don't find it that inspiring and it's certainly not something I see a lot of people dying to have or showing off to other people like they did when they got a new iPod, iPad, iPhone or an iMac. It's more an accessory than a necessity. I don't think I'll ever get one cuz I just don't wear watches much mostly due the fact that it interferes with when I either drum, run or play tennis. Combine that with my ADHD and I'll most likely lose it and the $ in the process when I take it off.

I will look for some of the numerous other posts I've seen of people talking about the decline in quality of Apple hardware (mostly computers) since around 2013 or so where anything bought after that is noticeable worse in quality (I'm out and about right now on the mobile). I don't think it's so much that they decided to be worse in quality, as much as the decision making (internal connection choices, modularity or lack thereof, etc.) is worse and there isn't the same culture of using your own products (what we call on the industry ""eating your own dog food"") and Jobs demanding a certain level of quality before it can be shipped out the door. I'm no religious zealot of Jobs and I know there are just as many things he got wrong that he got right. The biggest thing he got wrong in my opinion was he didn't teach what he knew inherently to his team. He ruled more like a dictator than an empowering leader and as a result I think he left too big of a vacuum. Instead of leaving a legacy he left a black hole within his own company."
"Because they can't build cars that don't fall apart? It cost them a huge amount of of money, they can make enough volume, they have countless production issues etc it's a mess."
"Like I‚Äôve been saying up and down this thread, I agree this is bad communication on Tesla‚Äôs part. No question. But it‚Äôs pretty clear that OP‚Äôs situation was highly unusual in that it wasn‚Äôt technically warranty work, so they might need some time to resolve which department is responsible for the bill. OP was standing there asking them to resolve it on the spot so the driver would stop calling him. That complicates things even more. Yes, they should have been able to resolve this more efficiently. But returning a car because they took a day to resolve a thorny and very expensive billing issue? Sounds like OP overreacted a bit."
That's cool and what meets your needs is important. I don't regret my choice as I don't think a different car in this price segment would provide the joy of ownership that the 3P does. If you are seriously considering this price segment I would recommend the Tesla nevertheless.
"They‚Äôre barely profitable rn (getting better) by making their own cars, so just selling the powertrain would be stupid. 

Also, it‚Äôs questionable if other car manufacturers would buy it. Teslas are not just the best selling cars because of the powertrain. The regular updates and autopilot are huge selling points, the quality isn‚Äôt nearly as bad as you make it out to be, and the efficiency of the design allows for a range that other car manufacturers couldn‚Äôt even match if they had Tesla‚Äôs powertrain."
"He owned the car for less than a day and had to take two days off work, stay in a hotel, and have the fun experience of momentarily being stuck with an $1100 bill for something that was someone else's fault, only to then be left with a car that still would be hours from a service center if anything went wrong.  He was understandably concerned."
"Do you know anything about cars?

Selling the powertrain would reduce a huge amount of overhead and would eliminate the majority of there bottlenecks. Its the season Honda is in f1 as an engine supplier but not a full works team, its a hell of a lot cheaper.

You mean the auto pilot that won't actually be able to work properly for another 20 years at the very least? 

The quality is awful for a company that size, no other major manufacturer has that many quality control issues and as bad customer service. 

Are you actually serious? The design couldn't be matched by anyone else?

Adrian newey could design something on his drawing board in less than an hour that's more efficient."
"Concerned seems fair. Returning the car over it? Possibly justified, probably not. Either way, I feel like I‚Äôm right to point out in this thread that it wasn‚Äôt some massive failure on Tesla‚Äôs part. They were all trying to follow the rules."
"Okay lol, you know nothing about Tesla obviously. The cars are much more valuable than the powertrain alone. 

> You mean the auto pilot that won't actually be able to work properly for another 20 years at the very least?

Lol okay if you think so. Just got an update that enables me to drove 90% of my trips on autopilot.

> The quality is awful for a company that size, no other major manufacturer has that many quality control issues and as bad customer service.

It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs not awful enough to just call it quit, not nearly. Most customers are happy with their cars, our model 3 is great too.

> Are you actually serious? The design couldn't be matched by anyone else?

Effiecency-wise? No, at least not without Tesla as competition.

> Adrian newey could design something on his drawing board in less than an hour that's more efficient.

Drawing something is a lot easier than actually producing something. Teslas are still the most efficient cars on the road.

Remind me in a few years when Tesla produces a few million cars a year."
"Real auto pilot is nowhere near close, it's illegal.

Well that's just wrong. There's nothing special about the tesla outside of its powertrains efficiency wise. Its a simple clean low drag design but that's it, doesn't have active suspension, adjustable camber or toe to further reduce drag. 

Tesla doesn't have that advanced aero development technology, nothing compared to most big car manufacturers who are attached to racing teams. They can create a far more efficient and effective aero design. 

Hell porsche did it with the taycan, a low drag coefficient isn't the be end and end all for efficiency, channelling air to the break ducts reduce wear, increases regen and efficiency further. 

Anything Adrian newey can draw he can get made and it will be made a hell of a lot faster than anything tesla makes. The man has 10 constructors championship."
"> Real auto pilot is nowhere near close, it's illegal.

Level 4 and 5 autonomy is not illegal everywhere, and if it‚Äôs safer than a human driver, it won‚Äôt take long to be legal everywhere.

> Well that's just wrong. There's nothing special about the tesla outside of its powertrains efficiency wise.

Tesla doesn't have that advanced aero development technology, nothing compared to most big car manufacturers who are attached to racing teams.

So why didn‚Äôt they yet? Maybe because they want to get their design language in every car? 

> Hell porsche did it with the taycan, a low drag coefficient isn't the be end and end all for efficiency, channelling air to the break ducts reduce wear, increases regen and efficiency further.

Because the taycan is know for its efficiency... lol

> Anything Adrian newey can draw he can get made and it will be made a hell of a lot faster than anything tesla makes. The man has 10 constructors championship.

Then it‚Äôs game on... !remindme 24 months"
"Game on then, the Aston Martin valkyrie vs the roadster round the nurburgring. 

The guy has already designed 30+ racing cars that shit all over the roadster in every performance metric."
I wasn‚Äôt talking about the performance alone. It‚Äôs Tesla vs everybody else. A 3 Million Euro car that‚Äôs a little faster doesn‚Äôt win it for me. But we‚Äôll see in a few years...
"Tesla vs everyone else, we'll it's obvious tesla will loose. They have a small market share and can't scale up to meat demand."
Well as I said... it‚Äôs Game on.

I bought 2 shares at 220. I have a lot of feelings. Joy mostly.
"Bought some shares with fun money at $190 joking ‚Äúhey maybe this will pay for a tesla someday‚Äù. Now it‚Äôs just about there, crazy."
"Crossed the $1,000/share line a few minutes ago!"
A couple of Elon's tweets will fix that.
"Where are you getting Toyota's value from? Google tells me they're currently worth 23T YEN, or about $214b. TSLA is only $185b."
"You have to wonder what Q2 will look like, probably not great."
[deleted]
"It doesn't seem to make much sense, but it feels good."
"I sold my only share I received as a gift back last year at about 270.

I‚Äôll never make that mistake again lol"
"I had about 30 shares from the IPO around $17 each. Wish I kept those, but I mean who really could have known back then."
And to think I had a thousand shares at 31.32 ...
"They aren‚Äôt just an automaker. So there is market capital/demand being taken from other industries as well. Batteries, big rigs, solar...to name a few. 

Regardless, this is a notable achievement."
"Other than Ford, still the only American company that has NEVER gone bankrupt"
"And as a stock, it's extremely overvalued..."
Imagine if you bought some stock when it was in the $400s during March. Now it's over $1k and you would've doubled you're money in 3 months. Remember when Elon said TSLA price was over valued at $750. I should've YOLOd everything into TSLA/AAPL/AMZN during the massive dips in late March when everything was on lockdown
In since $29... Guess I'm rich now?
"My options I sold to mess around with shorter term things, aka gamble, would be worth around 2.4 mil today. Hard to live that one down."
"Talking about market cap is fun and all, but it‚Äôs a bit like saying ‚ÄúMy house is now the most valuable house on the street in terms of how much equity the owner has in the house!‚Äù. That‚Äôs not really saying much about whether you have the most valuable house on the street. You could have a fully paid off $200k house while your neighbor has 25% equity in their $400k house. If you want to talk about how much a company is actually worth for comparison purposes, you should be using [enterprise value](https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ek5a69/the_basic_principles_of_business_valuation_people/)."
Time for Tesla to raise some more cash through another stock offering.  They can only build more factories at the same time if they have enough cash.
I like Tesla but come on. It‚Äôs valued as a tech company not a car company. You really think Tesla is more valuable than Toyota?
Fuck yeah dude!
All credit to Elon‚Äôs vision and excecution.
"""But they're still a start-up and shouldn't be held to the same quality standards as other companies."""
Sold part of my position yesterday... hoping for a similar patter to last time it spiked.
"Some history on the other side:

[Short Interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/short-interest)"
Nio has a big enough market cap to make the top 25. You forgot Nio
The other automakers have more debt and significantly different capital structures. I would look at enterprise value for a more relevant comparison.
"Congratulations to all, including Elon."
"This is nuts, considering that Tesla's market share is around 1.3%. Go, Tesla, go! Go get 'em!!!!"
This time next year possibly double.
Can someone explain what this means?
And yet still has the worst customer service pre-post purchase...yay :/
"This is cool, but what does this really mean for the size of a company? it just means it's stock price is high right"
Buy puts
"Great, now can the QA and service quality surpass Toyota next?"
USA! USA! USA! üá∫üá∏ üòÅ
Is this accurate? Wasn't Toyota over $200B
"Tesla should do a capital raise, hostile takeover of Ford, take all their factories and shut them down :)"
 i wrote a covered call at 1000 ecpiring this friday.. Looks like i am parting way with my 100 sharea.. Thx elon you glorious bastard
The somewhat crazy share price gives tesla nearly endless capital to make beautiful cars and really push the rest of the car industry to join in. Eventually tesla will be able to produce that true model t of evs.

"I remember the time two years ago when ppl kept telling me how Tesla would die in a few years. 

I love laughing in their faces now."
Lmfao
Wow!
"I see a lot of people talking about when they bought for $200. I'm here and I just bought one share at $990 today lol

I really do believe electric is the future. Think about where Tesla will be in 5 years?"
I wish I‚Äôd invested more when it was still in the 200 range but darn how life turns out. At least I made something from having 1 stock.
"Looks better than stocks before the dot com bust but still, like the prospectus says, past performance is no indication of future performance."
"Look Buddy, fuck you. FUCK YOU! LANCIA IS MAKING TOP NOTCH QUALITY CARS NOW. WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WANTS AN UGLY HIDEOUS DELTA FROM THE 80S THAT LOOKS LIKE A BRICK LET ALONE A DIRTY RALLY CAR. THE NEW YPSILON IS UNDENIABLY THE GREATEST CAR TO COME OUT OF ITALY IN RECENT YEARS WITH STAGGERING 94 HORSEPOWER SUPPLIED BY A SUPPLE 1.3 CYL MULTIJET INLINE4, 6 SPEED MANUAL AND 2 STARS ON THE EURONCAP. SO WHAT IF ITS SLOW, SO WHAT IF ITS UNSAFE???? THE TRUE ENTHUSIAST BRAND HAS NEVER BEEN THIS GOOD."
I was going to buy 5 shares when it was in the 300/400s a few months back but didn‚Äôt. I took an L
"And I don't see much teslas cruising around,  only toyotas and volkswagens. so seems like a pump to me, without real objective evaluation."
So Elon will take Tesla private at $42069?
Tesla is not just an automaker.  They are also an energy solution and software developer for self driving.
I kick myself everyday for not buying more shares.
No pollution stonks time
Wonder if they have any plans to split stock.
average buy around 200. Quite awesome return still not my best though. ;)
"A company that has never posted an annual profit (not even on an operating basis) is now the most valuable automaker in the world.

A lesson in never underestimating the power of a company that has people religiously devoted to it (is c-u-l-t actually a banned word here?).  Dotcom 2.0, here we go!"
Not if bear gang has anything to say about it
I'm reading this while my powers out in Ontario Canada. Lol
Tesla is not an automaker.
when does he get arrested?
It's not though is it. It's a rich mans car. Not a car anyone can own. Its way over valued. He even said it himself. It will come crashing down. They are saddled with debt and barely sell any cars.
Elon musk makes his factory workers expose themselves to a pandemic. Fuck these cars.
"Would love to see a few more columns added. Revenue, EPS, etc. I have a Model 3 that I love, but something about this still seems speculative and fishy."
Where is NKLA in the list?
I'm surprised at how high ferrari is on this list but they probably have some other product that I'm not aware of aside from their super luxury sports cars
"This isn‚Äôt true, Toyota is still #1 by market cap at 215ish Billion as Tesla is only 185Billion. But still amazing it‚Äôs over 1k per share!"
"I bought almost 200 in the 400s a couple months ago.

Beyond my expectations..."
"I bought 100 shares at $28. Never take profits, keep letting it ride!!"
"I didn't have enough money to buy a Model S 85 in early 2013, so I took the plunge and bought 2000 TSLA @ 36.25 instead."
I have 14 shares at $370. Wishin‚Äô I bought more. Not sure it‚Äôs gonna drop for a while now.
"I had 8 shares averaging a price per share of about $300, and sold 3 of them at about $450. I only did so thinking it would drop a bit and I coul add another share or two for free. Then it just kept climbing."
"I bought at 220 as well. 4 shares. I sold them at the previous peak early this year, getting $945 each. I am pleasantly surprised to see the stock has rebounded so strongly as to have passed its previous peak. :)"
"Lol.. i bought some at 40$ in 2014 and almist forgot about them... then it rose to like 400 and i was joying..

Then it fell to like 2xx last year and i was fedup... then it rose to 320 in december and i sold them all with a grin on my face... like a couple weeks after they were 800$ 

I eat my soup with lots of salt now even though i shouldnt"
"I'm with you. A few years ago I wanted to start investing and opened a Roth Ira account, put 1000 in it. When covid started I saw my 401k drop and while tinkering around with the fidelity app I realized I could allocate the funds of my Roth Ira account. I put that 1k towards 2 tesla stocks at 434 each.

Today my biggest regrets are that I didn't do it sooner (opened the ira account around 2016 because I wanted to invest) and that I didn't buy some with actual cash (now I see gains but can't touch them until I retire). I expected it to go up a bit but this is insane."
"Got one at 540, just for fun. I'm impressed with the gains, but consider it luck."
"I bought 1 at 240.

had a hunch to buy more, but, divorce......"
I bought 160 shares at $220-240 range. I also have Joy
I bought 24 last year at 182$....then sold a few months later for massive profits...or I least I though that was massive profits - turns out it was just alright.
I got 4 shares at $120 for my 17th birthday. I too have some feelings.
Haha thats awesome to hear
"I got a few shares around 200 when talk started of FSD price increasing. I wanted a Model Y which wasn‚Äôt out, wasn‚Äôt ready to commit to Model 3 yet. Figured if it‚Äôs all as valuable as they say, I‚Äôm better off just buying the stock. Still don‚Äôt have my Model Y but the FSD is paid for lol. Although I‚Äôm holding the stock longer regardless."
"Happened to me just now,  but bought the Tesla before the moonshot.  Couldn‚Äôt wait.  Now I don‚Äôt wanna sell lol."
"Holt shit it actually happened. Fueled by the cokeheads at the FED running the money printer, but still"
"*Tesla becomes the most valuable automaker*

Elon: My time has come"
"Really wondering what happened to all the people on twitter complaining about that one day dip, which looks hardly even noticeable at this point. ""I lost $10k today!"" I guess unless you sold during that you're probably up $20k at this point."
Haha! Hahahaha! Haaaa! üò∞üòìüò•
"Fingers crossed, I want to buy more."
"""I will sell all my worldly possessions, including my Tesla Shares"""
Only took a week to recover from Elon‚Äôs tweet last time though
"‚ÄúTesla overvalued imo‚Äù was at $750 a month ago, now were over $1k..."
Google Finance is notoriously inaccurate for market cap. Yahoo Finance is better.
"Toyota is $168b intraday, 11AM ET, June 10, 2020, according to Yahoo Finance"
"Doubt it matters to investors. They already know the factory was shut down for much of Q2. Everyone is expecting low delivery numbers and a big loss.

Their Q3 guidance will likely matter much more."
I think the stock will rally on a bad Q2.
This stocks doesnt care about any numbers. They use any excuse to go higher.
"If numbers are good, go long. If number are bad, go long. Fundamentals no longer matters in current market environment."
"Hopefully it drops to 300 so I can load up on cheap shares and watch it shoot to 2000. Now that it is proven the stock can reach 1000, it would be unreasonable to expect it to stay below that for long, as long as the core idea of Tesla stays the same."
It‚Äôs looking decent. Probably around 80k cars delivered.
Wow. $400k profit in 4 years is insane.
"Goddamn that‚Äôs amazing, I only have 4 shares at $280 avg. Bought my first in October of 2016, but being fresh out of college I didn‚Äôt have as much to put in haha I‚Äôm still very happy with the return though!"
r/HypeMan himself is a [naysayer of the stock price](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239815256797184?s=20)
Do you have your main portfolio on an index fund?
That's $543000. I'd pull out. That's a lot of money.
"To be fair, it makes more and more sense the less you think about it."
r/suddenlygay
"I came here to say just this.  Love Tesla, and my car, but how can they be #1 when there are people who still think my model 3 costs 100k."
No one became poor taking a profit.
"When did you sell? Presumably you still made a bundle at least, though not the $1mm you could have had today...."
Only American AUTO company
"Ford only avoided bankruptcy by selling off all of its component brands though (JLR, Aston Martin, etc)"
"And by doing that, Ford collectively fucked itself for the oncoming changes to Automotive consumerism, things like EVs, Self-Drive, etc.  They do not have a great amount of cash flow to overcome it.  

Besides, we have a president who has a shitload of bankruptcies under shell companies bearing his name.  I thought you'd take more pride in bankruptcy being part of The Art of the Deal^^TM"
Lmfao this is the stupidest comment on this thread
"I passed over buying Amazon when it was at 80 for that reason.  I can still hear the cries of the internet from those days:

‚ÄúA company that doesn‚Äôt consistently make money has a $30B market cap... the market is in a bubble!‚Äú"
I'm hyper bull on Tesla. I think they'll eat everyone else. But 1k *today* makes no sense. Specially with what seems to be a *deep* recession incoming. I think a global crash is coming and I think TSLA can crash to something like 400 or something stupid like that.
Why would you say that? The company only lost almost a billion dollars last year and has .5% of the global market share!
Elon indirectly announced the million mile battery last night. He has confirmed that this is true.  https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/h07h3l/elons_email_today_this_means_only_one_thing/
"Perhaps.  Or its just a head of itself.

Tesla is so much more than a car maker. Besides the fact no one is any where close to the car they have, the world wide super charing network and line up, of EVs-- their autopilot is years ahead and will be the first when self driving is legal.  

They're a tech company that will buy other companies like Amazon did-- people thought they were just a book seller..."
"Holding what i have but not buying more right now. But I do think it could blow past $1200 in this insane market, just because you know things don't have to make sense."
"As of today, TSLA is still the most undervalued stock I can find in the stock market. So it's still my largest stock holding. I research a lot of companies."
"I think it's probably pretty accurate.

Stock reflects the combined estimations of future performance of a company, not its present.

Tesla is the leader in self-driving car technology and battery technology.  They make striking luxury cars and a relatively insane price.  They have 0 traditional media advertising budget but thanks to the reputation  of the cars and their egomaniac CEO's twitter account keeping them in the news, Model 3 cars are the most sold cars in some countries on month by month basis.

I cannot imagine a future in which Tesla is not viewed as a truly dominant force in the auto industry."
No it's really not.
">overvalued

undervalued\* anything below $10k is a bargain."
TSLA is still one of the most undervalued and the most misunderstood company in the world.
Buy the dip.  Stonks go up.
"I fortunately did that (minus amazon) but by no means was it or could it ever be planned or foreseen by me or any individual. It was ‚Äúfun money‚Äù being actually gambled. Remember hindsight is 20/20 and ‚Äúbeating the market‚Äù is, for most investors, barely any different than gambling. I eventually sold everything once I had about 120% return on the original ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù(I prefer to call it gambling) before I decided it was enough and it was better to play safe. It could have gone either way and no matter what anyone says there‚Äôs no surefire way to ‚Äúbeat the market‚Äù. Remember Columbus‚Äô Egg in that once an answer is established it seems obvious ‚Äúoh well of course amazon would do well, oh of course Tesla would do well‚Äù. Don‚Äôt forget the tens if not hundreds of similar companies that could‚Äôve been just as promising back in the day and simply went bust. It‚Äôs stock survivorship bias. If you want to survive in the long run, diversify your portfolio, be happy with your average market gains.
You could make the point that the global pandemic was an atypical occurrence and, because of it, an atypical opportunity. That wouldn‚Äôt be investing, though. This kind of completely unforeseen situation happens every so often and it could have ended up either way, and even if you could predict these occurrences you‚Äôd still wouldn‚Äôt be able to precisely predict the behavior of millions of investors."
Depends on how many shares you have.
Do you know that when people celebrate New Years Eve that they're actual celebrating an arbitrary point in space where the Earth is in relation to the sun?
"So Ford has a higher enterprise value than Tesla because Ford has a lot of debt compared to Tesla (or less cash), do I understand this right?

And why not consider annual revenue instead of enterprise value when comparing different companies?"
"Wow, I came here to say exactly this and you remembered my post!! I literally jumped out of my seat when I saw this, thank you!"
"It is so difficult to value their intellectual property, patents and head start on competitors."
"That's a terrible analogy. The correct analogy is you and your neighbor each invested $100 into your houses and now third party buyers are willing to pay $1,000 for yours and $50 for your neighbor's. It doesn't matter how or why they value your house at $1,000. It just matters that you have created $900 of wealth for yourself, which you can tap into in a variety of ways."
"Right but in your analogy I think market cap actually makes more sense? In this case the person with the $200k house is richer than the one with 25% equity in $400k. Similarly the fact that Ford would have some much debt that it pushes down the market cap below Tesla would indicate they are indeed worth less.

When you take debt you get an equal amount of cash (minus interests) so the market cap barely changes. You then use the cash to invest which drives the cash down but it is supposed to make your business more valuable (new technology, etc) hopefully resulting in a net gain, but it‚Äôs also possible that the cash is spent poorly and it didn‚Äôt raise your company‚Äôs value, driving market cap down. So I think market cap ultimately does what it is supposed to do by telling which company is current the most valuable including capital management which is important.

There are obviously different ways to measure value but i think market cap is probably fine. But then this whole ‚Äúwho‚Äôs first‚Äù is also not terribly interesting compared to looking at order of magnitude differences (company A is 10x compared to B)."
"> you should be using enterprise value.

great, set up a spreadsheet like https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HflVng6sYIb6Gs4pOKiDGtqU5YJ2-hgdM4pRNaT62gs (copy that one if you like) and fix the formulas to show enterprise value. We'll be glad to upvote you for the work.

Please note that spreadsheet auto updates so you'll need source data that is always available."
"No flipping way!! That said, when the hell are Detroit and the Germans going to male a good BEV??? Model S came out in 2011."
What about the engineers who actually designed and built the products?
This hasn‚Äôt been a spike so much as a graduated increase over weeks.
Less. 0.5%
SA! SA! SA!

Could you give me some tips? :-)
Shh don‚Äôt tell him about NKLA
"Neither is Toyota.  They make robots.  Nor Honda, they make all sorts of generators, lawnmowers, and other power equipment.  Hyundai makes cargo vessels and naval ships.  BMW even makes motorcycles.  Come to think of it, is anyone an automaker?  They all seem to have various other products besides passenger cars.

If only there was some term to describe companies that receive the majority of their revenue from selling cars...."
They literally make automobiles
"> barely sell any cars


Lol"
"> ‚Äúthey are saddled with debt and barely sell any cars.‚Äù

Not defending the share price, but this is typical of a growth stock is it not?

Tesla‚Äôs value in my eyes is in their autonomous driving tech. Their autonomous driving tech teaches itself with all the Tesla‚Äôs on the road. Think about the lead they have, and how they‚Äôre managing to do it better than all the big auto manufacturers with such a small marketshare. 

Even a pessimistic view might lead to a future where Tesla doesn‚Äôt even make cars, and where a Chevy or Ford is driven by Tesla autopilot."
He literally said anyone who wants to stay home can. That isn‚Äôt forcing people. I frankly do not trust your reading comprehension skills of the news.
Enjoy the down votes...
"It's definitely forward-looking. Legacy auto does not have a solid roadmap for growth. They appear to only aspire to tread water in market share, and they don't have ventures outside of the automotive space capable of generating multi-billion dollar revenue streams. Tesla does, and while it remains speculative, it's worth vastly more than no plan at all."
I will add them soon (I made the spreadsheet).
"Above Ford, apparently..."

"Nice


I‚Äôm with 44 at $300 average. Only wish I could go back in time and put some money on the Cubbies."
This is what I did in my paper account in reality I have 9 shares at 600
"I only had $5,000 at the time and decided to roll the dice. wish i had had more to risk now!"
I dumped all mine when Elon was seemingly having a meltdown on Twitter. Looked at the price today and am really regretting it. Damnit.
"Nice. I was in at 80, 120 and 220.

At 120 I leveraged the shit out of it and got stopped out by a dollar. I would now be retired if I hadn't been so rigid with my stop loss. Such a dick."
[deleted]
"Yup. 150 shares @$36. Bought and sold a couple times, but mostly just left it alone. Now Tesla dominates my portfolio."
"I told myself I‚Äôll only sell some of they split.  I‚Äôll take out my initial investment, but fuck, tempting!"
Smart early move. But why didn‚Äôt you buy more over time? You had about 8 years seeing your initial bet on Elon was right. Just wonder what kept you from adding more.
Geezus you've got the hardest diamond hands I've ever heard of
"I get it, but what's the point if you never sell? You have to take profit to enjoy them."
Congrats. I got in at $34 and have been holding steadily (though I sold some off a few years ago).
"Bought 4 shares at $25, God, I wish I would have bought more."
Am I on /r/wallstreetbets ?
That's when I first bought too. Unfortunately I didn't but again for a while. Never sold though. Have 43 so far.
In 2013 I could barely make rent! That's awesome dude!!
You still have those shares?
Wow. Well done. They should double again dude.
I was in at $13. Wishing I bought more
"$43 here :) Not selling, no way no how."
Not going to go broke with over 2x your money! Look at the positives!  (however i massively have this same regret)
"I have a sell order in at $1,200 to recoup my entire initial investment, but I can't think of anywhere I'd rather have my money than Tesla, so I'm thinking I might cancel it. If it hits that today while I'm offline I'll try to rebuy on a dip, should there be one, but we'll see."
"Haha, that really was the worst time to sell; did the same. But didn‚Äôt have the luck to get them as cheap as you did!"
"‚ÄúI really shouldn‚Äôt be saying this, but...‚Äù"
If you sold during that...I don‚Äôt even know why bother investing...
Is Bloomberg accurate? Says $213 B
"Who to trust though? Google, Bloomberg, and MSN all say about $214b. Yahoo and Robbinhood say about $180b."
"Pretty sure the market is rife with knee-jerk reactionaries. I'd guess at least a 10% drop on completely expected ""the 'rona got us"" numbers."
"Anything is possible right now. Robinhood traders caused Hertz to rally after it literally declared bankruptcy so things don't necessarily have to make any sense.

But if you've been in on TSLA since when it was in the low hundreds I'd probably take a good amount of profit off the table at $1000 before Q2 gets announced, there's no damned way it's not going to be ugly. The only car that would have really prevented a sales decline was the Y but if they're having production issues it's unlikely that it's going to salvage total sales.

The fact that they're not cell limited for the Semi might just reflect lower projections for how many 2170 cells are needed for 3 and Y for the rest of the year."
"May never drop below 800, who knows."
"Everyone keep saying this but when it does drop to 300, you think it'll drop down to 200 and miss out. Happens to every investor since the begining of time."
Homer Simpson: now *that's* what I like to hear!
At like 120ish to purchase my first house
doesn't change the point at all though...
"Yes, great investors look 10 years out. Tesla's next 10 years will blow people's mind."
"For every amazon there were 10 Nortels. 

You are basically playing the lottery with tech stocks in their infancy.

I would say in Teslas case buying last year was a smart call, still somewhat low but you know they are going to be a leader on electric cars and FSD. At this point they are overvalued."
"Good that there are doubters otherwise we wouldn't have time to load up and get rich haha, we'll sell our shares to the doubters for $900 after a split and they'll think it's a bargain, just like Apple probably was passed by many and they bought it anyway after it multiplies on price all of sudden it was a great investment."
Classic internet
"Amazon has posted consistent operating profits for the last 15 years.  Growth has been funded from revenue and leverage, not outside capital.

Tesla has posted consistent operating losses since day 1.  Growth has been funded largely from outside capital.  Completely different scenarios."
"Big difference. Much more upside or room for growth in ""the internet"" than there is in automobiles.

I believe in Tesla to be a successful automaker. I do not necessarily believe they will be earning as much as people think."
"The market is in a bubble rn, though. Literally only bad news and everything rallied"
"On the other hand, the majority of car owners in the US do not own a garage or park on the street. 

Tesla has a major street parking problem if they ever intend to cross below $30k cars in mass production. It‚Äôs been easy for them so far because the vast majority of people buying $50k+ cars also have a garage."
"I think the recession will wipe out a lot of demand, but I am optimistic because I think the EU incentives that have been announced by various countries will be enough to sell out surplus demand for Teslas for the foreseeable future."
What makes you sense a deep recession? I‚Äôm a noob
Expectations of future value are always priced into the stock market. If someone thought TSLA was worth $2000 in the long run then $1000 is a steal and they should buy. Attempting to predict how the market will behave is gambling.
The FED is buying everything.
What makes you think a recession is coming? The feds are pretty much stating they will give indefinite stimulus
">  I think TSLA can crash to something like 400 or something stupid like that.

It did back in March!"
Whats their market share of EV's?
[deleted]
"Amazon has had a lion's share of the market with AWS since the mid-2000s.  They've posted consistent operating profits for the last 15 years. Growth has been funded from revenue and leverage, not outside capital.

Tesla has posted consistent operating losses for the last 10 years. Growth has been funded largely from outside capital. Completely different scenarios."
"They are diverse but dont have much production in any of them. It's all about potential. It's all about finding justification out of anything.        
Tesla can literally shit bricks and sell it in boxes and people will buy more stocks because apparently Tesla found a way to make zero emission footprint bricks."
"How are they a tech company though? They make cars that are advanced, but I don't see the scalability of a tech company in their business model. They make cars, batteries, and solar panels, all of which scale slowly relative to a tech company that can instantly sell software to anyone over the internet. Even selling AP software would probably take a lot of modifications for it to work for another company.

That's where tech companies earn their large earnings multiples, the potential for fast scalability, and I just don't see that with Tesla. They could exponentially increase sales early on because they started from so few, but it gets harder and more expensive to scale at the same rate whereas a tech company sees a much smaller difficulty in continuing to scale up. I don't doubt they'll keep dominating the EV space, I just don't really know where they go from there."
It might even break 1200$ this week :O
They have 0 advertising budget. Their marketing budget is quite large. Free roadsters and Model Ys aren‚Äôt cheap. The referral program is marketing.
"Obviously, stocks are forward looking but at some level, the price gets to a point where EVERYTHING will have to go perfectly over a period of time for a company to grow into the share price. Tesla is approaching levels where everything will have to workout perfectly over the next 5 or 10 years to justify the value. Over a long enough period of time, the chances of everything going perfectly get's infinitesimally small."
"Just remember, this guy has a history here of being banned for trolling."
"Don't you have 1,000 shares"
This describes any anniversary.
Revenue *is* often used to compare different companies. The proper metric to use for comparison depends on what you're trying to get out of it
"Correct. Debt is included because it can be used to finance the acquisition of productive assets. Cash is deducted because it can be used by the buyer of the company to instantly pay down debt. 

Comparing revenue metrics is another good comparison, but every metric has its flaws. Just as enterprise value can tend to overestimate the value of debt-heavy firms that aren‚Äôt effectively utilizing that debt for growth (an argument that can be made for several large automakers), revenue comparisons do not give any credit to growth projections or margins. A good analysis will typically involve a comparison of several metrics."
"No, Ford has $115 billion in long term debt. That does not make for a good enterprise value‚Äî whoever we‚Äôre to buy ford would assume that debt.

I think Tesla has something closer to $12B in debt. So a lot, unless of you are counting on 50% growth year over year, then that debt becomes a small fraction of revenue."
"Value is subjective, and what the market determines as value isn‚Äôt always right. That‚Äôs why I own shares of Tesla, because I think it‚Äôs value is higher than what the market values it at today due to the things you mentioned."
"enterprise value compares asset value

market cap compares equity value

In the example you give, the value of the house as an asset changes (enterprise value) and that in turn causes the equity value to be higher (the amount your investment in the house is worth)"
"You‚Äôre conflating the value of a company with the value of the equity in that company. 

If you buy a model 3 for cash and I finance it with 50% down, are our model 3s worth a different amount? Your *ownership* is more valuable, but the assets are identical. You can‚Äôt ignore debt financing."
It‚Äôs in the spreadsheet 110110 posted. Scroll right.
I dunno to be honest I thought they‚Äôd have one by now. I‚Äôve always said Toyota/Subaru should do an EV WRX. But I‚Äôm not in charge.
Execution requires teamwork.
"""Over the course of 2019, Tesla‚Äôs share of the U.S. automotive market gradually rose to roughly 1.3 percent."" - Statista"
A! A! A!
"Invest based off things near you. Products you know and love. If you use something at your work that is working, others will use it too. If you couldn‚Äôt live without your Netflix buy Netflix. And don‚Äôt be hesitant to sell if your loss becomes too great for your nerves. Real money is all that really counts."
"People that pump TSLA and shit on NKLA as vaporware are my favorite people to follow.

NKLA is example number two though."
Nikola? Haha
VW is actually just a sausage company.
You can find a clue from their mission statement.
Did I stutter ? Vs other car makers it's a blip. It's an oversold tech stock. It'll get taken down a peg or two. It's a luxury car and always will be until it can sell for half of it's cheapest. Once those that can buy have. It's market is gone. It's the apple of cars except apple sells a lot more than Tesla ever can.
Oh i own stock. I think it'll be higher than 1k. Just not a jump from 500 to 1000 in a matter of months. Pure speculation and all the while big musk was risk loves to get cars built that he wouldn't be able to sell.
"Oh no not my precious internet points. Shit is such a joke, people can't get elons dick out of their mouths long enough to see what a piece of shit he is."
"Not really, they are calling Market Cap by different definitions, Yahoo Finance is just using **Share Price x Shares Outstanding** as Market Cap, however for Google(Also Bloomberg) is taking in to account their debt and cash reserves, with Share Price x Shares Outstanding which is a much much better way to understand a company‚Äôs Market Cap and any strengths or weaknesses, this can also be called Enterprise Value. Most ‚Äòreal‚Äô investors care more about EV value then the standard SP x SO, because takes into account debt and reverses.

**So that‚Äôs why the news hasn‚Äôt reported on this because TSLA ‚Äòhasn‚Äôt actually‚Äô beat Toyota in Market Cap yet**

For example one main reason why TSLA isn‚Äôt #1, is because of their debt currently around 13B (Feb 2020)

So for example this 13B would be subtracted from SO x SP."
Hey kid. Thumb a hundred bucks will ya. Help save the clock tower.
Investing is all about managing your regrets
Wait... what did you say!???

"The kind of volume seen by TSLA is \*way\* beyond Robinhood.

There's major hedge funds, pension funds, etc buying."
"TSLA is going above $10,000 a share within 10 years. I started buying below $30, kept adding because TSLAQ gave me so many great entry points that I couldn't resist. They literally don't have a clue about this company. As for Q2, I agree it could be weak, but the stock might rally big time."

"They suffer the financial issue and seems no better. They even have to delay their EV F150 in 2022 and cancel the deal with Rivian to built their EV Lincoln, not good."
"I know it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that they didn‚Äôt declare bankruptcy. I specifically said they avoided it. My point is that saying ‚ÄúFord didn‚Äôt declare bankruptcy‚Äù without context makes it seem like they somehow managed things way better than the others, when in fact they had to sell off significant assets to make that happen, whereas the others didn‚Äôt."
What Tesla is doing now seemed crazy 10 years ago. What Tesla will do in next 10 years seems crazy now. Inertia.
"I totally agree. Tesla had a massive headstart in the EV space by being 100% dedicated to it, and most companies are now even more delayed with coming out with a competing car due to the coronavirus. At the very least, many are being more cautious about spend on research since sales are way down. 

After shopping around for a new car and deciding on the Model 3 in 2018, I was convinced that no other company would have anything like it for a while. I used to be worried that someone else would use their decades of experience making cars to catch up and beat Tesla, but I believe Tesla has moved far past that point now."
"People have been calling tesla overvalued even since they were $100 a pop..

I bought early at 40$ back then because i believed in their vision.. didnt even care for profits..
Sold all at 320 in december just before they exploded to 800...

But yea i totally agree that stock market is simply legal gambling"
And what did amazon do in their first decade?
"> operating losses since day 1. 

This is false. The last few quarters have shown profits."
"Yup Amazon and Tesla are slightly different business models.  Tesla is a bit more capital intensive because of the investment required to build new factories, so they go to the capital markets to raise money.  But, this is not a weakness, this is a strength.  GM, Ford, Toyota, VW cannot do this.  They cannot raise money to build new EV factories because of their piss-poor value harvesting capital structure and inflexible pension and labor cost structure.

As an ‚Äúasset lite‚Äù tech company Amazon would have been much easier to crush than Tesla will be once it gets its factories online.  That‚Äôs what makes it a once in a generation type investment.  They might go bust, sure but If not there‚Äôs a very real chance for a 5 or 10x from these prices.  That‚Äôs why you buy TSLA at a premium today."
I am no accountant. How can I find out if a company is making operational profits?
I remember you. From the old days. Thanks for keeping this sub straight. Lot of crazy people here now.
"Idk, there is a lot of money in cars and an increasing pressure to get away from fossil fuels."
"There will be a lot more competition going forward though.  
They have been allowed to dominate the EV part of the market for a long time, but other manufacturers are starting to catch up."
"I'm not expert so take it with a grain of salt, but I've been following markets for years. I see loads of debt, political instability and 2nd wave of coronavirus. Everybody is acting like it was a minor scare. Now we have even more zombie companies and liquidity does not mean solvency. Bankruptcies and layoffs are on the way. Heck even the first corona wave hasn't ended. AZ for example is about to call for emergency measures *again*."
"Up to a point. You don't price in decades of potential. It's too unpredictable. It's why Apple wasn't worth 1.5T in 2007. It's too hard to predict.

Right now Tesla is pricing in probably at least 5-10 years of earnings growth. It's worth $186B. In what year will their earnings be $18B?"
"Always priced in lol, so you are saying in march it was priced in when it was $350? What changed over that 2 months exactly?"
It is not. And while i agree is really really distorting markets. The FED cannot fix solvency unless they really warp their mandate. They could but i really doubt they'll intervene much more than what they already did. If they do in fact intervene it'll be be after another scare like March
"They're buying corporate bonds. AFAIK, Tesla is not currently issuing corporate bonds."

"Except when people misunderstood Amazon and what it was becoming.  Look, bottom line here is what is Tesla, and where is it going?  The past is the past-- so they ""burned"" through billions (although I call it investing in themselves.)  The fact is, they are selling Model 3s and Ys and are destroying their ICE competition.  The $40-$60k car market is being very quickly gobbled up by Tesla.  Its only a matter of time before they can then drop something in the Honda Civic price rage and then its game over for ICE-- not only because of Tesla because other EV makers will finally realize there is a significant market share.

Tesla went from making 900 cars a week in 2017 to now making 10,000+ a month only 3 years later.  Thats 10x growth. Its not nothing.  And we don't even know the Y numbers, it could be closer to 15,000 a month now."

"This doesn‚Äôt make sense.  Firstly, cash is included and deducted from equity value to get to enterprise value (ie, net debt is added to equity value to get to ev).  Secondly, I don‚Äôt really understand your comment on debt - debt is simply a form of capital, and a company will have some amount of debt as part of their ‚Äòoptimal‚Äô capital structure.  Debt amplifies equity returns when at this optimal level, and does not need to be used in some certain way to be deemed effective."
"I am right there with you. Thier battery, autopilot and electric motor tech are so far ahead of their competition."
"In your case, since I buy the Model 3 for cash I own it outright and I will be richer than you who only owns half the car. I think we both understand the difference in the two way of measuring worth here. You want to say we are measuring the car not the person‚Äôs net worth but that‚Äôs just another metric to measure since most care more the ‚Äúwho‚Äôs richer‚Äù part. I mean, you can also look at profits, revenue, cash holdings, etc.

Market cap is just a useful tool to see how much the company *itself* is worth. For example, Apple is sitting on a giant pile of cash. Do you not count them (if you just count the equity you don‚Äôt count cash and debt)? But the cash is a big portion of Apple‚Äôs strength in that they can use it to invest that other companies can‚Äôt. And also if Apple uses the cash to buy something of value, it won‚Äôt change the market cap, but would change the enterprise value which seems weird to me since the value of a company shouldn‚Äôt jump up and down like that.

Anyway, there is no right or wrong. You just different metrics to measure different things."

"Yep, I gambled a lot of money on a V-Shaped recovery.   ""Let's pretend I lose 15% will that change my quality of life for the worse?  No.   Let's say it increases by 100% would that change my quality of life? Yes.""   It's the same reason people buy lottery tickets.   $5 doesn't really bring much happiness.  $5 million would bring a lot of happiness.

I ended up chickening out and only putting in a small amount into leveraged ETFs after taking some early wins. But that was also a quality of life choice.  The stress was too much and with the way the world is, it wasn't worth the anxiety after all.  In retrospect I ""should"" have held my guns and been house shopping right now, but I know I made the right decision for my sanity at the time.

Now everything is set to auto-sell if things start going the other direction.   With a well programmed exit plan and sufficient volume in trading you can always get out.   So no reason to sell now when it might keep going up.

I don't usually decide to sell stocks, I just decide to enable an exit plan open trade trigger."

So, why *not* believe in more than $7k/share? :)"
"> When do you take money out of a great investment? 

In stages typically.

I'm pretty quick to take out my initial investment once it goes beyond double. It significantly reduces the risk in a worst case scenario."
"I was just discussing this very question with my 15 year old tonight. My answer was that you don‚Äôt sell until you have something better to do with the money. I have a long history of buying great stocks and making shitty sells. Bot $10k of TSLA calls at $30 in 2008, exercised and sold 1,700 shares at $170 a few months later. I thought I was a hero at the time. Now I only have 200 shares, and the stock hit $1000 today. Oh well. Never sell until you have something better to do with the money."
"So true, if people want to look at the massive picture....Tesla isn't even a good investment when you could have bought x stock instead, and sold for quicker, bigger gains.

So the odds of anyone doing the perfect trade is astronomically low. 

Tldr: totally agree"
I like this answer. I have no idea when to sell. I got lucky with timing the market and having extra cash at the right time. Maybe selling when I can buy a Tesla from the stock. I‚Äôm very patient and I believe I will have more opportunities to sell or buy any stock. That‚Äôs not really working because I‚Äôm not selling and it makes me nervous to keep buying. And now the stocks are going down today.

"With a price that low, he may be an original Roadster owners. Tesla gave them an option to buy up to 500 shares just before the IPO. The president of my owners club did that, getting in at $11. I'm pretty sure he still owners most, if not all, of those shares.

Where do you live that other kinds of gambling aren't legal?
"Took the largest share of the market with AWS, grew into a multibillion dollar company by doing so, and again, used little outside capital to do so, and started posting consistent operating profits near the end of that decade.

Tesla has been around since 2003.  A decade was 2013.  We're coming up on two decades now.  If you want an Amazon reference, at 17 years in, they did $48 billion in revenue with a $643 million dollar profit on the year."
"On an annual basis, Tesla hasn't posted an operating profit.  Generally just scattered quarters where they load up ZEV credits."
"Yeah, but let's be fair and accept that they don't profit on anything the manufacture or any service they sell. They are literally just selling regulatory credits which is just some imaginary thing governments created out of thin air."
High capex tends to mean low RoE. Which is why car makers have historically had low multiples as opposed to SaaS and tech companies in general.
"> Amazon would have been much easier to crush than Tesla will be once it gets its factories online. 

Tesla has its factories online for the most part.  The ones that aren't online will take huge amounts of funding to get online still.

This isn't some magic ""flip the switch"" thing where Tesla will suddenly have things online that weren't previously.  It's all going to take more and more money."
"Quarterly or annual SEC filings, 10-Q and 10-K respectively.  Regulatory requirements include a section titled something like ""Financial Position"" that lays out all the GAAP income, cashflow, and balance sheet items for investors.

For publicly traded American companies, you can usually just do a google search of ""[company] 10-Q"" and find it pretty readily.  For international companies, the same information is generally in an annual report that satisfies local regulatory requirements."

"I'm genuinely curious where you get your information from, because there's a lot of misinformation here.

>The past is the past-- so they ""burned"" through billions (although I call it investing in themselves.) 

Expenses being higher than income by definition is not investing.  You can't invest money that you don't have.

>The fact is, they are selling Model 3s and Ys and are destroying their ICE competition. 

What facts are you looking at?  The C-class sold ~440,000 units last year, compared to ~301,000 Model 3s.  Not really what I'd call ""destroying"" the C-class there.  The Model Y hasn't even been out long enough to get real sales figures, so that's just pure speculation/hype at this point.

Bottom line is this: Tesla has yet to post a profit, and has largely been able to coast on the $20+ billion of external capital.  They're becoming a small player in the industry, but it's unclear what will be sustainable as far as sales, revenue, and ultimately net income and cashflow.

None of that justifies a $185 billion market cap.  It's purely speculation and hype."
"Buyers in this higher price range can be fickle though. The hot new car today isn't always the hot new car for very long and just like how they jumped ship from other luxury brands to Tesla they're also likely to jump ship if another company actually manages to catch up. So far nobody else really committed enough to EVs to get the scale needed to catch up, but that doesn't mean that 10 years out nobody will have managed it. I don't think any other EV can compare right now because of the supercharging network, and AP is clearly still ahead of the publicly available competition. But mobileye has made a ton of progress so I'm not sure this will be the case for that much longer. At least in the US the supercharger network will keep others from easily invading for a while."
"Ah, I forgot the obvious robotaxi thing. I disagree with most of the author's other points though. I see them as putting lots of tech into their cars, but not monetizing the tech itself (aside from a few of the options on their cars, which is fine but still tied to a car purchase)."
"Not at all, I've made good money in the run up.  Just pointing out the facts so that people don't take blatant trolls too seriously."
"""Market cap is just a useful tool to see how much the company itself is worth.""

Again, no. It's a measure of how much the equity is worth. It is not a measure of what the company itself is worth.

""I will be richer than you""

Exactly! You will be richer because *your richness* is what's reflected by ownership equity! But what a company is worth isn't about how enriched the owner's have become. Market cap is about the value held by the owner's of the company. Enterprise value is the value of all of the assets (the entire company) regardless of whether they're being financed with debt or equity.

""the value of a company shouldn‚Äôt jump up and down like that.""

Market Cap jumps up and down *constantly* due to public market enthusiasm and pessimism. Constantly. Especially in Tesla's case. It's quadrupled in a year.

Consider the following. I start a company with one dollar of equity and $999,999 of debt. I use all that capital to invest in a million dollars of productive equipment that produces profitable products. The company is likely worth about $1,000,000. My owner's equity in that company is only worth about $1. The lenders have a claim to the remaining company value if i don't keep up with my debt payments. If someone else wanted to start a perfectly competitive company with the same productive capacity, they'd need to source $1,000,000 (either through debt or equity) to create that company. That's why enterprise value is the better comparison when you want to talk about ""what the company is worth""."
I always assumed one of the big guys would just buy Tesla one day. But I guess I‚Äôm totally wrong. Since it hasn‚Äôt happened.
Yes but without the head what would the body do?
I actually think the opposite as buying when others are buying are a good thing
NKLA has yet to deliver anything besides renderings.  Is that not the definition of vaporware?
Makes sense. UK has a 2035 end to diesel cars. Petrol is on the way out. If your buying in the UK and have money sure. That dies mean it's a more important car than anything else on the road. And not 1000 dollar share price. It's still a very new company with lots of teething problems. It takes months to get the car In the UK.

"As long as you made money, which you did. So celebrate. When I bought the share i had no money. Was broke, but it was a sacrifice that paid off."
"Hold it lol. Best is to set a target price and sell it once it reaches your desired target. Saves money. My guess will be its going to hit 1,400 CAD. Around 1,100 USD. The hype + space X, Starlink, Model Y, and Semis is pushing it up. Hopefully it never falls."

"ya, MSFT has been stagnant in the 20-40 range for a looong time. The recent push to cloud and thus the share price increase only started around 5-7 yrs ago. Thats quite a growth, from $40-$190 in less than 10yrs."

"40 billion in revenue is what Tesla pretty much guided for in 2020 pre Covid. So Tesla is what, one year behind? And they were expecting to be profitable this entire year as well."
"Ok- fair enough so 4 quarters in a row...

True, but understand that Tesla hasn't been ""losing money""- they have been investing it into themselves, heavily, by building a world wide super charging network thats growing exponentially and building new battery factories etc.  They are thinking 10 years down the road, not only the next quarter which is something most companies have forgotten how to do."
">  They are literally just selling regulatory credits which is just some imaginary thing governments created out of thin air.

I drive a Tesla, its not imaginary. I paid money for it. I paid more money for it than it cost Tesla to make it."
"You know a lot more about stocks than I do, so I‚Äôm not trying to critique you on that.

However, Tesla factories are hardly online. Fremont is at capacity. Gigafactory Nevada is at ~70% capacity. Gigafactory Shanghai is under major construction still, tho in the later phases. Gigafactory Buffalo is a mystery but online isn‚Äôt the first word I‚Äôd use for it. Gigafactory Berlin is about to break ground. The new, presumably Texas, factory is going to be announced soon. 

So idk, that‚Äôs an enormous amount of capex, but Tesla is early in its desired ramp. 

I also wonder what you think of Tesla being considered more of an energy company with cars and not a car company solely. Just as Amazon moved into the cloud to make its money and considering it only an online retailer misses most of the point."
"They essentially only have 2 right now (you can probably call Nevada + fremont 1 factory) and only have 500k cars/yr installed capacity with them.  Tesla‚Äôs goal is >40M cars/yr.  if they manage to turn them all into Terawatt level production facilities they‚Äôll probably need 8 or so factories across the world.  2 US 2 EU 2 China and maybe 1 Oceania and 1 India.

This is going to be a massive investment that will be really difficult for the competition to equal.  As long as they‚Äôre paying down their debts, making a little bit of money, and covering the cost of capital  like they are now they are in a fantastic position."

"I don't know what he did but his comment is accurate, people scratch their head not understanding Tesla, I keep reading bs fud from clueless people, the same people will be kicking themselves in few years, it's always the case."
"I mean your company is only worth $1 if that‚Äôs all you have done.

The point is your $999,999 debt should have created more value than the initial investment. Let‚Äôs say you used those 1 million to buy land, materials, and hire people to build a factory, the outcome should be a factory that‚Äôs worth much more than $1,000,000, and once you start generating income you will get hard cold cash as well which also increases your value. Otherwise you can just move money around to buy and sell stuff and suddenly your value goes up and down. 

You have only increased your value when you take some input and make it worth more via investment and transformation (e.g. buying $10 silicon and making $1000 CPU chips)."
Yep. Those rumors always come out. People in this thread rightly point out a typical financial analysts questions- why take on a company $19B in debt and barely turns a profit.

The real test for my risk tolerance will come when the stock hits 4k.
"That varies quite a bit depending on historical volatility of the stock to prevent unintended triggers; and whether I intend to unload all/part of it or not. If it's a long-term hold with solid dividend history then it might be as large as 25%. If it's a short-term position that I intend to exit then it might be as short as 1%.

Also, I generally go relative to the market indexes rather than a calculation on the single stock (I involve human decision for market-wide concerns). If the market drops 10% and the stock drops 8%, then it's ""up"" 2%."

"I would agree that automotive years with e-commerce years is unfair, but I also think this entire comparison is ridiculous.  Amazon is a massive outlier that went about business in a completely different way in a completely different field.

The only reason to compare Amazon to Tesla is to try and pump up Tesla."
Exactly this. Tesla is still a car company. Not a software company. And will eventually be valued as such.
"Good catch, I was looking at the IPO year not the actual year they were founded.  So the first sentence there is at 13 years, not 10."
Capex doesn't show up in income. It's an asset that gets depreciated over time.
"Alright, for the umpteenth time:

**Capital expenditures are not an income statement item.**

By definition, Tesla has not been losing money because of capex.  They spend more on building and selling product than they bring in.  That causes the net loss.  Those investments are *above and beyond* the net loss every year.

Tesla has been ""losing money"".  End of story."
Netflix didn‚Äôt turn a profit for 10 years.
"No, you paid more money for it than it cost Tesla to manufacturer, but not more than it cost to sell.

The costs of selling cars is greater than simply the manufacturing costs."
"> I paid more money for it than it cost Tesla to make it.

Yes, but that's an incredibly low bar to clear.  That's just reiterating that Tesla's gross margins are positive, which has always been true.  The issue is that COGS are not the only costs that exist for a business, particularly for automakers.

Did you pay more than it cost Tesla to develop it, build it, and sell it through their network of stores and service centers?  No, and that's the point here."
What does that have to do with regulatory credits?
"Let me clarify re: being ""online"".

The argument 3-4 years ago (that's still being used) was that Tesla put a massive amount of capex into Fremont and the Gigafactory for Model 3 production.  Those facilities were built out beyond what they needed for the S and X, and so weren't really ""online"" until the Model 3 rolled out.  There was a bit of truth to it then, but at this point, as you said, Fremont is likely at capacity and Nevada is likely close.

My point is this:

>Gigafactory Shanghai is under major construction still, tho in the later phases. Gigafactory Buffalo is a mystery but online isn‚Äôt the first word I‚Äôd use for it. Gigafactory Berlin is about to break ground. The new, presumably Texas, factory is going to be announced soon.

You're right that those plants aren't online, *but they also haven't been paid for*.  It's not a matter of just ""going online"".  All of those examples (with the possible exception of Shanghai) are going to need multibillion dollar investments to get fully ""online"".

As far as the car company vs. energy company thing, most automakers have other businesses.  At the end of the day, the only thing I really care about is where the revenue comes from.  In 2019, 6.2% of Tesla's revenue came from the energy business.  That's just an automaker with a side project.  If they start doing more with the energy products, that could change, but Elon has been promising a multibillion dollar energy business for years now.

As an aside:

>but Tesla is early in its desired ramp.

What is Tesla's desired ramp?  It seems to constantly change.  The Model S was supposed to be the product that made Tesla profitable and paid for development of the Model 3.  That didn't happen. 
 Then the Model X was slotted in as the product that would make Tesla profitable by using the platform of the Model S, and pay for development of the Model 3.  That didn't happen either.  Then the Model 3 was supposed to be the product that filled Fremont/Nevada capacity and made Tesla profitable via economies of scale.  That hasn't happened.  Then the Model Y was supposed to slot in on the same platform of the Model 3 and make Tesla profitable.  It's far too early to judge that one, but there's already a pivot toward other ""ramps"" for semi trucks, pickup trucks, solar panels, you name it.

At this point, I'd just like to see a project that doesn't require outside capital to make it happen.  That's the mark of a solid, sustainable company."
">As long as they‚Äôre paying down their debts, making a little bit of money, and covering the cost of capital like they are now they are in a fantastic position.

I would agree if that were the case, but it's not.  Tesla did finally tip free cash flow positive in 2019, but it came at the cost of *massive* cuts to capex.

Tesla's capex last year was the lowest it's been since *2014*.  It's down 67% since 2017.  That's not a good path to further expansion."
"Still making some fun money playing calls, sorry to disappoint.

It's truly incredible to see ""Tesla isn't worth $185 billion"" equated to ""Tesla hatred"".  There's a word for that mentality, but it's apparently banned on this sub, which really just reinforces that point."
"Not that much.. countries start banning sales of new ones from 2025 up till 2035 for the later ones, and tightening emissions rules are making them increasingly unviable before that - if the market doesn't change first the bans kill the demand for new cars in those markets stone dead.

Sure a lot will still be on the roads, but they're making zero for the manufacturers... to be profitable they need people to be buying new ones."
"Annual profit.  That's all that matters here.  Tesla routinely lumps ZEV sales into specific quarters and has late-year sales pushes to post quarterly profits.  And those have always been cancelled out by losses in other quarters.

But it's telling that this is the only thing you had to say about all that."
"If I had a nickel for every time I've heard that, I could probably buy Tesla.  Every penny stock is ""undervalued and misunderstood"".  It's meaningless without providing any sort of basis and evidence to back it up."
"You keep falling back on this concept of ""your value"". The value of a company is not the amount of money the owner has pulled out of it. It's how much someone would likely pay for it, or that they'd have to pay to create a reasonably similar version. Whether they use equity or debt to do so, they'd have to pay roughly $1,000,000 (plus or minus some value-add due to my entrepreneurial contribution, as you pointed out) to do so. The company is worth way more than $1. The ownership is worth $1."

Both TSLA and NKLA valuations are based on the same things."

"This is exactly what I'm pointing out.  The valuations are not based on the same things at all.  NKLA is pure razzle dazzle.  Tesla actually has incredible products, they've figured out how to manufacture on a large scale, have proven time and time again that they continously improve and iterate.  Perhaps you don't realize this because you don't own a Tesla, but as a Tesla owner I will NEVER buy a non Tesla unless they somehow fuck up everything and regress, which I have not seen any evidence towards.

The thing you don't seem to realize is that TSLA is still a growth stock.  You can't compare it to Value stocks, if you do then don't invest in growth stocks.  Of course they're not going to make sense with fundamentals.  The thing you don't seem to be able to differentiate is a growth stock from a vaporware stock."

Lets agree to disagree.
"Sure, NKLA is *more* razzle dazzle than TSLA just because they don't have a product out right now.  That doesn't change the point that TSLA is still *mostly* razzle dazzle.

How good the product is comes down to subjective opinions.  I've tried out all three at this point, so far none of them blew me away.  Great for an EV, particularly the Model 3, but that's not the entire market.  The only outstanding factor among the three was 0-30 acceleration, but that's about it.

Manufacturing isn't some massive problem that needs to be figured out.  Elon just decided he knew better than everyone else and found out he actually didn't.  Barring NKLA trying to make their own ""alien dreadnought"" and similarly flopping it, manufacturing shouldn't be a huge drama.  It's just a matter of bringing in people who know their shit and letting them do it for you.

As far as the owner thing, why would I own one if it didn't impress me?  For every /u/juggle that swears they'll never buy anything else, there's a /u/nycman123 that swears they'll never buy another Tesla.  So which one am I supposed to believe?  The Model 3 was supposedly a dominant product for Tesla, but 3 years in it's still being handily outsold by the C-class and 3-series.

I'm not comparing Tesla today to a value stock.  I just don't see a path from here to a $185 billion valuation.  Those companies tend to do $200+ billion in revenue and net $10+ billion in profit every year.  As of last year, Tesla still needed outside capital to try and get the Model Y going.  That's a big problem for a $185 billion dollar company to have.

My point here is that like NKLA, the valuation on TSLA is based entirely around the razzle dazzle concepts panning out flawlessly and making them a major player in every aspect.  It's based on hype and speculation, not anything concrete."

"Again, it's truly incredible to see ""Tesla isn't worth $185 billion"" equated to ""Tesla hatred"".

If you still don't agree with the advantage of hindsight that Tesla has been overvalued and has been close to going out of business in the past, you're just being willfully ignorant.  Every single time that I've said Tesla would need to raise cash within 6-12 months to survive, they've done exactly that, for exactly those reasons.  For all your complaining about people thinking entirely with emotion, that's all you're doing here.

It's a fact that Tesla has had to raise money multiple times just to survive.  It's a fact that Tesla was close to going out of business multiple times.  Those are such indisputable facts that even the narcissistic asshole that runs the company admits them.  But for some inexplicable reason, you still plug your ears, deny it all, and scream about the haters and the shorts out to get you.

It's not called hatred, it's just called not being a blind apostle."
"That article is talking about one specific market.  Of course Tesla does exceptionally well in their own backyard, where the subsidies heavily favor them.  I'm talking about global sales figures.

"Well, that video isn‚Äôt close to what tesla has to offer. You may not know what Tesla cars can do with autonomy these days."
"Again, your own emotions are causing you to project upon other people.  Where have I ever said anyone is ""out to get me""?  I am absolutely aware of the warts that Tesla and Musk have.  However, 100% of your posts about Tesla and Musk are negative.  I absolutely acknowledge Tesla was a hairs width away from bankruptcy in 2018.  I absolutely acknowledge that Musk posts stupid shit on Twitter.  But I also say that my Model 3 is the best car I've ever had and is like having an iPhone for the first time.  I also believe in transitioning to sustainable transportation.  Which is why I invested in the company.  I think I am like many on this sub, who believe in the product and the mission of Tesla.

No one wants to listen to someone who is negative and hateful 100% of the time.  I hope your entire life isn't consumed with the hatred that you project against Musk and Tesla.  Have a great day!"
"See, this is where you're using your bias against the facts. 

Tesla is production constrained, once Berlin Giga is up and running, it will be a different story."
"Again, based on....?

You'll have to forgive me for not just taking your word on it."
"Setting aside the other lies about post history, etc....

> I absolutely acknowledge Tesla was a hairs width away from bankruptcy in 2018.

Yet you were just dismissing that as hatred.  So which was it?  Hating on Tesla?  Or just stating a fact about Tesla?

It's also funny that you continue to accuse me of being a hater, but at the end of the day this:

> I also believe in transitioning to sustainable transportation. Which is why I invested in the company. I think I am like many on this sub, who believe in the product and the mission of Tesla.

is the entire reason I invested in Tesla in 2012 and why I'm still subscribed here despite the ridiculousness that gets posted here.

But there's a difference between believing in a goal and blindly following someone just because they claim that's their goal."
"No, it's just not a fact.  Facts have to be based on evidence.  What evidence is there that the (relatively) lower global sales is due to a production constraint?

Tesla has always seen large US sales and small sales elsewhere.  I would argue the Model 3 isn't production constrained, seeing as they're pushing the Model Y out ahead of schedule and pulling demand levers for it already.  You would expect a focus on Model 3 production if the supply was the constraint there.  But regardless, let's use a different example.  The Model S isn't production constrained, I'm sure we can agree on that.  I haven't checked the numbers for 2019, but [through the end of 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S#Sales_and_markets) Tesla had sold ~263,000 globally.  ~144,000 of those sales were US, meaning ~55% of all Model S sales were domestic.  Based on 2019, 51.5% of Model 3 sales are domestic.

I'm not seeing any reason to expect Model 3 sales to surge globally when S and X sales haven't."
"Lol.  So are you now claiming you like Elon Musk?  Or just being negative for the millionth time?

You invested in Tesla in 2012 but in the past you have stated you long ago sold your investment.  So in the meantime you have become a hater.  Nice try though ""trying"" to be positive.

Thanks for confirming your bias against Tesla and Musk.  You are incapable of competent objective analysis here.

PS It wasn't a lie about your post history.  You have been claiming Tesla is going out of business for years.  In case you don't know how Reddit works, comment history is not saved for more than 2 years.  I'm guessing you already knew that though..."
"You didn't answer my question.  You accuse me of being a hater based on repeatedly saying that Tesla would need to raise cash within 6-12 months to survive.  Yet not only was that correct each time and exactly what happened, we supposedly agree that it was just a fact.  So which was it?  A fact or just hating?  For someone who says I'm incapable of competent objective analysis, you're not being very competent or objective with this one.

I think I've been pretty clear on my opinion of Elon Musk.  He's just another rich asshole cut from the same cloth as the big orange White House buffoon (since his name is banned here) and doing the same thing: co-opting a movement for the sake of making himself a big deal and making his wallet a little fatter.  And it seems like every bad thing about Tesla, from pushing NDAs on customers for warranty work to suing people over critical reviews to all the manufacturing debacles, finds its root with him.  He's the biggest problem with Tesla, by far at this point.

I did sell my investment long ago when the whole Model X debacle rolled out, I just play with calls now.  So my only potential financial ""bias"" is in Tesla's share price going up.

> In case you don't know how Reddit works, comment history is not saved for more than 2 years.

why isnt it on plugshare.  I dont think they have anything and this makes it weirder.   Only the caravan park on the other side of town offers charging with a low power 24a plug by the look of it.

"Therefore, the only conclusion possible: this is the work of extraterrestrials."
"Adelaide. If you're building things on any kind of meaningful scale in Australia you build them in Adelaide. The entire city is built for manufacturing and has been ever since the old colonial days. It's where Holden used to make most of their cars before the Canberra nuked the entire Australian manufacturing industry.

Port Melbourne is well and truly over capacity. It's so far over capacity that a trans-continental railway is under construction to Port Brisbane from Port Melbourne right now in order to take some of the load off. It is easier to build a high capacity, double-high container fast train across half a continent, connecting two separate and incompatible rail networks and building an entirely new line straight through the densest part of a city of 2.5 million people, than it is to move more stuff through Port Melbourne.

Seriously, if you're going to build things in Australia then you're going to build them in Adelaide. You probably wouldn't build a gigafactory in Australia in the first place though."
"Gippsland is a rural dairy area where the only major transportation linkage are trucks and no major population centers.

If you wanted to build a gigafactory near Gippsland your be better off putting it either in the Latrobe Valley where you could transition/retrain workers from coal power stations to manufacturing, or actual south east Melbourne around Pakenham where the land is cheap but you have access to the whole population of Melbourne. 

Leongatha is the worst of all world's for major manufacturing, and I say that as a Leongatha local"
"Just to add on, Leongatha is pretty rural. It's about a 2 hour drive from Melbourne itself and there isn't much infrastructure beyond trucks.

So it'd be difficult to find workers and even more difficult to bring supplies to and from the factory."
"It‚Äôs there but not there when you really zoom in, so...."

"Thanks for the inside!

You are talking about the *Inland Railway*?

‚ÄúThe 1700km long Inland Railway (under construction) has about 300km of dual gauge.‚Äú
Why are there different rail gauges in Australia?

And thats just half upwards the east coast. 

Woah! That‚Äôs massive and expansive! 

Just realized how freaking large Australia really is again! 


Thats as far as London to Gibraltar or Berlin to Moskau ü§Ø"
"As an Adelaidean, I'd love for that to be true. We've got plenty of space up north and this would actually give the state government a reason to pursue the Adelaide Hills Rail Bypass project. We do have plenty of former car manufacturing workers and other people experienced in other technologies, since most of the young adults flee the state when they're done with their studies/when they can.

This would definitely give the local industry a kick in the butt again :D**"
There used to be a train but that's been shut down for ages. It'll probably never come back.
That next zoomed-in level is much older. Look at the lack of development further south-east from the logo. It's clear the logo was created sometime between the dates of those two sets of images.

Actually that makes a lot of sense and no I wasn‚Äôt thinking too hard about it lol
"Australia originally wasn't a single thing. Prior to federation each colony was responsible for their own railway network.

New South Whales, importing engineers from London, had a standard gauge network. Victoria with money from gold had a mix of standard and more expensive broad gauge track. Queensland's first line was built in narrow gauge both to save money on smaller tunnels and bridges and in order to better negotiate an incline between Brisbane and Toowoomba. The rest of the Queensland's tracks were built out to be comparable with trains for that first line and because narrow gauge trains are relatively cheap and negotiate hazards easily Queensland built a lot of track very quickly. After federation when it came time to connect the networks, NSW standard gauge track was chosen for the Trans-Australian line but Queensland had already built a titanic narrow gauge network. Adelaide and Perth kept their narrow gauge commuter trains (both of which were originally built to accommodate trams) but have standard for freight, Victoria is in the process of replacing their broad gauge trains with standard but Queensland's narrow gauge network is so expansive that it's just easier to build switching yards at the places were it meets with other states or piggyback things if you want to travel from one network to another.

There's currency one standard gauge line in Queensland connecting Sydney to Brisbane but it shares track with local commuter trains a~~nd also doesn't go to Port Brisbane~~ (Edit: It totally goes to Port Brisbane)- it's mostly for passengers on the NSW Transport XPT service, not freight. The Inland Rail will connect Melbourne to Port Brisbane via Toowoomba where there'll either be a switching yard or continue on to Port Brisbane on dedicated, standard gauge freight tracks. A third connection is in the planning phase connecting the Alice Springs to Darwin line to Mt.Isa with a switching yard but that's still under investigation on account of it has to go through an Aboriginal heritage site and might not actually be profitable."
"Haha the most reliable opinion any south gippslander has is moaning about the train being shut down ;)

It does.  The Standard Gauge line comes into Acacia Ridge and then goes to PoB via the Cleveland suburban line, branching off at Wynnum.  It's almost unused, however."

"The efficiency of my 2019 Raven is amazing, but it really does depend a great deal on traffic - if I'm following almost any car, I get good numbers up to around 75 to 80 mph, but with nothing to break the air ahead, it's about 20% worse."
Think that Tesla and the EPA are still fighting as it is not on the EPA site.
"It looks like some range has been applied retroactively as well. I received 2020.12.20 last week and my range display went up about 9%. 

At 100% that should read 402 if my math is right. My car is Model S Long Range built in December.  I haven't had any reason to charge to 100% since I've owned it though.

I highly doubt it would actually get 402. I don't have the newer wheels that came out with the Long Range +.

(Yes I did check to make sure the range settings weren't changed)"
"Maybe this was previously announced and I missed it, but can the Model S/X utilize V3 supercharging now? The Tesla post was promoting its expansion of V3 supercharging, but my understanding was that only the Y and 3 can actually leverage that higher rate of charge."
"It's a bit odd that everyone is talking about how aggressive EPA estimates are. If you were to look at the EPA rating discussion on other EVs, there were a lot of people talking about how conservative EPA estimates were, and that they didn't line up with real world driving data.

Not saying that anyone is wrong here, but what's going on? Is EPA just not a good standard because it doesn't align with real world data very well? Is it really the case that EPA's standards somehow give Tesla much higher numbers while hurting other manufacturers significantly?"
"Not to diminish the awesomeness of the news. But just wanted to add, 402 miles, at least on day 1. 

My model 3 is at 91% capacity after only 20,000 miles. (Yeah, I‚Äôve tried running the battery down to 5% and fully charging it but continues to max out at ~297 miles (rated at 325 miles) and seems accurate in usage)."
"Well, so they say. Meanwhile my ""supposedly"" 322 mile model 3 is getting 170 miles of real time driving range.

Edit 1: Being downvoted for what I'm truly getting. Ok...

Edit 2: Wow, thanks for the silver. Didn't think I would receive a reward for such a simple comment."
I have also seen reports that the larger turbine wheels decrease efficiency too. Up to 20% additional range at the worst. Luckily my ‚Äô15 MS doesn't seem to be affected too greatly by the wheels üòã
"I'll be interested when they actually put a new cabin in the Model S, up the quality, and improve the exterior.  The lack of a HUD is poor.  Matrix LEDs in Europe too.  I should also add that I fully support Tesla and all the great aspects of them.  Amazing range."
"This is a good start, 400 miles seems to be the target number to get people out of range anxiety. So even at 80% recommended charge, that should get you 320 miles, which is about the same as a gas car's range when the low-on-fuel light comes on.

The problem is the Model S is a 75K car. Putting Tesla's potential savings math aside, few people can afford a 75K car. If Tesla can put this 400 mile range in a sub 40K car, which is Model 3, then it is game over for ICE cars. Many people can afford the Model 3. And for those that want an even cheaper EV, used Model 3 will flood market soon as 2018-2019 owners will look to sell so that they can upgrade to Model Y or even Model S."
"They need to move away from a definite number because it's misleading. If you have an EV you know your real world range is far less than the EPA range. The range should indicate your real world mileage to the maximum theoretical mileage, which is about a 20% deviation."
"EPA caught red handed. üòÇ Also, didn‚Äôt know that technology hardware would have device logs. #idiots Sounds like someone has an interest in big oil."
"And by officially they mean ""because Tesla says so"""
Does this mean there will be a sw update for cars sold this year that will update the miles remaining in the charge display?
"I‚Äôve been watching Tesla for a long time, and honestly, even though this is a wee bit trivial... it‚Äôs pushed me over the edge.  I want a model S now haha."
there was a question based on article about an EV‚Äôs range on my practice SAT yesterday
"This is fricking amazing. My S90D is down to 293 range, I am so envious! On another note, I HATE it when the word ""barrier"" is used like this. It's a milestone, not a barrier! /rant"

So both Model 3 and Model S both get 400 miles with a 100kwh battery? That doesn't sound right at all...
That is about 647km for those using the metric system.
"The article on CNN is garbage - https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/17/success/tesla-model-s-long-range-400-miles/index.html

>(CNN)Tesla announced late Monday that its new Model S Long Range Plus sedan became the first electric car to be certified by the EPA to drive more than 400 miles on a single charge.
But that milestone may not actually mean that much to consumers.
A number of electric vehicles already on the market get more than 200 miles of range, which many experts feel is enough to give car shoppers sufficient comfort.
A game changer is coming for electric car owners 
A game changer is coming for electric car owners
""For an EV, anything over 200 miles is going to be more than enough for almost everybody,"" said Sam Abuelsamid, an EV industry analyst with the consulting firm Guidehouse Insights.
And for those car shoppers that still aren't comfortable, even with a driving range of more than 200 miles, the jump to 400 isn't going to help, said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with Edmunds.com.
""That difference between 100 to 200 is great, but 300 to 400 maybe is less impactful,"" she said.


Seriously? A lot of people were saying before that Teslas have less range and you can't drive anywhere outside town because of ""range anxiety"". 

Now that no one else is close to Tesla's range while Tesla has cracked the 400mi barrier, suddenly this doesn't matter anymore? 

I mean, who pays for this article? The auto industry? The competitors?"
"They're making progress, that's for sure!

Double that and I can seriously think about getting an EV."
"Great news!  I just picked up a 2020 LR+ about 2 months ago, extra range is always welcome for ""Space Shadow."""

"Driving in heavy rain killed it for me. Recently did a large trip and as part of it, went from the Savannah GA supercharger to the St Augustine supercharger, a distance of only 171 miles. I charged up to ~~~270~~ 230 miles, thinking that would be plenty, plus there's 3 other superchargers en route just in case.

It rained pretty hard pretty much the whole time. I usually set the cruise control to 77, and I did leave it there for a while even after it started warning me to keep it under 75, figuring I'd just go to the St. Johns supercharger instead. Except I plugged that in to GPS, and it still was projecting I'd make it with only 30 miles, which continued to drop as I watched, even as I reduced speed to 74. Eventually had to reroute to the Jacksonville supercharger, which I did make but with only 20 miles remaining. I used ~~250~~ 210 miles of rated range to go 145 miles, which is pretty crap. My Wh/mi was around ~~320~~ 341.

Hence why I'm all for big batteries with unnecessarily large (400+ mile) rated ranges-- it means you can introduce some inefficiencies without being totally screwed. No idea what I would have done had I been driving an SR or SR+-- probably would have had to have stopped at Kingsland, but I got lucky there were even so many chargers on my route!

EDIT: misremembered a few numbers. Screenshot from Teslafi [here.](https://i.imgur.com/gicQ7Il.png)"
So few people consider aerodynamics when talking about range. It really does matter what you're driving behind.
"Even in my Raven S Perf, I‚Äôm able to get 100% efficiency when driving like a normal human being lol. Even with the 21‚Äù dual turbines. I have proof in my teslafi logs."
"to benefit from drag requires unsafe following distance, per myth busters"
"Don‚Äôt argue with a guy who has logs

CEO Elon Musk said that the 2020 Model S Long-Range Plus should already have had a 400 mile range. He added that the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) had messed up earlier tests by leaving the car door open and the keys in the car, costing the test vehicle two percent in range. While the EPA denied that claim, ***Musk responded in a tweet that ‚Äúwe have precise car logs that confirm it happened.‚Äù*** At the time, he added that the Model S would ‚Äúeasily‚Äù beat the 400 mile range once a retest was allowed."
It's been up at least since last night:  [https://i.imgur.com/vOB3X58.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vOB3X58.jpg)
It‚Äôs on the site
"The Raven has been able to go to 200kW for a while, not as much as the 250kW of the 3/Y, but more than the 150kW of the older S/X.

Edit: kw, not A!"
Our X was reporting speeds of like 870 miles an hour of charging when we used one. It charged crazy quick. So I‚Äôm pretty sure at least newer X and S models can use it.
"It's all relative. If you're just driving city miles then EPA is conservative, if you're driving fast on the highway it's not. I expect those other drivers are trying to maximize range or drive their cars as commuter cars, especially the EVs with less range. Tesla drivers also tend to drive it like they stole it, if we drive in chill mode we'd get much better range."
">Is it really the case that EPA's standards somehow give Tesla much higher numbers while hurting other manufacturers significantly?

I can say that with certainty when it comes to Tesla vs Porsche. People are getting just over 300 real world miles on the Taycan 4s yet EPA had it rated about 60-80miles less yet people struggle to reach the EPA claims for Tesla vehicles. Something is definitely off"
"My wife drives like a 90yr old, and she gets 266 wh/m for the past 18,000 miles.  Broken down, would be 282 miles for a 310 range epa estimate"
"My AWD 3 is capping out at 289. ~25,000 miles on ODO."
"Don't feel bad, my AWD 3 had been stuck at 290miles max range for a year now. I was finally starting to accept it but then I just updated to 2020.20.12 and now it maxes out at 280 miles.  Lost another 10 miles instantly.  I'm at 40k miles."
"Our 2015 S with 80k miles still charges to 259. Less than 3% loss. However, a lot of older 85 models are capped which is Tesla being straight up unethical and stealing from the owners. 

It's possible they are capping newer cars as well, or that they were overly optimistic with the initial numbers for PR purposes. Maybe the newer battery chemistry is worse like the 90 models."
"Weird, my July 2018 Model 3 still charges to 313 miles (new was 310)."
"Either your driving habits are very aggressive, the weather is extreme where you live, or somethings wrong.  I recently did 297 miles on one charge on my 2017 Model 3 LR RWD."
"Think of the epa rating is what you get if you drive like your grandma... slow and steady and you will eventually get there...also if the wind looks at your car funny, your car will get scared and range will be reduced. oh and use your regen as much as possible."
"170 miles?

Do a live stream range test because this seems highly improbable"
"I don't know about Model 3, but Model S is pretty accurate. Although we had customers hell bent on showing us that the car has no range. They maxed out the car on the German Autobahn and then complained about only getting 90km range. They came out pretty stupid looking when we showed them the logs of kw usage being maxed out."
What‚Äôs your watts per mile use?
"Because your statement is vague and without details.  If you live in a cold city and have the heat on, that will destroy range.  If you drive aggressively, or 90 on the freeway, that will also lower range.  

Are you charging to the recommending 80-85% on your battery daily, then yea, you won't get the full amount.  If you are charing to 100% daily, you are damaging your battery..."
"I feel you man... Since I gotten mine... My model 3 has never charged over 298 miles. It maxes out at 298... No more despite how long I leave it on the charger. And I'm told the same old scripted responses; you must be driving like a maniac, etc. I don't drive like a maniac at all."
Not supposed to. Would have to be extreme conditions.
https://teslike.com/
are you towing another model 3?
">Edit: Being downvoted for what I'm truly getting. Ok...

Don't bitch about how reddit works. You knew that when you wrote this comment. 

It's true that Tesla's vehicles demonstrate the down-sides of  the EPAs testing regimen. I have found (over my last three Tesla vehicles) that using Autopilot at no more than 5 or 10 over the speed limit will almost always result in rated mileage or better, unless you're needing extreme levels of climate control."
"Yikes. Mine was rated at 310 when new, and after only 15k miles I'm expected to only get 290 miles, which I thought was pretty bad. Charged up once to 100%, and 290 seemed about right. Real world I dunno, as I rarely get 100% efficiency."
I've driven my Model 3 327 miles on a charge before and routinely do 250 miles. Normally I Supercharge before then because of my bladder.
"That‚Äôs like 50% efficiency. Even when I drive 80+ on the highway I get ~65%. Worst I have even gotten on a drive is 60%. Source: teslafi. 

You must drive you car really hard/fast. 

That‚Äôs fine, of course, but realize you would get bad mileage out of an ICE too."
170 is very low even for a 3P. I'm getting around 220mi. Average 330Wh/mi
"I bet you got 15mpg on your 30mpg rated ICEV as well.

Poor driving skill and maintenance will lead to poor range. It's no surprise."
"Sorry, you can‚Äôt oppose the hive mind."
"The interior is definitely looking old now. Needs a big update and huge quality upgrade. It was ok to forgive that when the car was new and they were a fairly new company. Now they have made proper profit, they should be held to the same standards as the German manufacturers"
You can buy nice aftermarket HUDs for ~50 bucks off amazon.  It is definitely due for a redesign though.  I'm waiting to pull the trigger on one until they do.
The difference is that no one cares about gas tank range in ICE cars because it takes a negligible time to refuel.  A lot of people don't want the additional time added to road trips to recharge.
"No, that's not what it means."
"Where are you driving? That would get you from Los Angeles to Salem, OR in one go."
"My BMW ICE has a range of 550 - 600 km (340 - 375 miles), so the Tesla beats it. Are you driving a diesel?"
"Do you have specific regular long-range driving needs, or is this just a general concern?

Most people I speak to, once we have a conversation about it, come around to understanding just how much better a 300-mile EV is over a 500-mile ICE."
"This will also change. For example german car manufacturers (VW, Mercedes) started to put smaller tanks in their cars to save on weight. Those cars have tanks of 40-45 liters. Diesels will still have enough range but gasoline cars are coming closer to current electric ranges."
Not me. I like my 3. I plan to trade it in when they make significant changes.  But not waiting to go electric if you really want to go electric is silly.
"That's a very extreme drop.

In such heavy rain, you didn't slow down below 70MPH? I usually do 65MPH at most in moderate rain. In heavy rain, traffic usually slows to 40-50MPH because visibility is so bad. Maybe we use different definitions of heavy rain though."
"> No idea what I would have done had I been driving an SR or SR+

Slow down?"
75 in heavy rain is asking for serious trouble.
"Not as bad as a trip I took across northern Indiana into a 25mph headwind when temps were in the low teens. I still went 80 and it was just over 360wh/mi. I eventually had to slow down because I wasn't going to make it to the next charger, arrived at like 4%. 

According to TeslaFi I only had 60% efficiency. Although looking at the numbers yours is pretty bad! Although I have noticed even slight rain can be killer."
Hello fellow Georgian!
"Probably the speed more than the rain. I find that you can‚Äôt really get the rated range if you‚Äôre driving over 65mph in the awd variants unless you‚Äôre pseudo-drafting behind a large suv or truck. The RWD probably does a little bit better.

At 77mph you get huge range loss unfortunately"
"I have Scan my Tesla which shows real-time Wh/mile and breaking my own wind might be 240Wh/mile but as soon as someone moves in front of me (maybe 6 car lengths) the it drops down to about 170-180Wh/mile.

If you're trying to stretch range, set the follow distance to 1 and put the cruise speed to like 90mph so that you're always right behind them."
[deleted]
"It doesn't, per my experience.  I just set autopilot to 1 which still keeps me far back enough people will cut in front."
Lmao
Hey....I shut the door ok
So funny of people to try to scam something that self logs so much stuff. like top gears trying to pretend it broke down.
Its entirely possible the door sensor malfunctioned and incorrectly marked it as open (if Musk isn't lying).
I meant that it's not on EPA's site.
Only M3 LR can go to 250A right? Std range can't.
"Yep, that's the update I missed üòÄ"
"But that's all controlled in the sense that the EPA tests all of these cars in the same way.

It sounds like people are just pointing out the situations that are more favorable to their conclusion that's already in their head, then? Because we have people complaining about EPA being aggressive here, and people complaining about EPA being conservative with other cars"
This right here. Other than PHEVs I very rarely see a non tesla EV on  long stretches of highway.
"iirc its because of battery voltage 375v with tesla and 800v with taycan. So tesla have better efficiency in low speed which EPA test, while taycan is better in higher speed. And ppl usually drive these car fast."
she must drive with the seat heaters on and the ac set to max!
I get 240 wh/m over 60K miles on a Model 3 LR RWD that is rented out via Turo (so wide variety of users).  Personally I get about 200-220 wh/m.  Mostly flat terrain.  SoCal.
Looks like similar loss...your rated range is 322 miles. I thought range loss would go slower. Even my Nissan LEAF dropped range slower than the Model 3! Hopefully it will be stable at 10% loss for awhile.
"Sigh. My S60 has 90k miles and I've lost a lot of range. It's 170 max now, where it started at 210. It makes certain SC trips really suck."
"I think it cannot always be blamed on the driver or their driving style. My Model S (2020 LR Model) is supposed to get close to 600 km on a single charge, and I only get around 450 km. Battery is fine, car is practically new and no, I'm not driving like a maniac. But what people do not take into account is that there are people who don't drive a lot every day, let's say just 10-15 km a day, and the car mostly just sits around for 2-4 weeks until it needs to be charged again. While sitting around, it loses so much energy that this adds up to the bad numbers. People often ignore the fact that even without Sentry mode on, a Tesla loses up to 1-2% of battery charge depending on where it sits during the night - I've never had an ICE which lost that amount of fuel over night, just as a comparison. So yes, if I drove 600 km in one go then maybe my actual range would be closer to the EPA advertised range but for people whose cars sit around for extended times, this rated range is just not realistic and it has nothing to do with people driving like maniacs."
at what average speed? 297 is not realistic at highway speeds
"I'm getting an average of 224whr per mile. Mostly highway driving at 80mph. LR AWD 19"" rims.

Exit: I can see how this is confusing. My average kwr is 224. When I'm in the city my kwr is 198, on the highway my kwr is 284kwr."
">engadget.com/tesla-...

">somethings wrong

*something's"
Does anyone know what the kwh/km or kwh/m is of a S or 3 at 65 mph? Cause that is what I'm willing to drive as my slowest divided highway speed.
"My model 3 has been dead on, unless its super cold out."
"I'm charging up to 80%. Lately I've been doing 70%. However I did try to charge up to 100% one time to let it go down to around 10% and then charge back up to 100 and only got around 170 mi. I did that twice and I'm still confused to why it did that. I'll do it again since it is much hotter out than when I was doing it earlier, when it was 70¬∞ F."
"298 out of 322 is completely normal. EPA ratings are **always** too high, just like when ICE cars advertise consumption like 4l/100km but actually do closer to 6. 

Those rating should only be looked at when comparing cars, not estimating actual range. You have to look at reviewers for that."
What are you supposed to get?
"The battery meter on teslas work completely different than other BEVs, they are set at a pre determined wh/m, so it's not very accurate, you could be spending more wh/m or less but the car displays according to the pre determined number. You can although see in the ""energy"" tab more accurate numbers"
Cycle it ~0-100% a few times and it‚Äôll show better than 298.
"They don't use the EPA range in the cars software because it's unrealistic. Your driving style doesn't matter for the displayed range, it's based as a constant. They use a Wh/mi number that closer resemble (very ideal) real-world performance."
Is it the Model 3 Perf? Cos that‚Äôs 299 miles with the 20 inch wheels.
"Right, he's being downvoted because if he was actually getting 170 miles in typical conditions, Tesla would replace his battery for free.

It's normal to only get 170 if you're driving 90mph and have AC or heat blasting."
"I don't drive fast, believe it or not. I'm very soft on the pedal. Heck, I don't even run the AC unit and it's 95F here in Colorado."
"Actually no I got about 35 on my 2014 Toyota Camry. Get around 450 miles of range.

Edit: Another fact I'm getting on my Toyota and I'm being downvoted for it? Ok redditers."
It's nice to see people taking my criticism well.  I agree.
"Imagine buying a 100k car so you can install a hud for 50 bucks cause they don't even give you the option to get one from the factory.
Totally unacceptable in that price range."
"There is only one aftermarket HUD likely worth looking at and that's Hudway Drive which isn't released yet.  They will make one specifically to fit Teslas.  However that isn't the point.  It should come with at least the option to have one already.  The excuse that we they all be self driving soon anyway doesn't cut the mustard, isn't true, and doesn't negate information being projected."
"Yeah you won't care until your fuel gauge stops working ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ 
How are you going to know how much gas you have if you don't know how much you can hold? 
Btw every gasoline car I've ever seen eventually gets to many miles and the gas gauge stops working. 
After 250,000 miles if the gas gauge works thats a miracle."
"Yes, it does.  the EPA doesn't do independent testing."

"No, I only slowed down when it got so heavy I (and AP) couldn‚Äôt see. This was a early AM Sunday, so not much traffic on the roads. 

That said, I misremembered a couple things. Screengrab from Teslafi [here.](https://i.imgur.com/gicQ7Il.png)

* I juiced to 230, not 270. So 210 miles of rated range to go 147 miles. 

* Wh/mi was 341, not 320

Still, pretty dang bad for what should have been a pretty easy drive."
"Never! I drive 77 basically everywhere except surface streets, regardless of speed limit."
"In all seriousness, this depends a lot on the road, the road surface, time of day, and other factors which can also affect visibility, reaction and traction."
"Not really, it‚Äôs a heavy car with good tires. I took over from AP so I could feel if it was stepping out of line, and correct as necessary. Think I slowed to ~60 at the heaviest few moments where I could barely even see."
"Texan actually!

It was a very long trip...."
An ev is most efficient rolling at like 10mph with no stop and go.
"Not stomping it at every light, in warmer weather with no rain and with autopilot 60% of the way I‚Äôve gotten 270Wh/mi. Under normal driving In the summer I get 70-80% efficiency which is not bad. In the winter it‚Äôs more like 30-40%"
"you allow enough space so that people will cut you off? what did you do to them lol?

on a serious note, i agree you feel safe. for me, higher autopilot following settings seems like they give the car more time to stop... behind me. if i can give that driver half a second extra to start slowing down that may or may not be texting on their phone, i‚Äôll give them that time any day"
"He isn't joking either.

Years ago, a New York Times reporter lied and pretended to run out of power on a ""review"" and he released the logs showing not only did he not run of power, but that he drove in circles *trying* to before getting frustrated and calling for a tow any way.  

They started logging like that after Top Gear admitted in court to faking a dead battery for the sake of making an entertaining skit."
He was probably obsessing about those car doors around the same time he was obsessing about SpaceX's historic manned mission into space.
they really didnt understand the whole its a computer on wheels aspect of tesla at the time.
"I would assume that if that was the case, the door would have shown as open throughout the drive as well."
"ah, gotcha. I hope Tesla confirmed the numbers with them before putting them online üòÇ"
"Yeah, that's right. M3 SR is about 160kW max (source: [https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/v3-supercharging-profiles-for-model-3.155606/page-10#post-3845892](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/v3-supercharging-profiles-for-model-3.155606/page-10#post-3845892))

Edit: kw, not A!"
I think that's exactly what's happening.
"There is also the issue of wheels/tires. EPA numbers are always going to be with the smallest most efficient wheel tire combo offered (on any car tested). Anytime you go bigger or wider (which I would argue is much more common on Teslas than other EVs) your range is gonna drop.

Also people rarely check their tire pressures, anyone complaining about range that can't tell you what PSI they are running right now doesn't deserve to complain."
"This has nothing to do with battery voltages, the taycan has two gears which makes it much more efficient when going faster.
The Epa test is so slow that it never get into the 2nd gear."
"She doesn't have the single motor dude.  And 266 is VERY low.  Screensnap, and share, if you would, via imgur upload, your wh/m since you first bought the car.  Lowest I've ever seen was 258.  She also has the awd,  probably takes a bit more energy?

What is yours for LIFE of vehicle (not cherry picked)?
She doesn't use seat heaters, and runs ac at 70 to 74"
Not bad at all. Slightly lower than the EPA estimates.
I think it‚Äôs 322 for the newer ones. But it was 310 when I got mine. So it‚Äôs probably still going off that. But who knows
Just saying: The first bar of the nissan leaf is 15 % and not 7.5 %.
How many miles? We‚Äôre not going to buy another Tesla. Spending 100k to be treated like crap is no fun. Our battery range is still good but SC speeds take more than 2x as long. It‚Äôs ridiculous. We used to enjoy road trips and now we dread the supercharging stops.
People that own Teslas should always have them plugged in while at home. It's good for the battery.  \*Edit to clarify - it's in the owner's manual!
"Wow. I routinely get 424km range on Model S 85d 's while driving normal European speeds. I really hoped that the newer ones would get noticeably better ranges.

I agree, sitting around kills range. Especially if you leave the car ""on"" to receive telemetry from it. We started to leave them plugged in and charging at the slowest setting and to 50%-80% while stored to keep from draining the battery, while preserving battery life.

It's like a cell phone. Plug it in for opportunistic charging when in range of an electrical cord."
you're suppose to put it on the charger at night.....
"I mean, you're technically not wrong (and I think Tesla's suffer from vampire drain more than others), but when most people talk about an EV's range, they mean ""how far can you drive immediately after charging to 100%"", not ""how far can you drive after the car has been sitting for some indeterminate amount of time"".

Taken to the logical extreme, your Model S actually has a range of 0 km because the battery heater would drain the battery in less than a week if leave it sitting in an industrial freezer."
The rated range - is based on mixed driving test. You can drive longer than rated range on basically any EV if you drive slow enough. Normal long range driving is usually on highway - and the car will be an overachiever if it‚Äôs range get close to the rated range.
My Model 3 loses about 1%/week if it's just sitting in the garage.
"450km is 75% efficiency which sounds about right, since EPA rating is based on very slow and easy driving (even highway test is only 55mph). 

The same is true for a ICE car, you rarely get the highway rated range unless you drive very slow."
What the fuck is that argument? The stated range is wrong because it doesn‚Äôt take into account overnight battery loss? Who cares? Maximum Range only matters when you‚Äôre on a road trip and need to plan accordingly.
"Probably averaged at 65mph, half the trip at 60, half the trip at 72."
224 whr per mile is around 310 miles on 70 kwhr battery or 224 miles on 50 kwhr battery. So obviously what you are claiming in terms of range smells bad. Either you are not sharing info or also claiming the battery software is faulty alongwith battery?
Something isn‚Äôt lining up then.  224 @ 80mph should get you roughly 300 miles.
"Something is definitely wrong - either with your specific vehicle or with your numbers.

My 2019 Model 3 Performance, during a Minnesota winter (0F +/-30F w/wind and snow) averaging 80mph typically runs around 350Wh/mile.  On a 70kWh battery - the same as yours - that's 200 miles of range. The Performance is also less efficient than yours, so you should be easily getting >200 miles range on average, and definitely closer to rated on better days.

Heck, 224Wh/mile, on a 70kWh battery, is 312 miles just from the math alone,  almost double your stated 170 miles, implying your battery is only at 54% of it's specified capacity if your numbers are accurate.  Are you maybe getting closer to 270?  Or maybe not looking at 100% battery range (e.g. 20% to 80%, where people typically keep their batteries at, would be 60% capacity - pretty close to the 54% noted above)?"
"You won‚Äôt get full range at 80 mph. Check out Teslike or the Bjorn tests. They also assume 18‚Äù Aeros in those tests. 

I‚Äôm in a warm climate with the dual motor aero setup and typically do better than rated range in mixed driving, a little lower at 75 mph. (~280 miles 100-0%)

E: not sure what is meant by kwr and whr - wh/m?) 

If you‚Äôre measuring in miles there is a huge mismatch between the readout and your real range."
"But OP said his usage was in the 220s and he was getting 170 miles of range on a LR Model 3.  If the battery is indeed in good shape, that‚Äôs impossible.  Math doesn‚Äôt lie."
"I mean this with all due disrespect:

Fuck off."
"Take a look at this to give u an idea. https://forum.abetterrouteplanner.com/blogs/entry/22-tesla-model-3-performance-vs-rwd-consumption-real-driving-data-from-233-cars/


It all depends on your location. Hot/cold or flat/hills. A few years ago i read that ~70mph is where the sweet spot is in terms of range and speed. You sacrifice a little range but you get there faster. 


Another perspective is at 75mph, i was able to make it from la to ny in 20f to 0f degrees and managed to hit all the chargers perfectly. My range was. Basically 50-60% though. This is in a 75d model x. If i were to drive 80mph+ i wouldnt have made it. Temperature and wind is a HUGE factor for range. 


A good way to be as efficient as possible is use regen as much as possible(i hear the hold feature uses more brakes than a person doing it manually). Dont have a heavy foot at every red light. A cold battery will use more power.


Tbh unless im driving long distance, i stopped worrying about efficiency.  I just charge enough to get me by and plug it back in when i think i will need more range the next day. For my weekly driving i only charge to like 60 or 70% and use it for the week until im down to 10 or 15%. Im lazy as hell to plug it in every day. I dont even bother having the range up. Only % as i have a good idea of where i can go with what %. Reason is all the other electronics in the car uses power too and it affects your range. 

Tldr: check the charts, temperature and wind matter, use regen, stop using range as an indicator and use % instead."
Same. As long as I'm not using the heat I meet or exceed the rated range.
"Have you been to the service center to check that? You might have a problem...They will do a battery check for free, and its 10 year warranty if issue. Let us know."
"> However I did try to charge up to 100% one time to let it go down to around 10% and then charge back up to 100 and only got around 170 mi.

Did you do the drive in one go or multiple? And what was the climate like?"
"I‚Äôd really prefer it if my car‚Äôs range indicator showed me actual range, not optimistic range."
"well we can see with the Taycan that EPA range is not always too high, but generally speaking nobody should care at all about EPA range all that matters is real world range.

And there you can expect a much lower range especially when doing long distance highway trips."
322
"Nah, pretty common to have in the 290s at 100% after a year or so. Just 3% degradation brings the 310 down to 300."
"This will change nothing. Teslas no longer balance/calibrate BMS like this, it's done predictively and ""live."""
"Source?

Generally, charging to 100% isnt good for longevity. I dont think you want to do that frivolously."
"No, LR AWD with 20"" wheels"
"Then you should make an SC appt with Tesla. If your driving habits are good 170mi should not be obtained even in cold weather imo. Unless you're in Alaska and parking outside and not charging and using extreme heater settings, launching the car everytime with crazy accelerations etc."
"Yeah, because that's clearly what I was talking about."
"You only drive PT cruiser, so how can you say every car?   Share your YouTube please"
"What? Then why have they been arguing with the EPA about their tester screwing up?

>He added that the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) had messed up earlier tests by leaving the car door open and the keys in the car, costing the test vehicle two percent in range.¬†"
So do I. It works out pretty similar for a 7/10s cross country run considering stopping to pee and grab a snack while charging isn't much different than stopping for gas and then parking and doing those things. Also keep in mind it's a rare ICE vehicle that would get anywhere near 500 miles of sustained highway cruising anyway.
"Air resistance is exponential. It's literally twice at 70 what it is at 55. That, plus rain (which definitely eats range), will definitely sap a lot of range. 

But, likewise, if you need to stretch out your range, trailing a semi at 55-60 will add 10-20% on the epa rated range. 

Source: my 5 year old S60 gets about 170 miles at 99% charge. Some superchargers are just about that distance apart. Those tricks can come in handy."

"Irresponsible idiot and number one sign if a bad driver. Road conditions are critical to how you should drive. Perhaps do a little digging on stopping distances in heavy rain, you might be surprised, although you're probably too stupid to even realise the importance of the information so instead you'll continue on with your mindless behaviour, needlessly endangering hundreds of other road users."
"And how heavy is heavy. Florida heavy rain isn't Montana heavy rain, etc."
60mph when you could barely see? You could kill someone or yourself one day. You never know if an accident has happened up ahead and the stop time on a water drenched road with visibility that low you would have no chance.
Responsible.
"The parasitic losses would be to big at 10 mph. 

You are the most efficient at ~20 mph."
Only if you don‚Äôt do anything to heat or cool the cabin. Drive too slowly and the other stuff drains your battery faster.
"And with over-inflated tires.

In fact, take the tires off completely and just drive on the rims. Rolling resistence will be practically nothing. Stopping distance, on the other hand..... well that's why you do it at 10MPH."
[deleted]
"I'm in Hawaii with optimal conditions year round. If i drive ""normal"" with the ac on, i get 205 Wh/mi. If i drive on chill with no ac and no passengers, i get 168-175 Wh/mi. 

Lifetime on my car is 199 Wh/mi"
"I do always keep a close watch on the cars behind me - having lost my last 100D to an idiot in a pickup who rear ended me while I was stopped at a light.  

But the closest autopilot setting feels perfectly safe to me, and while trucks are best to follow, being in almost any traffic makes a large difference in efficiency - I make a 300 mile drive regularly, so I've had lots of time to notice the various factors that affect the range.  

Generally, I see 300 wh/mile with no one in front of me when I'm going 75-79, but it will go down to 250 wh/mile or better with traffic - it seems somewhat better behind trucks, but almost any vehicle in front makes a noticeable difference. 

Rain is the real range killer, especially when the tires have to push a lot of water out of the way.  But I can even tell whether I'm going towards the coast or the mountains, and that's only a 2000' elevation difference... but I always make it back to the coast with battery to spare, but coming up to the mountains on one charge can be a challenge."
They always logged.  That was the first time they had to look at them for PR reasons.
"I think tesla showed the riadster logs in court, proved it was a lie.  They lost the suit because ""an enetertainment show can lie"".  But top gear is a big show, trusted by many people, like the entertainment news we have in the msm, so it cost tesla a lot of sales."
Do they only log cars they lend to journalists or is everyone's car logged? Kind of a security concern if they do.
"wow... https://jalopnik.com/tesla-claims-model-s-driving-logs-show-nyt-reporter-wor-192254006

I had never heard of this one. Pretty crazy they lie like this so casually cause they are used to getting away with it. Look at Teslas response it's hilarious the guy id everything he could to discharge the battery, charts and graphs to support it lol, he even charged his battery only to only 28% https://www.tesla.com/blog/most-peculiar-test-drive"
Woah... Source?
The EPA was obsessing?  Why?
it is laughable that other cars don't do such things. text and log files re so small these days.
I‚Äôd be optimistic. Government agencies are nothing if not slow.
"That‚Äôs not true the Taycan goes into 2nd gear for the majority of driving even on local streets. The issue is that if you put it into sport or sport plus it‚Äôll stay in first gear up to 55-60 to help get a better launch time. The epa doesn‚Äôt let you test the car only in normal or range mode, they make you average out all the modes so Porsche‚Äôs numbers reflect averaging the normal driving mode and the sport modes that are super inefficient.

Presumably in the real world if you were planning on taking a road trip you‚Äôd use range mode"
266 wh/mi Lifetime Average on a Model 3 Dual Motor Performance?
"Sorry, we have different vehicles so it‚Äôs not a fair comparison. [I‚Äôve posted my stats before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/byi50x/10k_miles_199whmi_lr_rwd_aero_wheels_without/)"
"Ha, fair enough. I think it wasn‚Äôt until my 4th year of LEAF ownership that I lost a bar, of course I was driving it less given the 84 mile range!!"
"I get 150 miles of daily driving ""range"" (that's EPA estimated, not real world) and 170 if I'm willing to wait a full hour (or maybe even more...) at a supercharger. In reality that translates to about 120-130 miles of real world driving. That's 21% charge loss from day of manufacture. 

90k miles so far, with some number of road trips. Though the road trips are definitely fewer now because of what a pain SC stations are."
"While I agree with you, this doesn‚Äôt improve fuel economy. Even if the car is fully charged, there‚Äôs still a lot of wasted energy.

I fixed this problem on my car by disconnecting my account from certain third party monitoring software."
"Do you have a source for this statement? If it's always plugged in, I assume you would also have to make sure it only charges up to around 80% because being constantly full or empty while sitting around is apparently bad for the battery. I would assume that being plugged in while sitting at 80% (and being deliberately stopped there) wouldn't do any good then and basically be the same as just letting it sit at 47% or whatever as no charge would happen, unless you preset a programmed departure time which would initiate preconditioning."
Why is that good for the battery
"So I'm planning to lease an SR+ 3 next year and my apartment is adding EV charging, but I'm expecting it to be something I have to reserve to use rather than a plug at my parking spot. Is that going to be a huge issue for me? I only drive about 30 miles a day on average."
"It does nothing for the battery. They put that in the manual so people don‚Äôt forget to charge their cars, get frustrated by vampire drain, or brick the battery if they let it sit for extended periods. Unless the car is actively charging, having the car plugged in does nothing to help the battery."
Repeatedly filling a lithium battery to 100% is very bad for it and depending on the charge controller design leaving it plugged in and fully charge either has almost no effect or is also very bad for it. Lithium batteries fare best at around half charge when stored for long periods (this is why your new phone will always come with about 50% charge out of the box).
"The problem is a lot of places in the US have 80 MPH speed limits and people don‚Äôt realize how nonlinear efficiency is once you go over 60 MPH.  Like it‚Äôs close to 2x more power per mile at 80 ish mph than it is at 60.

It‚Äôs the same thing for a gas car, people just don‚Äôt notice it because you only have a ridiculously inaccurate tank gage to stare at while in the Tesla you have all the data in the world."
"For another data point, I went a 350 mile trip at 75mph average and got 240 Wh/mile.

18‚Äù Aeros."
"> 224 whr per mile is around 310 miles on 70 kwhr battery or 224 miles on 50 kwhr battery. So obviously what you are claiming in terms of rang

Few people drive with the AC off, no radio, no lights etc.  That's how Tesla got to 400 miles, it wasn't an efficiency improvement they just had the EPA re-run the test with the doors closed so the interior dome lights switched off.  There's a lot of energy that doesn't get counted by Tesla's whm display."
I'm not exactly certain as to what I'm not sharing. I'm really giving you the information as to what I have in front of me.
"After just returning from a weekend 1300 mile trip in my long range RWD 3. Unless you are going downhill I don't see how anyone can get 224 @80 even with everything off.

I was getting 225 @60/65. Then 290-310 @80 mph. 70 @ 254 was my constant.

Granted I had areos off and new semi stickier tires."
Well I had the SC do a diagnostics on my battery and they said it's fine.
I just fixed my last post. I saw the confusion of what everyone was referring to. I fixed it up.
"Its unlikely there is a problem.  Having 170 mi of practical range is not uncommon depending on conditions, especially in the event of high speed driving."
I recently had them check it over Wi-Fi about a week ago.
"I think everyone agrees with that statement. Unfortunately, for testing purposes they need to do them in controlled environments. Which generally means a specific ambient temp, specific speeds, ""fuel"" capacity, etc. So those tests are generally fairly optimistic as real world driving is not like that."
"That‚Äôs not too bad. I‚Äôve also noticed one with a 510 km rating displaying 490.

Maybe it‚Äôs the tires or the average temperature where you live?"
"Yeah, it‚Äôs the wheels. Tesla advertised the Performance Model 3 with 18 inch wheels as 322 miles, but advertises the Performance variant with 20 inch wheels as 299 miles. So, it‚Äôs realistically accurate. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more in line with its true range."
"This fucking guy.....

"Apparently the EPS has tested one car, and since then Tesla just gives them their own numbers:

"> Air resistance is exponential. It's literally twice at 70 what it is at 55. That, plus rain (which definitely eats range), will definitely sap a lot of range. 

I realize, but the higher speeds are usually not *that* bad, and I absolutely refuse to drive 55 on a 70 MPH road.

> But, likewise, if you need to stretch out your range, trailing a semi at 55-60 will add 10-20% on the epa rated range. 

Not safe in normal conditions, and *definitely* not safe in heavy rain though."
Why? It‚Äôs a good speed you can maintain basically anywhere between 60-85 MPH limits without issue.
I don't think anything can be heavier than Florida's heavy rain.  It's like God just dumped a great lake down all at once.
"If the driver calls it heavy, it's too heavy for 75mph"
"You never want to slow down to unsafe levels in low visibility! That‚Äôs exactly how accidents happen‚Äî someone expects you to still be traveling at a reasonable speed, except you‚Äôre not, so they rear-end you. I wouldn‚Äôt want to take that chance."
Did they not get 1000km range last year by going 24(?)mph around a lap for a day?

"Roadster couldn't log.  S was designed to prove liars lie so it couldn't happen again.

That NYT reporter was caught lying so many times it was ridiculous.  He wrote that he lowered the temp to save power, they released logs showing it was turned up instead.  

The sad part is the lying piece of trash was promoted to some chief editor position, so the NYT is run by liars now, even if maybe it had a little credibility before that which wasn't very likely.

A bunch of East Coast S owners repeated his drive to prove him wrong again and again too, it was funny."
"Top Gear actually testified to the fact that they lied, they never denied lying.  That's why they won!  Tesla went after them for money from lost sales instead of the lies themselves, so admitting to the lies directly and openly weakened Tesla's case  immensely.  Nobody expects fiction to be true, and by testifying that Top Gear is fiction like Star Wars made expectations of factual representation unrealistic."
they log everybody's.  IIRC a german manufacturer bought a model S to test from a third party and when they turned it on they had pushed some shitty message on the screen taunting them.  I assume they have some sort of geofencing built in that let them know the car had arrived at a competitor.
The logs are local to the car.
Everyone's cars are logged so excessively that it damages the computer chips.  MCU1 chips fail because of all that logging.
Sort of questions whether you can trust them for literally anything they say to be truth doesn't it?
"https://www.tesla.com/blog/most-peculiar-test-drive

It was even more bizarre at the time.  The ""reporter"" offered a bunch of excuses when he was caught lying, and was repeatedly proven to be lying with each new excuse."
"Yep.

Mine is 288

We have same car"
"I could have saved 20k and got her a SR, because she doesn't utilize the upgrades.  Oh well. I love seeing them both in driveway"
Yeah..thats the least amount in the world. Probably set a world record. Chill mode too. Couldn't drive like that.
"I'm not talking about economy, I'm talking about battery maintenance."
Constantly being plugged in is directly from the owner's manual and may even be bolded lol. They don't recommend past 90. I myself keep it at 50 and use scheduled departure to 90
"It‚Äôs in the owners manual. Also, if you set your charge limit to 80% and leave it plugged in, it will wake up every day or so, charge back up to 80% and switch off. Right now due to the pandemic and the fact I‚Äôm barely driving I have my charge limit set to 60%. The closer to 50% you can keep your battery, the better it is for it."
It‚Äôs in the owners manual
I'm sure it is smart enough to manage the battery levels for longevity.
"Being stored at low charge or discharging past \~3.2V /cell is very bad for lithium batteries in general. As the car slowly looses charge when stationary you risk falling below the safe threshold, so having it plugged in **with a reasonable charge limit** (100% should be avoided just in general if you're not planning a really long trip) will keep it in the sweet spot indefinitely."
"You'll be OK.  Plus, you're leasing."
I drive 50 miles a day (LR not SR+) and end up plugging in at a charger that's down the street overnight twice a week. Not a big deal at all.
"It keeps it at a stable state of charge, which is good for the battery.  It's the same principle as charging more often. There's some indication that ""resting at a low SOC"" every so often can also be valuable, however.

[https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/bu\_1003a\_battery\_aging\_in\_an\_electric\_vehicle\_ev](https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/bu_1003a_battery_aging_in_an_electric_vehicle_ev)"
"This is how I look at it and it is just obvious when you think about it logically.  I get it, the manual does say to plug it in, but every time people quote the manual as a reason you should never leave it unplugged overnight, I get pretty annoyed.  Just because there are people that are new and sort of trepid with EV's, doesn't mean you should scare them into thinking they're doing harm by not leaving it plugged in all the time.  With staying home so much, it's been weeks since we plugged in the 3 and it's perfectly fine."
"Who charges to 100% all the time? I'm talking about charging to 70, 80, or 90 percent cap.  And Elon and experts have long said that you should be charging up and staying plugged in as much as possible."
Pretty sure Tesla has software to manage all of that though.
"I learned that lesson in my ICE car. Normally, I get barely over 30mpg driving on the highway 65-75mph depending on traffic. Just before the pandemic I had to do some travelling for work, where I was paid overtime for the entire duration of my trip, plus mileage. Set the cruise control to 55, relaxed, and averaged damn near 50mpg. Made out like a bandit when expenses were paid out."
MPG drops off about 40% if you drive 80 instead of 60. People do not realize this.
Yeah the fastest speed limit I encountered was 65 on the interstate and 55 on local highways.  I don‚Äôt think NY has any areas of 80mph limits.
EPA wouldn't have accepted Tesla recommendations if they do not follow the same with other manufacturers.
That interior light is consuming a lot of power.
"Yeah that‚Äôs why I said something doesn‚Äôt line up.  Either the energy usage rate is wrong or your range estimate is wrong.  Mathematically, they can‚Äôt both be right."
"Did they do a diagnostics on your right foot? I remember when the C7 Corvette came out with all that ‚Äúit‚Äôll do 30mpg‚Äù fanfare. Turns out it only did 30mpg if you barely touched the accelerator, barely touched the brake and strictly drove at 55mph."
"That's still pretty extreme - even at 284Wh/mile you should be at 246 miles of range, implying you're still at 32% battery degradation.

Maybe it's a unit of measure throwing everyone off? Just to spell it out to be sure:

You're getting 170 miles of range (not 270 miles of range), when charged at 100% and draining to 0%, using 284 watt-hours per mile, with a 70 kilowatt-hour battery. 

That's 70,000 watt-hours / 284 watt-hours per mile = 246.5 miles of range at 100% charge. You state you are actually getting 170 miles of range / 246.5 miles of calculated range = 68% of the battery, or 32% less range than you should be at your real-world highway usage.

For reference, I've done a trip using around 350 watt-hours per mile: 180 miles, 70 miles per hour, 15 mile per hour headwind, -20F Fahrenheit, using about 90% of my battery. (This was an extreme test of range - driving 90 miles away from the nearest Supercharger, parking for 2 hours without charging, then back; during one of the coldest days of the year with a pretty high wind, which both decrease range)."
And?
No shit? I didn't know they could do that -
"What frustrates me is that the car DOES have a decent range estimator built in, if you click through the energy usage screens a bit. It clearly is capable of approximating real range based on my actual average usage, speed, etc., it‚Äôs all there in the graphs. 

I just wish there was a way to display my real range on my car‚Äôs main fuel gauge, rather than the inaccurate EPA number. My guess is that they keep the EPA value up there because, like OP, it would be upsetting for most people to fill their tank and see a super low number of real world miles range listed."
"I live in the US... The weather isn't extreme... I think the hottest it's been so far was 89 degrees. In the winter, the lowest it gets it's about 20 degrees."
Thanks... I didn't know this.
"Come on, your content must be the best ever.   People need to see your retardism, I mean intellectual information.   It seems like everyone thinks your a fucking idiot.  Just share it"
"""We can confirm that EPA tested the vehicle properly, the door was closed, and we are happy to discuss any technical issues with Tesla, as we do routinely with all automakers,"" a spokesperson told the publication in May."
"The semis in my state have a speed limit of 55, so drafting one at a healthy 10 car lengths is pretty easy and not unusual at all. Nor is it unsafe, due to the number of other semis on the road also going at that speed."
"Because 80 in rain is reckless, that's why."
"Funny you should say that... Montana tried that as a law, actually. It didn't go too well - turns out that cops and rich dudes in sports cars had differing ideas of what ""reasonable and prudent"" speeds were, so they capped the state at 80. 

Winter is a little on the crazy side, but I'd still rather have snow than heavy rain."
"No you should always travel at a speed in which you can safely stop should something happen ahead of you. 60mph in rain so heavy it's difficult to see, you cannot safely stop in time. That's why people slow down to safer speeds. If there's a stationary object on the road, doesn't matter how many people are all travelling 60mph, you and everyone else travelling that speed is going to pile up."
"If you can't see, slow down and turn on your hazard lights. You are much more likely to hydroplane out of control than for someone (who is also going too fast) to hit you from behind.

Honestly this feels like trolling. It sounds too much like the arguments that people who don't wear seatbelts use."
"Rolling resistence isn't determined by smoothness of the ride. That can be a factor which affects it, but it is not the determining factor by any means. The friction of the tires has a much larger effect; that's why driving on flattened tires will dramatically reduce MPG.

Anyway, it's an intentional exaggeration, as no one in their right mind will drive on rims alone."
I appreciate the liars like him. I have profited immensely off realizing it was all complete bullshit and picking up TSLA shares at prices that should have never been available to me.
"Roadsters actually do log, just not by GSM means, but via USB stick.  Owners can even upload their logs to a Tesla site."
No one assumed the roadster had logging.  That was barely a tesla as we know it today.
"Being a lying journalist worked well for Boris Johnson. 

Shame to see bad behavior rewarded so often."
"I'd love to see a source for this. I imagine it would not be difficult, but that sounds like it would have generated rage inducing headlines."
"Except when you call for service and they start asking you to confirm mileage, battery SoC, etc. all this info is available to them in real-time."
So be it.

Thanks for that!
"I remember this - he said he circled the rest stop repeatedly because he couldn't find the charging stations.  
I live not too far from that particular rest stop so I've been to it many, many times and you can friggin see the the charging stations from the highway.  
Also anyone familiar with Tesla chargers know there's no way you can overlook a bank of them in a parking lot."

I haven't really lost any capactity after 1 year of constant 90%.  I almost never supercharge and am plugged in 100% of the time while at home."
Ah ok. I don't generally let it sit below 25% regardless. I just figured keeping it 85%/90% at all times is also not great for battery longevity.
Loses
I don't know why anyone would have thought otherwise.
"i mean they do not do it the same way for every manufacturer, thats one reason why the Taycan has  a bad EPA range while having a MUCH better real life range while its the other way around for Tesla.

Beside the full test they did with Tesla they have a simplified one where they just do a few tests and then multiple the result by 0.7 to account for the other factors.

The fact alone that they have two different ways to do it is already bad but people going nuts over good EPA ratings is even worse as what really matters is the real world and we know this already from ICE cars that their tested fuel consumption is never the same as the real world usage."
"It wasn't the interior light, it was that the door was open and the car never went to sleep as a result."
"The C7 should do 30mpg at 70-75mph. My Camaro(same engine, slightly shorter gearing, worse aero) will easily do 30mpg at 70"

"This is news to me, thank you!"
theyre very useful to the owner class
"Yea the story I heard was just that the german auto rented a used Tesla, tore it apart and then reassembled it and returned it a week later, and logs were kinda proving it."
"True, but they're stored on the car.

If the car is offline, they don't get that info."
"Actually, it is. Memory can only be written to a finite number of times. Tesla logged so much that the memory lifespan was significantly shortened."
"At first I almost believed him because that was way back before Superchargers had lighting - the V1 was just a chunky square white slab of metal.  In fact when V2 was revealed I thought tehy lights were a jab at that reporter.

I stopped giving him the benefit of the doubt when owners posted pictures and reproduced his exact drive.  He was paid to write that hitpiece by Chanos.   Chanos was caught paying people to attack his shortsale targets back then.  He still does it because the SEC didn't prosecute even when he admitted breaking the law for profit."
"Lots of times, I think they only stopped after Tesla proved them liars like 5 times in a row.  It was pathetic."
"Well, single motor helps.  I've gotten 254 wh/m on a long road trip before. But, I bought our p3ds to enjoy. Otherwise,  a prius would have been smarter."
You plug the car in and tell it to have the battery charged to 90 by the time you leave the next day. It will start charging a few hours before so it's fully charged when you are ready to leave
"Yes, I know he said 90% is fine, and I know that it‚Äôs an exponential difference between 90% and 100%, but since I‚Äôm not driving and the car is just sitting idle 6 out of 7 days of the week, I‚Äôm just keeping it at 60%. When I was commuting daily I always charged to 80% which was plenty to make the trip to and from work and still be around 50%. Right now though I just need my car to maintain enough daily charge for emergencies. I‚Äôm about a year and a half in on ownership and closing in on 30k miles. I have a roughly 5% degradation."
"No, that is fine for it. Elon has stated that 90% is fine.  
[https://insideevs.com/news/341423/teslas-new-stance-on-charging-habits-elon-responds-video/](https://insideevs.com/news/341423/teslas-new-stance-on-charging-habits-elon-responds-video/)

Im quite sure 85 is much better than 25.
"The Taycan test was literally performed by Porsche themselves, if you are claiming a fuckup, it's their own."
"We really need to revise the test so it better reflects real-world driving in the real-world car. I'd say AC and all accessories off, headlights off (daytime running lights on - if the car has them and they are on by default, they better be on during the test too), etc. The ratings for ICE cars are roughly close to realistic for the average driver nationwide (though definitely not by region - the southwest is so different from New England that it's ridiculous, but we need a number that is applicable nationwide). The EV ratings just aren't accurate in the same way. Probably because the test has more low-speed driving than most real world use cases.

Tesla collects more than enough data from it's vehicles that it absolutely could say the real-world average range of each model configuration. The vehicle knows how many miles it has driven and how much power it consumed to do it; it's just a matter of averaging those numbers. The data would need some cleaning, but not much to make it 99% accurate."
"Taycan isn't different, they just have a transmission and the test varies speeds from 0-80 with an average of like 42 mph where most of the Taycan's EPA testing is spent in the less efficient acceleration gear and most real world range driving is spent in the more efficient high gear."
"Ummm, it was during a simulated driving test, wasn't it? So the car shouldn't go to sleep when it thinks it is being driven, right?

Unless you mean certain special functions that are only active when the door is open."
"Well the model 3 advertised range is at 65mph, like most cars. So if you go 80, expect a 15-25% drop in summer, a ton more in winter or bad conditions."
"That‚Äôs what I did too, was getting tired of calculating the Tesla miles vs real miles exchange rate."
"Yeah because I waste my time uploading and making videos.   You have though, are you not proud of your work?  Show it"

"Are you aware that trains use metal wheels on metal tracks? They don't do that because they couldn't get rubber wheels to hold the weight. They do it because steel on steel has minimal rolling resistence. DONT try to sidetrack into smoothness with the metal rails and claim that's 100% of the reason it has lower rolling resistence, because if smoothness was everything they could have rubber wheels on metal tracks - and much, much better traction.

What do you think creates the rolling resistence on wheels with tires? Are you using the same definition of ""rolling resistence"" here? Because maybe you're thinking only of friction between the wheel and axle, but that's only part of it.

Let me put it this way: why do you think tires heat up as someone drives quickly in a straight line? Do you think metal would heat up if the wheel was entirely metal and had the same inner and outer diameter? (the land speed record was set on a car that used steel wheels, by the way). Where do you think that heat comes from? (Hint: internal friction in the tire, as it compresses with each rotation)."
I remember that. The owners were pissed.
"I remember that one.  The ""german automaker"" didn't even reassemble the car it was returned to its owner in pieces."
The car uploads *some* info when you plug into superchargers.  At least one stolen offline Tesla was found this way - the supercharger itself had LTE and relayed the car's location.

"I'm reaching into memory, your google skills are probably better than mine.  Start with the tesla blog above, look for news around then.  Elon was just a prone to public arguments then as he is now, it was a ridiculous time for the NYT."
You input the time manually
"Plug in, sit back in the chair and you'll see a 'schedule departure' or something similar.  Choose what days/what time and you're good to go.  It'll make sure you're charged by that time, and it can pre-heat/cool the car for your as well.

Its on a per charger basis, so it will only do it if it is plugged into that charger."
"It's a setting basically for people who leave for work at the same time daily. Of course you can set the departure time to whatever you want, so if you're going on a roadtrip, you set the time/day and it'll be charged to what you set and should do all the preheating neccessary as well."
"I am too. It may not be a huge gain in battery life between 60% and 80% or even 90%, but if I don‚Äôt have a reason to charge to 90% every day, why should I?"
"You sound so confident in your channel, just share it.  It‚Äôs going to get you more views."

"Can't blame you there. It sounds weird at first to only hold the car at 60% when 70% or 80% will be practically just as good - but when you have that ""I'm making my car better than it otherwise would be"" feeling, you go for that optimal number.

Though I would like to see some sort of study on the lifecycle of EV batteries. Tesla makes so many of them that it wouldn't be hard for them to make a testing environment that cycles charging patterns, weather, etc. Longevity under a constant state of charge would take the longest to measure, of course, because they can't accelerate time (though I wouldn't be surprised if a constant warm/hot environement actually does accelerate the chemical decay and thus can be used to run the test at 2X natural time - but that would require a pre-existing study that demonstrates that this works). 

I'm sure battery makers do such tests, but probably don't publish the results openly."

Also, since I live in the Scandinavian arctic, I care more about the range penalty imposed by the bigger non-aero wheels, than I do about the looks.

So if we're going with you cargo shorts analogy, I guess I like the pockets :)

But you should totally get the car. It's great in all aspects except for the noise!"
I‚Äôm so tempted
Nice!
What did you drive before?
Nice! I take delivery of my white on white LR on Saturday. I would have went with the performance if only they offered a 18 or even a 19 inch wheel. Ill drive about 50k mile per year so I wasn't down to replace the tires multiple times a year
Super sharp (but I‚Äôm biased)!  Congrats!
this car is very attractive. congratulations!!!üéäüçæüéàüéâ
Picking up this exact build tomorrow! Hopefully with a year of free supercharging lol
"Nice place too, what city?"
Perfect choice. üôÇ
Congrats
Congrats
Thats fire üî•üî•üî•üî• looking good
Awesome!!!   Came blacked out?
"Man I really gotta test drive one of these. I have a plain ole SR+ and already think this thing accelerates like crazy, I can't even imagine something that gets to 60 in almost half the time.

My other fear, of course, is that I'll immediately decide I can not live without performance model after that."
Can I please have it?

First car!
How do you get free Supercharging on a M3?
"Mines supposed to be Monday same build, cutting it close for the super charging."
\^\^\^\^\^
\^\^\^\^\^
Reflections. Model 3 do not have chrome delete. You can see the chrome on the mirror.
That will happen
First car because you‚Äôre young or lived in an area that didn‚Äôt require cars? Just curious
https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hdgmno/one_year_of_free_supercharging_if_order_by_today/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
"I‚Äôm 18, saved for around 2ish years."
Cheers. Very interesting
"You saved 60k in 2 years??!!
Just curious cause I'm 28 and can save 500$ max per month working everyday"
That seems like a poor financial decision at such a young age.
Congrats!
I‚Äôve gotten incredibly lucky with YouTube success so I have been making enough to afford this car. Took almost 6 years to start making money though.
I mean I probably could‚Äôve done smarter things but I‚Äôm pretty satisfied with my choices thus far.
"No one at 18 likes to hear this, but here goes. The money you made using YouTube will serve you much better if invested or saved in anything other than a depreciating asset. It‚Äôs your money and your decision, so take this as some unsolicited advice."
"Yeah you could have bought a used car and put the rest of the money into the stock market. But hey, life is short, as long as you're happy and keep yourself in check from time to time."
Ha I love that rendering üòÇ
You too? BMWs appear as road cones smh
Best shitpost I‚Äôve seen on Reddit today!
My wife walked in front of my Tesla and the screen rendered a bus. She didn‚Äôt think it was very funny.
[mfw I realized](https://i.imgur.com/zgzugNW.jpg)
BURN.
"Lol, what happens with the guy at the bottom? I haven't seen that commercial before."
Was driving next to a humongous coach. The Tesla though it was a wall and ignored the whole lane to the left.
I have my permit and I park better than this
I just see 2 teslas
"I'm wondering if the developers intentionally did this? How well do people think they can differentiate between vehicles? I mean I know it can differentiate between SUVs and cars, etc., but can it differentiate between a sedan vs a hatchback of the same model?"
because road cones have no blinkers.
We need more. It's been lacking lately
"You just got downvoted, my man."
HA! ü§£
"Now that‚Äôs a lot of damage!

(Flex Tape commercial)"
Ha!
"Technically speaking it could probably differentiate every single model of car out there, but it would take a prohibitively large amount of time and effort to train the neural net to do that. Making it able to just identify Mercedes as Mercedes would be relatively simple though, even across different models because they're all very similar in design features and you could run pattern recognition on that.

Although they certainly could intentionally make it identify Mercedes and make it show up differently on the screen, I highly doubt this was intentional and instead just an error in the way neural networks fundamentally works. Sometimes it interprets the patterns in the sensor data incorrectly.

Edit: it's also 2 separate pictures shown here, could be faked for all I know."
"This is a really solid burn, kudos"
I‚Äôm not your man guy
Funny how things work out sometimes
"Spot on. I also doubt that it was international. But you know, it would be trivial to train the neural net to recognize the tri-prong Mercedes symbol. You know, that giant decal they put up front on all their vehicles..."
Oh I can just take away my upvote if that‚Äôs what you want.
Yeah it‚Äôs kinda dumb. I tried to come off as friendly but he didn‚Äôt take it that way.
Do what you will with your imaginary internet points.
"Shit like this happen on Reddit in general, and frequently on Tesla subs specifically..."
"Calm your tits, grandpa."
"I‚Äôm not gonna bother deleting the comment, it‚Äôs just stupid. ‚ÄúOh hey this guy is at 0 votes, let‚Äôs all just downvote-bomb him because why not?‚Äù"
good one xd
"I wouldn‚Äôt delete it either.  For the little it‚Äôs worth, i upvoted all your comments"
That‚Äôs such a clean look with those wheels. It is a weird internal struggle for me. Probably my favorite look but I don‚Äôt think I could ever drive a red car. Maybe it‚Äôs an introvert thing lol
"Wow what a freaking beauty! Look at that shine!

I have the same year, same color, and model.

Any issues with paint quality?...Mine was horrendous, but it was corrected, but still :("
But did you get USB-C ports?
beautiful. congrats!
I have the same color and wheels!  Looks so good and would not be improved by chrome delete IMHO.
Anyone see the Y in the background? I Never see those in public!
"Samsung phones be like:

500% saturation mode ENGAGE"
Red is my favorite color for the model 3. It looks so stunning in all lighting. I feel like the midnight color only looks good when it‚Äôs cloudy and it can show a lot of reflections. The black looks kind of cheap in bright light. Blue just looks childish to me in all conditions. The white is my second favorite but the red is just so incredible
"This makes me really glad I got red, that looks so good. I saw a blue posted earlier and was questioning my decision on red lol"
"This red look stunning, enjoy !"
Yay!!
Nice machine you‚Äôve got there. That color is beautiful.
"Congrats 
Such a nice car"
Looks new! Very sharp look!
I'm not a fan of red cars but the Tesla red is SO NICE. I had a red Model S loaner and it was beautiful!
"I have the exact same setup.  I have never had a red car before either.  I did have a bright blue Tundra before, but all other cars were black, white, or grey (all Honda/Acura). I figured if I didn't get a red car now, I never will."
Love the color
Nice look. Getting any paint protection done?
"Awesome, congrats! I picked mine up this past Friday. Amazing vehicles!"
I take delivery of mine in 10 days. White though.
Very nice. Like the exterior color and wheel combo!
Welcome to the family!
"Right!! Teslas are so nice, drove it around the block 3 times before getting one"
Use the speed limit alarm!  It will keep you from getting a ticket. At least till you get used to the acceleration
Nice. The colors look like they pop.
Congrats! You‚Äôll absolutely love it
Congrats!!
"I want it in red as well! Dammit, I still need to save for down payment like 4 years still (after I get a job)!"
The red üòç
I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing on this. That color is poppin‚Äô!
I fucking love those wheels so much. [Hate that the standard are black on black. Good design has contrast for a reason]
Wheels look extra white for some reason. lol.
"beautiful. have you considered getting red caliper covers? They would look amazing on your car. They run about $250 and will really add another nice touch to your beautiful car.

"I hear ya. The red does pop in the sun, but it's a more subdued red than, say, a cherry Corvette."
I‚Äôm an introvert who loves my red Model 3. it‚Äôs a quiet way to express yourself.
You give one too many F‚Äôs about what people think maybe. Go with your gut. Get the red one.
"Am an introvert, but every car I've owned has been red... I just love the way they look."
"Funny.  I went to the showroom prepared to order MSM, and never considered red.  Unfortunately I went with my wife and daughters, and they unanimously voted for red.  So I have a red now.  The sales rep actually called me a couple of hours after we left and asked if I want to switch the color.  I have no regret with the red though, it‚Äôs a nice color."
"I think they also look really good on blue and MSM.  IMO, it is worth the cost to  upgrade the rims for both the 3 and Y.  The only exception is the white looks better with the Aero."
"Ya, I have red too even though I agree. I got a better price on red through sheer coincidence, but would have preferred MSM. 

MSM says: *oh, you say I look good? Gosh I hadn‚Äôt thought about it, but thanks.*

Red says: *Hey everyone, look how good I look!*"
"Never thought about that before, but I'm with you fellow introvert! Slate gray is my color. This is a fantastic look - and the best red out there - but it's just not my style."
"Love my red M3P. I get why people choose to black out the chrome, it‚Äôs just a personal preference, but I love the way it shines with the glossy red. It just really compliments the color. I would never consider blacking out the trim or the doors handles. 

Congrats and welcome to the fold! One of us!"
"The cops love the red sports car.

They like to chase em'."
"I recall hearing many moons ago that you were more likely to get pulled over for speeding in a red car. No idea if it is true though.

That said the car looks really good in red."
I just couldn‚Äôt justify it unless I bought the performance model
"I'm very introverted and my current car is red and I'm planning to get the Model 3 in red too. Best color IMO. And my favorite color is blue, so it's not that."
mood. I ended up with a red one just because of price/timing/etc. I've grown to love the look [especially when freshly washed] but I don't like the idea of being flashy [or being extra noteworthy to cops]
"How did you correct your paint defects? I picked mine up on Sunday and there were two paint defects (hazy circles under the clear coat), an inch scratch on the hood that was into the base coat, the charger port door is misaligned, there were other minor scuffs on the headlights and hood. The delivery rep said to make a service appointment but I‚Äôm not hopeful for a resolution because of all the horror stories I‚Äôve read online."
Hi. None that I could see. One of the folks went over the entire car with a cloth while I checked the finish and so on.
"I ordered this on May 25, and likely just a bit too early for the update with wireless charger and USB-C as standard. That said, I did enjoy the $2,000 price drop, so it's hard to be too salty."
Agreed ‚Äî and thank you. I'm pleased.
We find ourselves in agreement. Not going for a chrome delete here.
"Yep. The fella next to me took delivery of a Model Y, Midnight Silver Metallic, with the 20-inch Induction wheels looked pretty tough. He let me check out the interior. It has a ton of space."
Exactly my thoughts!
My service center has them to test drive.
iPhone 8+. ;-)
Solid. No regrets here! :-)
"Indeed, it is. :-)"
"My last car was black, and the one before it was a 1992 Ford Taurus station wagon in a color called mocha frost. Not awesome. Ha."
"Not sure, really. I'll drive it a spell and think about it."
Thanks!
Might need that AND setting acceleration on Chill. Haha. It definitely takes off.
I thank you.
"It's the light, but yes haha."
Curious to how long these will look good for.
Thank you.
"Mine is a 2018 LR RWD in red and i absolutely love it.   

THAT SAID - 

Invest in some Optimum no rinse. When the car gets dirty, the red loses its pop very quickly."
Forget paying extra for the paint. Buy a white one and wrap it. Satin red for the win!
"Same, which is why I picked the midnight silver. Hides me and the dirt."
"My MY is my fifth red car! We looked at our street yesterday ... a sea of gray, white and black."
"First car (hand-down, thanks dad) was blue, second, which I bought, was red. It‚Äôs just a beautiful color for a car"
I‚Äôm very torn about getting a white M3 with upgraded wheels and then powdercoating them dark grey or matte black. Or just stick with the Aeros. Thoughts?
noob here. What does MSM stand for?
Mine is currently in to fix a minor paint issue on the truck I had at delivery.  I went to the app and scheduled an appointment.  Pretty easy.  They gave me a 2016 Model S as a loaner until mine is ready.  Dropped it off on June 11 and due back June 18.
"I got mine back in Dec before Covid, so the SC addressed them right away. They had to respray the trunk and 2 right side doors. That's how bad the paint defects were.

Then I took it to a detail shop to do a paint correction to remove the light scratches and swirl marks."
Wow I thought the quality stuff was just with the Y's looks like Elan has zero F's to give at the end of Q2...
"Tell me about the charger port misalignment. I got mine on Sunday, and I initially thought the charger port should be more flush, but looked at every other model 3 on the lot, and they all are the same -- slightly not flush with the tail light.

Do you mean something different?"
"Can you take a photo of the front corner of the car?...either facing the left or right corner of the front from afar?

I like to see the paint match between the fender and bumper.

Thanks!"
"Yeah for 2k I'd but a few USB to C cables and be happy too!  Nice car, see you on the road!"
"Ahhh i see, well looks incredible regardless. Congrats!"
"I think there is a after market wireless port for about $125...I just ordered mine, I know I will have the pads, but the paint is what really worries me..."
"FWIW, I ordered mine on June 2 and delivered on June 14, and I got USB-A. The delivery guy said he had not seen any Model 3s with USB-C yet. I'm on the East Coast. USB-C seems to be reported in CA so far only."
Ordered mine on the May 25th as well and picked up on Sunday. Got the price drop but not the USB-C... Still a great car!
"Damn, that red is hella sexy then. Why does it have to be sooooo expensive"
"It‚Äôs very easy to speed in an electric car, even without the crazy acceleration. With no audible feedback from the engine, it‚Äôs easy to break the speed limit without trying."
Thanks for the tip!
"yeah, would do this in retrospect. well, if white was the standard color when I ordered, I would just have a white car."
"Just remember that wherever the wrap chips (when a small rock hits it on the road, etc) the color underneath will show. I thought of doing this too when I got mine, but ended up with a matte grey on a MSM. Wrapped it in December, and I already have two small chips, that thankfully are very hard to see, because the color underneath is basically the same. I would imagine white under red will show, a lot..."
"Don't forget wraps don't last forever.  If you plan to keep the car a while you're going to need to rewrap every 2-3 years.   Maybe more or less depending on the quality of the wrap, how much you drive, climate, etc."
If you do this is there a way to update the visualization of your car to be red?
"I would definitely upgrade and powdercoat, the 19‚Äù are good on their own but a dark grey would look so much better, I‚Äôve always personally thought the Aeros were the worst wheels I‚Äôve seen on any car but that‚Äôs just me."
"Glossy powder coat

I like the Aeros on white. They look good with or without the covers. Saves you $1500
Midnight Silver Metallic! It's the official name of the grey paint.
"Dark Grey.

‚ÄúMidnight silver metallic‚Äù"
[deleted]
Thanks for posting your experience. Were the scratches and swirl marks due to them washing the car before giving it back to you? If it is I wonder if I can request them not to wash it to avoid that.
ElOn!
"https://imgur.com/a/LSefWGx

Does the above link work? The delivery specialist tried to convince me that since it‚Äôs a moving part of the car, that‚Äôs how it is and nothing can be done about it unless I wanted to cancel the whole delivery and put in a new order but I pushed back and she noted it on my account so I could make a service appointment when my Tesla account on the app went live. I looked around at the other M3s in the lot and their charge port cover was flush."
Hope this helps. https://imgur.com/a/fBDhCSE
Yeah got mine on the 11th. Has USB-C and wireless but was picked up in Fremont.
I ordered mine in March and got the car on June 13 with wireless charger and USB C here in Canada
"I think that's why. I never really had a lot of interest in red until I saw this in person. I kept seeing the Midnight Silver Metallic with the 19-inch sport wheels and thought it looked tough as hell. It's what I was gonna order, until I saw the red sitting on the sport wheels."
So true. I find that I'm already at the speed limit by the time my peripheral picks up the numbers of the display. I have some control techniques that I'm carrying over from 14 years of driving a Prius to avoid really gunning it.
No charge to me.  Covered under warranty.
"Yes, I made that mistake of not telling them that!

Do not allow them to wash them. Remember they're in a rush to get your car in and out, and don't care about using fresh microfiber towels when it gets dirty."
"Here‚Äôs mine left and right sides. Every model 3 I saw had a similar ‚Äúit looks 1 mm off‚Äù look to it. https://imgur.com/a/870IPz9/

Edit - mine looks slightly more flush than yours? But if they fix yours to make it totally flush with the side, let me know because if I‚Äôm ever in for service I‚Äôll mention it too. Otherwise, I‚Äôm fine with how it is.

Edit 2 - some searching here, found this: https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/cmuhyl/charge_port_alignment/"
"God, I'm having an eyegasm just looking at that beauty!"
Yea I‚Äôll let you know. My SC appointment is on 6/22
Thanks!
"The SC was able to fix it yesterday. Looks more aligned than it did at delivery. 

https://imgur.com/a/mvAvbrM

Opened and closed it a few times and so far so good."
"Thank you for following up! That does look better. I have a 6/30 appointment and may ask about mine. I think mine might already be close enough. But I have a couple other issues I want them to check on 6/30 - (1) driver's side lumbar support button seems to work inconsistently (I found a few similar issues searching on this sub), and (2) annoying slight rattle at speed from left A pillar or side view mirror area. It's really quiet but still, sounds like an aluminum can quietly pinging or rain on a tin roof or something.

No panel or paint or rain intrusion issues for me. And the rattle is so minor I'm not concerned. I do want the lumbar support button fixed. Overall, I'm incredibly happy with the car. I cannot imagine a better commuter car, although there isn't much commuting going on ATM."
Wow that‚Äôs impressive and proactive of Tesla. Good on them!
"Ideally, this would  be powered by the same logic as Storm Watch, instead of a one-off manual alert."
I thought supercharges had backup reserve power?
Impressive yet no built in weather app to see even a 5 day forecast :-(.
Are you a native of Louisiana?  Wouldnt mind asking u some questions about buying/owning a TM3 here.

That is honestly amazing. I freakin love tesla. The most down to earth car company.
"Got it too, not to worried about this one  (Christobal) though."
"Hah, I charged my car Saturday afternoon and didn't get the message until Monday morning, after the storm had already passed.... Better late than never?"
Nah.  It‚Äôs just bringing a few inches of rain
"I‚Äôm looking into both of those, as well. $20,000 is a lot"
Maybe a Tesla type store that they could keep control over the code and ensure that nobody is going to do something malicious in those web apps... personally I would be very very hesitant to install anything into the thing that drives and controls my life while I‚Äôm moving in it. I would imagine it would be pretty easy for audible or others to build out apps that would enhance the things that we do.
"It‚Äôs puts the seat back and the steering wheel up, to allow you an easier entry"
Not all of them do.
Not many yet. That has been the long term idea for a while but batteries are still in (relatively) short supply. They are prioritizing cars over power packs for the most part.
But we do have a web browser in the car... just save it as a favorite.
I am not a native. I moved down here from Alaska to take a federal job

I'm native as well if the other guy is unable to help you.
It‚Äôs just the program that push your seat forward and up when ya get out and in.
"It's a profile you create (seat and wheel position) that the car sets when you unbuckle your seatbelt to help you get in and out of the car. I have mine push the steering wheel way up and back and the seat down and back. When I put the car in drive, my normal profile kicks in, the wheel lowers and the seat goes to my cruising position. It feels like I'm being loaded into a space ship every time!"
Idk if many storms have clear sunny skies
"So they do until they don't, is that correct?"
Yea just not that same. Be nice to click the temp and it fly out the 5 day.
Sent you a DM
"Are you in BR area, by chance?"
"I think he‚Äôs saying that since he‚Äôs has the power wall and sunny skies right now, he should be good for a couple of days without power during & after the storm, even if he needs to charge the car."
yes
I think they don't until they do would be more appropriate.
Most do but I think some done
"Agree, but it is an option that no other car actually has :-) that said most of those cars with CarPlay have a five day forecast building so it‚Äôs a six of 1/2 dozen of another ;0)"
Yes
most don't though.
Would be really cool if Tesla opened up so developers could make apps for the car. Even just web apps would be cool
My 2018 BMW 4 series shows a 3 day forecast anytime I wanted to see it.
Awesome!  Sent you a message.
"Tell your associate to put the video on YouTube and blast it to all the news in the local area. Most importantly tell them to file police report investigation. 

That‚Äôs what I did and caught the asshole who did it to me. I hope your associate has the full video and captured the plates."
[deleted]
Because anyone driving a BMW overpaid for an underperforming car when it's compared against any Tesla.
Sure the dude shit himself when he saw the message he was being recorded.
And once he‚Äôs caught post it on r/TeslaJustice
Get the plate?

What a dick. What motivates these assholes?
The thing is that Tesla owners can‚Äôt key another car since we don‚Äôt have a key ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Wow what a fucking asshole.. I hate to stereotype, but this fuckface is not helping BMW drivers' case. Coming from a former BMW turned Tesla owner.. Hope the video captured the plate"
I'm super excited to read the followup about this guy being ID'd and brought to justice. Those are always delicious.

Just curious how often is sentry mode on? Is it automatic?
Okay these have got to be fake and marketing campaign for Tesla Sentry Mode. Why do people hate Tesla so much enough to vandalize?
I would bet a paycheck its politically motivated.
Damn I have some annoying scratches on my car and I can't find any associated sentry video for them. I thought there's no way they could be keys but seeing the little amount of time this guy did it I'm second guessing...
Is this in Tahoe?
Because they‚Äôre driving a bmw suv
Caught! Good evidence. Always keep sentry mode on.
"As an ex bmw owner, I got keyed a few times. Our tesla so far has not been hit yet. There are a million teslas in Miami so.."

"Proud model 3 owner now and came from a BMW. Bought it pre-owned and got a great deal including .9% financing. Enjoyed that car a lot, though my Tesla is better in every possible way. Would NEVER do something like this asshat did. Oh and I used my turn signals too. ;)"
Or maybe this guys just an asshole and who cares what he drives.
Actually no. i3 CPO owner here and paid $15k for it. Well worth it.

"lol, it‚Äôs like he almost fainted! Quick bp drop when he realized that got caught"
What i dont get is who tf doesnt know Teslas record at this point...?
"Would be great if we could have a sentry mode display somehow outside the car.  Considering how often cars get keyed, it would probably be a popular option.  Something like a passive transmissive LCD film under the window (not dot matrix, but just fixed messages in black like they use in old calculators and appliance displays)."
"It's always been a thing, but until Teslas got side cameras this footage was never available. Regular dash cam only gets front and maybe rear."
"Yeah like the other commenter said, it's ALWAYS been a thing but keying someone's car is too easy to get away with until NOW. Fuck these people"
"Give the BMW stuff a break. BMW makes awesome cars and there are asshats everywhere.

I don't get people who do this. This looks like someone too old to act so juvenile. As Vincent Vega said, ""What's more chickenshit than f---ing with a man's automobile? I mean, don't f--- with another man's vehicle."""

"It is on automatically when u park, unless u set it to not be on for specific places like ‚Äúhome‚Äù, ‚Äúwork‚Äù, or ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù.

"Sounds like the guy was caught. I'm sure at that point the insurance company goes after them for the full cost of repairs? Also, depending on the state, the person gets charged ranging from misdemeanor to felony."
Exactly what a bmw owner would say. Tsk....
"Me too, went from a M135ix to a Model 3 Performance. I liked the BMW's low seating position and the sportier seats in general. But that's about it, the Model 3 is just so much more fun."
"But you aren't stuck driving your BMW. I think some of these guys are stuck in financing their BMW and couldn't even think about getting a Tesla, even though it's not more expensive."
"Of all the things you could‚Äôve complained about Tesla you picked *regular OTA updates*, one of the best and most valuable features of a Tesla."
"Yeah that lean back was the oh shit moment, you could feel his body tense up"
Almost anyone who doesn‚Äôt own one or have a friend that does?
People stupid enough to key cars.
"Some Teslas have an outside speaker for fake extra noise for ""safety"". Perhaps that can do double duty announcing ""Sentry mode activated. You are being recorded."" Does not need to be loud, just clearly intelligible near the car."
That would be super cool! I went the low tech route and put sentry mode notice decals on my small rear windows.
"""No trial, no jury, straight to execution"""
"Yeah I prob should have added an /s.

I looked at the 3 series and Audi A4 before deciding I wanted to go electric. Wasn‚Äôt as nearly as impressed with the Audi as I was the BMW. Came close to buying a used BMW before deciding to wait for a Model 3. Even briefly looked at the i3 but couldn‚Äôt deal with it being such a weirdsmobile."
Wow that‚Äôs awesome!
Where do you live?
Tnks
I knew it looked familiar.  I‚Äôm in the area.
Ah you mean other camera angles. Yeah didn't think about that. I'm just a lurker not an owner so didn't think about the multiple cameras
What did they drive?
Wow that's great to hear. These people really need to stop the hate
Haha. You got me! I only used my turn signals SOME of the time.
9% is terrible
"Yes. I suppose that is a good point. Still doesn‚Äôt even begin to excuse this childish behavior, but maybe provides a little background."
[deleted]
"Yeah, traditional alarms do warn upon approach, but a nice MP3 could be both more effective, and less annoying to bystanders.  Maybe we can get a Peter Weller robocop voice, I'd buy that for a dollar."
"Yeah I have a lot of sentry stickers on my car, but my wife finds them too garish for her so I wanted something that disappears when driving. I looked into electronically frosting glass films but they don't work when cut into complex shapes."
"You made the right choice. BMW are great cars, but our Teslas are awesome."
My last Tesla had hundreds of scratches all over it. My new one thankfully hasn't had any yet. Hopefully it stays that way
I too drive a virtual Tesla.
It wasn‚Äôt a car. If you go back to my posts you‚Äôll see the video. He walked off to the streets.
I think you're missing the point.
"They said .9%, which is a fantastic rate."
"Considering your on this forum you must be interested and excited by a Tesla, and have looked in them, therefore know about it.  But for 99% of the population my comments stands. 

You are the exception good sir, not the ruleZ 

And yes, I was generalizing, which giving the subject matter I thought was ok."
"Personally I‚Äôm thinking ED-209.

‚ÄúI am now authorized to record your presence.‚Äù"
Indeed they are.
Cause?
Ahhh I remember that guy. Glad you were able to catch him.
"They also missed the number, the main commenter said they got .9% which is a fantastic rate."
"I'm afraid we'll soon have a Tesla app store where will be spending $5 a pop for all these sentry clips, fake engines noises, and wallpaper for pet mode."
"Assholes scratching it in parkinglot. Primarily the gym I went too. Early sentry mode days so it failed to catch them, or maybe it didn't. I still have the hundreds of hours of footage to go through to see if it caught anything. But it was like dicks were walking all around it giving it light to heavy scratches wherever they could. Those fucjs didn't know i had a clear brah so I could always see where they tried to scratch the hood and ended up tearing the clear brah"
"I can't tell if ur being punny or actually missed the ""point"" too üòÇüòÇ"
So they intentionally did it? Where do you live?
Little city next to Compton. Literally the only tesla in the area
Ah so Norwalk.
Near there too lol
"This is cool, help me understand exactly what‚Äôs happening. You‚Äôre going steady speed on AP when a car comes up behind and AP speeds up to avoid being rear ended? Did you receive any alert beforehand? When did you accelerate? After AP had already sped up? Did you notice the car before or after AP averted the accident?"
That rear camera is such an amazing tool to have on as much as possible. Helps with total surveillance and in many cases can save your model 3's @$$. Super glad you got outta there unscathed!
Wait.. wow.. did you accelerate or was that AP..
"Kinda badass how it escaped it, like the batmobile"
"I guess you don't know for sure, but why did he almost rear end you?

Was he not paying attention, racing, on his cell phone?"
And this folks is a perfect example of why not to drive in Chill mode
Where was this by? So many people driving so fast I can only imagine there was a car meet or something. And we had one where I live last night.
"Ahhh, the infinite rubber-band of smoothness."
Kudos to your exceptional situational awareness!
I have a hard time justifying my purchase of the performance model until I see things like this. This is why instant torque is important.
defensive driving at work.  good save.
"Haha, damn you were gone quick!"
"as my good buddy would always say... ""when in doubt.. power out!"""
"So glad you were aware and are safe! Just finished reading through all of the comments.  Regardless of the ""possibilities"", have the awareness you did and the instant linear acceleration of the Tesla totally got you our of that situation and keeps you feeling confident about being safe.  Big wins all around!"
fast as fuk boi
"Your title is misleading - it states the car outran the hit, but it did not.  Your driver input is what outran the hit."
you're in the middle lane and going slower then everyone else.
"What doesn't make sense is if you had room to outrun the accident,  why were you braking?"
"Seem like you brake check the guy behind and you accelerated.

I might be wrong.  But by looking at car on the right lane, it seem to speed up almost parallel as the guy directly behind you."
"I was on AP, I constantly check around me because I don't let AP drive 100%. Look in the rear view mirror and I see this guy barreling down my ass.

AP didn't warn me or sped up, that was just my intuition and judgement to get out of the way."
"Do you usually drive with the rear camera open all the time? I don‚Äôt, but after seeing this I just might on highways. Do you use it all the time? Or just highways?"
"Exactly my questions! Was really hoping Autopilot did the evasive maneuver, but not ‚òπ"
Just say ass
"i have to remember to clean out the rear camera on my long trips.. 

Thanks!"
"That‚Äôs true, but I get headaches from staring at it for too long"
"that was me, I wish AP accelerated.."
The OP said he accelerated.
That was completely badass. Way to go. Unbelievable.
"You have just as much information as I do based on the video. My assumption is that he miscalculated his speed and how effectively his 2005 Red Toyota Corrola can stop or shift lanes. 

All of his windows were tinted, so when I drove next to him to see what he was doing, I couldn't tell. I could see the feint light of his cell phone inside his car, but again I can't assume that he was using his phone. 

I hate front dark tints in cars just for this reason."
"just happened to be where 4 cars came out of nowhere, the freeway was fairly open otherwise. Barely had to have AP change lanes or anything. I just sat there for over 100 miles arguing with the car about its AP decisions, and checking all fours more than if I was driving myself."
"Yeah, but the cars huge torque is what made it possible. The AP didn't outrun the hit, but the torque did."
Based on this 16 second video I can not refute your obvious observation.
"I wasn't, i was on autopilot until I hit the accelerator. Autopilot was doing the driving until I took over."
"if there was any braking it was autopilot, I had no reason to brake check anyone.

When driving long periods of time, I put it on AP, and am constantly arguing with the car wondering why it wants to change lanes, or like a dad teaching their kid how to drive, I look before the car changes lanes etc."
Autopilot** brake check
"Oh gotcha, well done you. I don‚Äôt trust it either but like a chicken I become easily hypnotized by the road so I don‚Äôt know that I would have caught this guy coming up like that. And wtf is up with that anyway. I wonder if AP would have sped up if you had not. The world will never know!"
"That‚Äôs nuts. Very nice defensive driving there.

Reminds me of an incident many years ago. A nice mid-morning day, some guy in a van was driving erratically on a highway behind me some car lengths back. For seemingly no reason at all he starts hauling ass and I‚Äôm watching with increasing alarm as he‚Äôs coming up on me. I think he‚Äôs just going to whip into the passing lane but he doesn‚Äôt and I brace for impact. Then suddenly he jams on the brakes and makes a hard turn. I‚Äôm watching in my rear view mirror as the van is tumbling down the highway sideways. Me and the passengers in the car were dumbstruck. I should have stopped but I didn‚Äôt, I was just a dumb kid back then. It was a moderately busy highway and the wreckage obviously stopped all traffic. I never did find out what happened to the occupants of that van."
"Yeah, a rear end is the only thing AP can‚Äôt do something for, at least from my experience"
You are better than AP !üëç
"Honestly, I don't think they would have hit you. Looking at the 10s frames, they were already decelerating and moving slower than the car to your right (left in video) before you went rocket ship at 11s.

I think they were intentionally trying to scare you out of the way. Rode into you hard and straddled the lane to give themselves an option to go either way...

... and then were shocked by the instant gap you opened."
This looks like dashcam footage recorded after the fact
"I do not watch the rear camera, I'm constantly checking all my mirrors as a habit of being a hobbyist track racer.

I keep it up when on the freeway because I find driving on the streets and freeways are far more dangerous than the track."
Ass
https://youtu.be/pn1VGytzXus?t=1
"lol give me a break, most cars would have been able to ""outrun"" a potential rear end.  Even a Honda civic.  Remember, the other driver is also hitting his brakes to avoid the collision too, which makes even nominal forward acceleration in a car increase gap between the two cars.

we're not talking about 0-60 times here...torque is hardly a factor...it's more about how quick driver was to mash the pedal forward.

(btw... I own a Tesla Model 3 Dual Motor...  I'm aware of the torque.)"
I think the lighting makes it look like your brake lights are on
"i think all collision sensors are placed in the front. And the rear sensor is up to 2 feet, so at the delta of speed between the rear car and I, there wouldn't be much warning. I wish the cameras would have telemetry data embedded on the video so speed, braking, turning, etc could also be displayed."
">You are better than AP !üëç

AP and driver, better together."
"looking further into the video, it seems that he was trying to either outrun the car to  the video's left or right... that dude was going to hit me braking or not.. at the speed delta between him and I, even if he were to slam the brakes to scare me, he'd slide.. ABS wasn't standard on those model year Corollas"
"I caught that! I was just wondering because OP knew to speed up at the perfect time, could have looked in the rear view at the right time but rear camera being open made more sense to me."
Ass
Exactly the community feel I'm needing right now hahaha
"Any automatic transmission vehicle would have to changed gears to meet the demand of the drivers input. I don‚Äôt quite understand how you think a civic would have out run a car driving into me with such a speed delta. 

Braking or not; that guy was about to kiss my ass hard."
"

There are cars that simply do what you want then to, and cars that don't. My civic hesitated, my Tesla doesn't.
Either way, tough to tell from a 16 second video at night. The other cars which were passing the Tesla and likely didn't brake were quickly left behind though."
"there are a lot of spots that I wish i had cleaned on the camera, I understand why people are getting an impression that I had braked. 

One thing was clear, I was going to get hit regardless unless I accelerated."
Ultrasonic sensors are \~8 feet of range and cover 360 degrees.
Ah right - he posted somewhere else that he pays a lot of attention even when AP is on. Seems it really paid off here :)
Ass
"Good to know.. my rear sensor statement was based on when the car dings at me when approaching an object.   


lol, imagine if the car was bitching at you for objects 8 feet away when going in reverse."
"imo, having AP on means you can pay MORE attention to things like this! I use AP for more relaxed and focused executive decision-making."
Ass ass ass ass
Definitely!
Fucking vulgar
Looks awesome! Very unique looking. Can we see the inside?
Just attached a wallbox inside an old propane gas bottle.
Fill it up with unleaded electricity please...
Looks explosive...

Very nice! I love what you did with it
Nice!
I dig it
Show Elon this.
Nice!
"Nice

Is this the final placement? Are you planning to bury the cakes under for a super clean look?"
Why is it a model 3 gas station and not a tesla gas station.
"This is really great looking. The red is not Tesla red, but still looks good."
"Friendly Warning: You can not paint propane tanks dark colors (I.e. black). It will absorb too much heat, cause the gas to expand dramatically and explode. There is a reason every propane tank you‚Äôve ever seen is a light color and usually just white."
Looks like a lot of time went into and I‚Äôm having a hard time seeing the worth of effort.
Sure.
I'd have guessed you made your own Tesla themed smoker lol.  Looks cool!
Haha I thought you were feeding like a generator with a propane tank and converting to electricity hahah
"Bamboozled

Don't know yet. Freshly done. Wait for the plants to grow back and then maybe bury it.
"No reason. I have a model 3. That's all. Of course you can use it for any Tesla, because it's a standard Tesla Wallbox inside."
"But you understand that there's no gas inside ? It's just an old bottle where I put a door in and fixed a Tesla wallbox inside. I posted another picture showing the inside also. So no explosion expected. And I live in northern Germany. So, not too much heat expected ...."
"Just looking cool. Thats effort enough ... i let a guy do it. 320 ‚Ç¨. Wallbox is dry, got a fixed loading station. So: all good."
"Saw the other post -- looks cool! Smaller than I expected from this post somehow. I'd imagine it might be nice to have a little room for some cleaning supplies in there, but probably best not to have a beastly installation taking up space outside."

I did and really like it.  Just a small thing to make it a little more unique.
I also did mine and I really like the result.  It's not too hard to do as long as you have a heat gun or hair dryer (heat gun works better). Some people don't like it because they think the T logo looks cleaner.  I like it because it reminds me more of a Lotus or the Roadster.
"Looks like the Vorsteiner Volta kit.  I could be wrong but the wheels are Vorsteiner as well.  Be prepared though, that whole set up is not cheap.

Uffff didn't know they had full kits for Tesla. Thank you for the link. Beautiful setup nonetheless

Well it‚Äôs not easy to get the dual motor badge just perfectly crooked like the factory does
"Yea. You buy a Tesla bc you don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúsup it up‚Äù. When you‚Äôre paying for that nice of a car, leave it stock or buy the upgraded packages that come with it, not this aftermarket sht. Just my opinion tho. Not my car, and as you said, to each his own."
Exactly. Can‚Äôt imagine why I was downvoted for expressing what *i* want. Some people are such snowflakes. This kit is gorgeous.
why?
I got the chrome version from [here](https://www.abstractocean.com/perf-emblem/).

Looks like they have a model s in the garage as well
It's interesting to read the comments on the NFL thread. Seems like folks have no idea what Teslas are and are not capable of
I‚Äôm going to buy one for my dad and this brought a tear to my eye
Amazing üòä
Imagine handing over the key but not realizing it‚Äôs a card/phone haha
Cute
Super wholesome
can't really do the ceremonial key toss
Anyone else notice the other Tesla in the garage....? this feels like click bait.
"And then we have a couple of supposed owners claiming that Autopilot is truly full self driving.

It's knuckleheads like that that get us in trouble. Don't get me wrong, I consider my Autopilot + FSD package to be life-altering as far as driving is concerned. But if you use it incorrectly, it can also be life-ending."
"You can flip him the Tesla key card.  Doesn‚Äôt quite carry the same weight, though."
"Comments in the original post say that his dad is the kind to spoil his wife, and not do anything for himself."
"Yes, but is that his dad‚Äôs home?"
"100% chance Autopilot/FSD is  life-altering. most good, some bad :D"
"Although to-date I know of only very few occasions of death from incorrect use. It‚Äôs more of an assumption than proven fact, because hardly anyone leaves autopilot unattended/ not ready to take over."
Pictures like this make me reconsider getting a black Model 3 instead of a white one. (I live in Houston where we have 3 digit temps in the summer)
She‚Äôs a beaut!
"Have your ever noticed that dark colored Model 3s have a taller looking front because the darkness of the paint hides the radiator grill at the bottom? Colors like white expose that grill, breaking up the tallness of the front. Just an observation."

"Black like mine, love it"
"it looks a little underexposed to me. I like that the picture is pretty clean but the bushes bother me. They do not add anything to the picture but are slightly distracting. I'd rather see the car offset against the clean lines of the building. also consider putting the car a little mor off the center axis horizontally. Dynamic objects like cars mostly benefit - I think - from more negative space in front of them/in driving direction. I would also get the car slightly more towards a third line vertically, i.e. either crop a little off the top (would't nurt the pic too much, I think) or including more foregound (could be boring unsless there's something interesting there). Other than than, nice pic..."
Except every mode 3 picture is special.
I agree with the OP.

SO true!
"I prefer white over black, but it's not exactly always clean either... I'm sure silver would be the best one, right? Of course that isnt't available anymore..."
"Facts. Black is pretty hard keep clean but tbh I‚Äôve only washed it once since I took delivery back in feb. I know, shame on me üò¨"
By a lot you mean you have to wash it 15 min after you finish drying it right? My secret is a satin black wrap and a layer of ceramic coating. That way it only needs to be washed every 30 minutes! I doubled the time between washes
"While true, it‚Äôs often overblown. Outside of pollen season once a month washes is sufficient."
"Haha, I like that it breaks it up on the white one. We both win!"
...you're better than that.

I appreciates that's abouts yous.
Never ever in any circumstance fully trust autopilot. Always be vigilant (as Tesla suggests) because it has its quirks.
Just get ready for lots of not particularly necessary trips out to...anywhere.
"Learn how to set up Sentry Mode and do it, like now. It‚Äôs so much easier with the latest software update than it used to be earlier. The effort /cost  vs reward tradeoff is heavily in your favor."
Obsessive parking away from others
"1) You don‚Äôt have to push the stalk all the way down to engage AP or all the way up to disengage; just a tap (or two) will do. 

2) Under 5mph you can switch from reverse to drive or vica versa without stopping or putting you foot on the brake. Just tap up or down on the stalk - again, just a tap will do, you don‚Äôt have to push it all the way. Super useful for parking.

3) The Park button will immediately stop the car at speeds less than 5mph. This can lead to some surprises if you‚Äôre used to a car that has windshield wiper controls where the Tesla park button is. 

4) You can open the charge port by pressing on it or pressing the button on the charge nozzle. 

5) These wireless phone chargers are great: [LINK](https://www.amazon.com/TapTes-Horizontally-Vertically-Smartphone-Compatible/dp/B07X2RJ2V4) 

6) Consider wrapping the center console: [LINK](https://evwraps.com/products/tesla-model-3-center-console-protective-wraps?variant=15132034695226&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&utm_campaign=gs-2018-08-28&utm_source=google&utm_medium=smart_campaign)

"If you can afford it and don't live 5 minutes away from a supercharger, invest in a home charger. It is *liberating* and saves you hours to do things that you enjoy. However, I do miss eating and watching netflix while charging the car."
"Always think before you park, I try to park around empty areas with other teslas and more expensive cars to avoid vandalism and doordings. Also don't stress the battery mumbo jumbo. Charge to 90% on usual days, but don't be afraid to charge higher or drain super low."
"I've posted this before, but I think most of these tips haven't been mentioned here yet:

The fastest way to start navigation is to swipe the Navigate box instead of tapping it. It will automatically start navigation to home or work. You can also swipe the temperature display instead of tapping the arrows.

The dashed line under the gear shift indicator indicates that regenerative braking strength is reduced due to the battery being too cold or too full. When the dashed part of the line is long, the car won't slow down when you release the accelerator and you'll have to use the brakes a lot more. The line will turn from dashed to solid as the battery warms up.

Thieves can access the trunk after smashing a window because the rear seats can be folded down from the cabin. If you want to prevent things in your trunk from being stolen in a smash and grab then get [these](https://www.etsy.com/listing/680117217/one-pair-of-tesla-model-3-rear-seat-lock), they work well.

Don't login to the YouTube app. If you do, then anyone who gets into the car can read your Gmail in the browser.

If it won't release the charging cable, open a door first. If that doesn't work there is a manual release inside the trunk way on the upper left in a little hole, where the charge port is on the outside. It's a little rubber thing attached to a short cable that you can pull.

If you use non-smart Summon regularly, you need to buy a key fob. It's way faster and more reliable to use non-smart Summon with the key fob than the phone app.

If something is wrong with the touchscreen, hold down both scrollwheels for several seconds to reboot it. You can do this while driving without a problem; the only driving thing that is affected is the blinker sound (but the blinkers still work)."

"\-As I'm sure you know, EV batteries like to be around 50% for optimal battery longevity and lower degradation.  To help with this, I use Scheduled Charging to charge my car at about 5am.  This leaves my battery at a lower state of charge for a longer period of time (and also the hotter period of the day in the afternoon) after I've used it all day and am at home for the evening.

During the pandemic and while I'm working from home, I only charge it to 60% daily as I have no need for any more.

\-If you haven't already, get a 240V line for charging at home.  Charging on a 120V line takes forever and almost any Amperage 240V line is better. I'm on a 30A 240V and it's more than enough.

\-If you can't get Spotify on the car to play, tap on the Slacker icon and wait for it to load, then go back to Spotify.  Works nearly every time.  Same if TuneIn isn't working.

\-Be sure to cash in on any incentives you can, including the current federal incentive for installing a home charger (including the cost of running the power to the charger). I think it's good through 2020."
"When you return to your car and it‚Äôs on a free 14-50 NEMA charger at a grocery store, etc..:

The charger itself doesn‚Äôt unlock first.  Open the trunk or door and let the charger light change from blue to white. Now the charger is unlocked and you can easily remove the adapter."
"1. Keep tires at 45 psi; if they go below 43, your mileage will be significantly affected. Dropping your tire pressure below 35 will significantly improve your 0-60 mph times at significant cost of battery life. Not 100% verified due to Pandemic shutting down further tests, but 0-60 tests have yielded sub 3 second 0-60 times; Runs in 2.93 and 3.01 seconds.. Testing with 10Hz GPS sensors; will finalize confirmations when COVID is over.
2. Do not trust autopilot 100%, it's nice to get rid of the microtransactions to keep the car between the lanes and constantly monitoring distance. Keep vigilant and always check your surrounding, confirm that there is indeed no car when autopilot wants to change lanes.
3.  Keep battery charge below 70% if your drive is extremely short day to day. Battery life is significantly improved when keep State of Charge between 20 and 70%. Definitely do not charge to 100% unless you're planning to drive immediately afterwards.
4. Get a home charger if possible. I've installed both the Tesla Charger V2, and a Nema 14-50 in two different locations. Nema 14-50 was 8KW (proper cabling will yield around 7,776 Watts if voltage is above 242v @ 32amp) charge rate, while the Tesla V2 charger was 11.6 kw charge rate (242V @ 48A). 
5. Make sure you have the electrical infrastructure ready to go prior to delivery. The 120V at 12 AMP (base charge rate) is seriously slow/trash. :)
6. Put a passcode on the car. In the event your phone is stolen or your RFID keys are, people will be able to enter your vehicle and leave with it. Passcode is a necessity especially if your car is parked outside and somehow the RFID is triggered by thieves.
7. Sentry mode will only work if your battery charge is 20% or above.
8. Wireless QI charging mats can be purchased at amazon for half the cost of what Tesla charges.
9. Get a USB hub, with a proper power pass through capability, and a USB storage device to be able to run the dashcam software.
10. Microfiber screen cleaner and center console cleaning cloth. Remove finger prints on the screen that can give away your code to the car, plus keeps the filth of finger prints at a minimum.

That's all I can think of for now."

"AUTOPILOT CAN‚ÄôT DO 90 DEGREE TURNS YET. I learned this on day 1 playing with it and I curbed my rim. I was surprised how much you can use autopilot off of highways and was playing with it on backroads. I had it engaged and approached a big turn and nervously had my hands on the wheel but by the time I took control, the car had slowed down almost completely, stuttered with the turning, and then accelerated into the curb. Caused only minor damage but it taught me the limits of the system quickly."
Don‚Äôt read Elon‚Äôs tweets. ü§£
I also have the model 3 performance and can tell you that you won't get anywhere close to 300 mi of range. Plan on 250 max on the highway.  You will get significantly worse range while it's cold and while it's raining. You get the best range under 65 mph and when it's warm outside. The air conditioning doesn't seem to affect range but the heat definitely does
"Watch out for cops!! The car will accelerate insanely quickly and sometimes you might not notice you‚Äôre speeding because the speedometer is off to the side.

"I‚Äôd recommend setting up https://teslawinds.com/ On the browser. Shows you your current winds with respect to the car (for longer trips). A strong Texas headwind can make a huge difference as I‚Äôve found out the hard way. I‚Äôd recommend keeping a heavy duty extension cord in your car in the case of requiring an emergency charge. Like they said, there are a bunch of interesting tidbits in the owners manual, teaching all kinds of knowledge. When you have cruise going down the road, you can tap the speed limit that appears and it will change your speed to the speed limit. I call it the cop button! Also, the car on screen is always representing what the car is doing, so if you have a headlight out, it will actually show on there. Recommend saving darksky as one of your webpages for a weather radar as well."
"Soooo:

1. Like the others said, percent beats miles in term of battery display. Then keep your charge as close to 50% on a daily as much as possible. I drive about 20% of my charge in 1 day so I charge to 70% and let it drain to 50%, it would be better if I just stayed between 40-60% but I like the extra leeway. In the end, dont stress too much, most degradation i believe is about 5% in 10 years, which is hardly anything (thats with supercharging).

2. Learn the controls, parking on accident instead of cleaning your windshield is horrid.

3. Phantom breaking, it exists, its normal, so find your local spots and learn to avoid them/override during the AP commutes.

4. Go through your settings, adjust your car to what you want. Perhaps you don't care for sentry on at home, turn it off when you're at home/work/specific area automatically.

5. Don't race every single car you see lol."

damn pictures of new teslas always look sexier than my car. I would say to set your battery limit a little less than full capacity unless going on a longer trip. For daily use/commutes you do not need the full range. Especially if located in a city. Only bc putting full charge @ full capacity is not healthy for the battery.

"To be fair ‚Äúit depends‚Äù is a better answer.  The OEM 20‚Äôs are soft compound summer tires. They wear best between about 60-70F at about 42-45PSI, driving solo, easy on both speed and acceleration.

Once you‚Äôre outside of these parameters tire wear picks up - running soft (it‚Äôs a heavy car), too cold (sub 40F), too hot (over 70F), constant launches/hard-acceleration or sustained high speeds.

Rotate them regularly (~$30 at Costco), keep them at least at  42PSI.  Get winter rims/tires. Enjoy The awesome acceleration, just remember launching at every light isn‚Äôt free.  If you mistreat them, you may get less than 20k out of them."
I didn't even get 15k
Also remember to rotate your tires.  The model 3 has so little maintenance that you can easily forget.  I went 25k miles without a rotation in my LR RWD and when finally rotating found that the rears were mostly done and the front had 50% more life.
My tires are almost done after 3k miles
It's based on a fixed wh/mi and doesn't necessarily correlate with your real world range*
"I added a feature suggestion on TeslaTap for having an option to show the distance based on actual consumption like in the energy panel. Probably it will not be implemented of political reasons (it shows a short range instead of a long range, not good for image :)), but still this would be very useful.

I think this is how it should have been as standard, as the fairy tale theorethical distance based on optimal conditions is misleading and meaningless. I never get as much as 2/3 of that distance with my driving style."

"With the larger wheels and low profile tires, you get better steering response but give up ride comfort, plus the tires and wheels are more prone to damage because there is less sidewall to protect against knocks. To top it all off, the tires and wheels are generally more expensive.

"After living with MC on 120V for the first winter, I‚Äôd suggest that home charging is an almost non-negotiable game-changer.  My HPWC cost about $600 plus tax to install."
"On that note, if you have a laundry machine in your garage you might have a cheaper alternative already installed. Check the plug (or just check all the plugs in your garage for that matter, youll see a special pattern for the higher voltage NEMA plugs). Chances are you can just buy an adapter and plug your car into that, it saved me about $1,000 of installation and only cost me a grand total of $150. I leave it charging when I go to sleep and wake up to a happy car with full (70-80%) battery!"
"Yeah I had my delivery  in week 1 of the pandemic so I survived for 2 months on drip charging with the mobile connector, but finally installed a gen 3 wall connector and omg using the drip charger so long makes me appreciate the wall connector so much more.

"I think you meant USB Solid State Drive.  USB thumbdrives and SD cards in general are pretty poor quality, have trouble sustaining the constant video write speed, and often suffer failures from sustained writing of fresh video at ~9Gb/hour."
"Yes, I find this to be rather dangerous behavior. You're backing out of a parking spot and used to flipping it into drive at 4-5 mph all the time, and one day you're in a little more of a rush and it happens to be 6 mph and you miss the chime telling you it didn't engage drive and you stomp the pedal to speed off only the accelerate really quick in the wrong direction and back into the cars parked behind you. It's come close to happening to me a couple times and it's scary. The problem is further exacerbated with one pedal driving since regen is not always the same strength. The exact same timing and pedal inputs one day can have you driving off no problem, while the next day (due to weaker regen not slowing you below 5mph) you end up accelerating the wrong direction! 

Applying brakes or limiting acceleration would be better behavior. At the least, a more aggressive warning is warranted in this situation seeing that the car is going to go in the opposite direction that you think it is! Instead it's just like ""ding ding, I see you put it in drive, but I'm going to leave it in reverse this time because I'm a dumb piece of software - good luck figuring that out!""

That turned into more of a rant than I planned on, lol. I'm a design engineer and spend a lot of time thinking about little UI things like this. My preferred solution would be stalks that don't always return to center and a mechanical lockout. That would be foolproof... much like a stick shift which is very intuitive: If you try to put move the lever from R to 1 and it doesn't slot into place, there's no mistaking that you're in gear."
It should go into neutral at least.
"I really like the Tesla all-weather ones, they are simple and super durable, plus the fit is great (2020). I was turned off by the big ‚Äú3D‚Äù logo and texture on the MAXpider ones."

"The tires I killed after 20k miles were the all seasons on the 18‚Äôs. 

But that was 18 months of flooring it at just about every chance I could find in a LR RWD. They were rotated twice before their demise."
"Omg you can rotate tesla tires at Costco?! Does this mean they sell tires for the model 3 too?

Edit: yes, they do sell model 3 tires. Huge deal because my friend told me he had to buy custom for his X (seems this is still true as Costco doesn‚Äôt show any selectable option for S or X)"
You can get your tires rotated for free if you have an America‚Äôs Tire shop close by!
Check your alignment or slow down.
"It is a good idea to check the alignment, if they are wearing out that fast you are either doin burnouts and donuts or have terrible alignment. 

Also if you drive ""spirited"" rotate your tires at more frequent intervals, like 5k mi or lower."
"It's really not, especially when you think you have 200mi but really only have 170.... That's more anxiety.... Having 80% vs 60% is pretty clear tho and just know where SC are when you hit 50%...

Better yet just always use the in car nav and you never have to worry just drive and it will navigate you when it needs too. A tip I'd say use is on road trips or when your out driving, don't charge until it hits 15% and then you really only need to stop for 15-20min to hit 50-60%. Stop more frequently for less time and overall your still stopping for less time then ""filling"" to 80%"
Totally agree! I have no idea why people prefer to see percentage. Percentage doesn't tell me anything!
Does your phone show percentage of battery or number of minutes left? Exactly.
"I did the same.  Ran a 240v circuit to the garage and plug in each night.  Cost me $300CAD (the power cable was expensive, as I needed to have armored cable in the garage).  I use the NEMA 14-50 adapter that came with the car."
"This is what a Tesla rep advised me to do saved me about $1,000 too I only paid $40 for the adapter from Tesla‚Äôs website and It‚Äôs such a relief. Up until he told me that I thought the $1,000 wall charger was the only option"
"Conflicting info I‚Äôve seen on this, but that *has* to be the case, right?

For those of us getting our cars before we get a home charging solution installed, I am hoping it‚Äôs cool to use Superchargers right off the bat for a few weeks."
This is a bug we recently discovered as well. It should be getting fixed.
There‚Äôs an app for that as well
"I think he means when the car is too deep asleep. Like sometimes you have to ""wake"" the car with a door handle or your phone before it registers the button on the charger."
"The Tesla charger has the ability to control it wirelessly which was an option that didn‚Äôt exist with V2.

I suggest for the NEMA 14-50 plug to have two mobile chargers; one for home and one for car. So you can charge at home and when you leave to go somewhere you don‚Äôt have to unplug and drag the chord with you. 

If you install the V3. You can leave your mobile charger in the car and have the different plug types available. Common ones are NEMA 6-50 14-50 and trash 5-15. 

Tl;dr It‚Äôs really about cost preference and how
Much driving you do. Both will recharge you to max overnight. But one will give you a little more juice if you gotta go somewhere after a long drive. Wiring will cost you about the same regardless if V3 or NEMA charger. 

 The speed at which you charge your vehicle will vary greatly. But the cost is higher with V3 to install and purchase than the NEMA; by about 300 to 400 dollar more at minimum if not buying a second mobile charger. 

The difference in charge rate from 20% to 70% for the V3 vs NEMA charger is big too. 45% faster charging with the V3 than NEMA. 

To give you an idea; it would take 6 hours to charge from 20 to 80% with NEMA. With the V3 it would take about 3 hours 20 minutes."
"The suggestion is based on lithium battery chemistry.. The lower the Depth of Discharge the longer recharge life the battery will have, and keep overall capacity.

It's for the sake of consistency.. you'll see complaints about range degradation in 2 or 3 year old cars, because they're consistently charged to 90% and then let the batteries drop to 20% (DOD Delta of 70%) because of environmental, commute, or just lack of awareness.

We have seen lithium batteries go from 2000 recharges to well over 4000 recharges by keeping DOD low. Here's an excerpt:

 [https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how\_to\_prolong\_lithium\_based\_batteries#:\~:text=In%20theory%20such%20a%20mechanism,and%20500%20discharge%2Fcharge%20cycles.](https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries#:~:text=In%20theory%20such%20a%20mechanism,and%20500%20discharge%2Fcharge%20cycles.) 

>Similar to a mechanical device that wears out faster with heavy use, the depth of discharge (DoD) determines the cycle count of the battery. The smaller the discharge (low DoD), the longer the battery will last. If at all possible, avoid full discharges and charge the battery more often between uses. Partial discharge on Li-ion is fine. There is no memory and the battery does not need periodic full discharge cycles to prolong life."
I take mine through touchless car washes
"Sometimes when you lane switch the turn signal will not disengage. Normally it isn‚Äôt a problem depending on the type of turn you make it automatically disengages. But, say I‚Äôm on the highway and I‚Äôm lane switching, I‚Äôll see that my indicator is still on. So I shift the indicator to the middle so it turns off. But, say I pull the lever to far in either turn signal direction, im now signaling for a lane switch I‚Äôm not going to make which confuses people behind you. It‚Äôs one of those things that you‚Äôll struggle with first month. But, get used to in no time. Hope I made sense."
"It will not avoid potholes or small debris (think a flat piece of plywood that could have nails in it; it will stop if there is large debris), it can‚Äôt execute 90 degree turns but will try to, sometimes shadows in the road can cause phantom braking, if it drives for 3-5seconds without any lines on the road it will start to panic (it will coast for a few seconds with no lines guiding with no prob though), and there are spots where the speed limit is set very low (highway off ramp that is a couple miles long where everyone still drives 65 mph it refuses to go >40 mph and you almost get rear ended as soon as it takes the exit and slams on its brakes; there is only one ramp around me it does this on though).

Other than that it is a mind blowing system these drives more competently than I do on highways."
"- It doesn't avoid potholes
- If a car is parked in your lane, it will brake automatically even if you have space to go around it
- Sometimes it will brake seemingly at random, due to being over-cautious. This happens a lot when travelling under a bridge/overpass
- It can't handle loss of lane markings (fairly understandably)
- Don't use it in work zones/roadworks... it can usually actually handle things okay, but don't use it anyway, because if it messes up things can go wrong really fast when lanes are temporarily closed etc

None of these are particularly bad things, generally speaking I'm glad it does them... but it can take you by surprise

Autopilot works fantastically in slow moving traffic, and on a freeway. It works fairly well on an open highway. You need to be on your toes in town, but it isn't really designed for that (not yet, anyway)

Think of it as a cruise control that keeps the distance to the car in front and stays in your lane most of the time, but you still have to be in control.

You can always choose to use only the cruise control, without the lane assist"
I thought SSD deteriorated quicker because of the constant write/rewrite?
No I meant SD card. Like [this](https://puretesla.com/product/tesla-dashcam-sentry-mode-package-usb-microsd-configured-for-teslacam/)
"I got these on amazon (currently OOS) but are generic versions of the MAXPiders and were like $99.  They fit my 2020 without issues and have no logos.

Unless you have a 3 Dual. Then it looks custom
I got the tesla brand all weather floor mats for my 2020 2 months ago and the rear mat (single) fit like a glove in a very satisfying way. I actually felt the front ones are slightly not fitted as well
"YMMV, I bought tires for my S at CostCo. This is in S Fl.

Edit: typo"
"Most Costco Tire locations have lifts rated for Tesla, if you are not sure call ahead.  Yes, great prices for member."
Is there any catch??
"Jeez everyone on this forum loves to downvote hahaha, to clarify yes it‚Äôs because I was constantly launching and doing donuts, I knew the toll it would take on the tires and did it anyway but it‚Äôs true my tires were done after 3k miles"
"It's like the gas gauge in a car, doesn't tell you how far you can go.  I find the range estimate in a gas car equally useless as the Tesla, and just as anxiety inducing. Percentage all the way!"
Did the increased the wall charger price? It used to be $500.
"My advisor just said to get the charger, you had a nice guy lol. Mine might have been a bit new...

Btw for those that don't know: its okay to get an extension cable for your car. In my house we have 3 cars in total, so my car isn't always the closest to the charger and I had to buy an extension cable, thats why it cost me around $150 for my setup, I bought one off of Amazon."
"I don‚Äôt have hard numbers or anything but i would imagine if it‚Äôs going to be a solution for a few weeks that it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, I‚Äôve just read that using superchargers as a permanent charging solution can cause some degradation over time.  Also depending on your driving habits you could use the travel charger when you can, it‚Äôs only 4-5 miles per hour max but if you don‚Äôt drive much it could make do."
"For the superchargers what you can do is observe the tesla cars that are for business use. They usually get abused at the supercharger locations and the worst I've ever seen anyone have in degradation was about 10-15% in around 300k+ miles (sorry, dont know conversion). In other words, even the most abusive driving styles will only lower your mileage by about 40-60miles after years of heavy driving. In truth, youll be charging to 70-80% daily anyway so the change won't even be noticed."
awesome thank you
Odd I‚Äôve never had it go into deep sleep while charging.
"Thank you.  I will get the Gen 3 then.  When you order from Tesla - does it take long for it to get here?

I am coming from a BMW 5 Series.  I am always a Bimmer guy and tempted to cancel my Tesla Model 3 order and order the new BMW 5 LCI.  I also really like the Tesla.  Drive about 18,000 freeway miles a year.

Such a hard decision.  Will miss little things like AM Radio, as I listen to sports and they are blacked out usually on the app stations, CarPlay, Waze, heated steering wheel.

I like the Tesla drive and the less maintenance and gas.  Think they look neat too!

Greg"
Thank you
"All of this, and to add, autopilot features work best at menial things: traffic, keeping you in a lane either on a long drive or if you need to adjust things on the fly and what extra peice of mind. For example if I need to adjust the AC or radio while on a highway I'll turn it on if it wasn't already, the steering on the model 3 seems more sensitive than other cars I've driven, smaller inputs seem to have more pronounced results, so if you're trying to adjust your vent direction in the AC menu, it's not hard to drift within your lane or even out of it if you're not careful. 

Also never use it in construction zones, if you'd we orange signs, take control, it's not the place to be lazy or experiment with just how good it is or isn't.


Otherwise treat it like you're helping a student driver, keep watching the road, mirrors etc, it takes work out of driving which can reduce fatigue, but it absolutely needs attention Incase it hits a scenario it can't handle. You don't wanna be face down in memes when your car decides a trucks shadow  is an impassable object and slams on the brakes."
"An ssd is designed to take write cycles much better than a usb/sd card due to it's intended use.

USB, SD, SSD are all using NAND memory for storage. The NAND chips used for an internal SSD are normally designed/selected to be better than the other two, as most internal SSDs, are designed to be stuck in a computer, written to constantly by the operating system, in either the swap partitions or page files when you run out of ram, or have files shuffled/rewritten/deleted/modified by the user. [Some of the best current consumer SSD lines have been tested to take Petabytes of data before they fail.](https://www.ontrack.com/blog/2018/02/07/how-long-do-ssds-really-last/) Basically, if your ssd lasts past the infancy stage, it's sticking with you for a really long time"
Get a large capacity drive and it will spread the writes around to lengthen the drive‚Äôs life.
"OK, it works but YMMV.  SSD in have much higher sustained read and write speeds, as well significantly greater over-provisioning for write durability.  

SD card write speed is highly variable, and constant churn on small volumes can wear-out/corrupt a drive.  

At the moment TeslaCam is writing 4x ~5mbit/s video streams, trimmed roughly hourly.  21mbit/s works out at around 9.4Gb/hr of driving.  We‚Äôll only get more video not less as the firmware progresses.  

For less than the price these higher-end SD cards you can grab 120/250Gb portable SSD."
"Similarly, I got these: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z9BC5YL/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z9BC5YL/) 110 and in stock now. Looks great"
More advice - don't drive near this guy :-)
"$500 for the charger plus tax, plus an electrician in my area charging around $300-$500 for installation so roughly around $1,000 total"
"Oh interesting I never knew that I might actually have to  do that myself only downside to my current setup is I‚Äôm only able to reverse into the garage if I‚Äôm planning on charging, minor inconvenience but after a long day I feel like it‚Äôs the last thing I want to do haha"
"I haven't thought to check whether the regular radio on the tesla 

1. exists
2. plays AM stations 

lol

Your shipping times will vary based on COVID related concerns, environmental, or city issues.

In October of 2019, I got my car in 2 days. I ordered it Saturday, took Delivery on Tuesday. I would have had it on Monday, but had to work with the bank to get financing on Monday. I thought I had two weeks (which was the original estimate.) I don't know what the wait times are right now, but I can imagine it being 4 weeks.

 I got my V2 charger in December of 2019 in about 1 week from order. It was enough time to order the necessary wires and breakers for me to run my own installation."
"I paid for the whole speedometer so I‚Äôm going to use the whole speedometer, haha all jokes aside I got the car with the intention of using it as a track/fun car, not complaining about the tires just saying I went through them quickly"
"I feel that lol, something I've been planning is actually running the extension cable along the ceiling (itll be visible but its a garage so I don't mind that its visible) and leaving the end by the entrance, effectively it'll be like an externally installed station charger but i can disconnect it whenever and take it with me when I move, so I think its a lot better than an official wall charger installation."
"People say buy experiences not things. IMO owning a tesla is an experience.

I'm 88 weeks in and it still feels like I got it yesterday. It's just awesome every time I get in.

People also say money can't buy happiness. Ok, true, but this is getting awfully close."
"Fuck, mine is so dirty. Now I feel bad."
Nice cleaned car. We have not washed our since the Pandemic started.
"Look at you, showing off how clean your car is! Making me feel bad about mine...\[sniff\]"
100%  Every time I sit inside this gorgeous piece d'art I experience the same feeling as that first day....
I just had my teslaversary too!  Congrats!
Model 3 has a beautiful interior
Which floor mats are those?
"How do you clean your carpets?  Or do you just get it detailed?  

Congratulations too!  I'm just shy of 70 weeks owning, best damn decision I've ever made!  An experience is correct!"
"Mine is a week old, hope it looks like yours in 51 more..."
"It‚Äôs such a nice place to be! The riding position, the seats, everything about the car I just love. Do you find yourself just wanting to go for joy rides?"
"I love my Model3 SR, but after 29K miles I saw the battery charging only to 200mi out of the 220mi. Is that normal?"
Couldn't agree more. I see this view every single day and I still admire this photo. Best interior of any car in the world. We are lucky af.
Wondering: do you ever drive it? I noticed there are zero creases in the driver's seat. ; )
I sneak out to my garage daily to walk around mine and admire its curves. Beautiful car.
Hard reset... I have. First they told me the car was learning... then to reset.. then that the battery was healthy and it was normal... don‚Äôt know what do believe...and I am afraid that if I convert to a SR+ I won‚Äôt see a different in the mileage
"Look at your actual mileage per trip. My screen shows 201, but when I look at the actual mileage of my commute I am actually where I should be for a SR. It all depends on how you drive it and your climate settings. The number on the screen is an estimate based of your habits.
I changed my AC settings and noticed a slightly higher number."
[deleted]
People only say that stuff because they don't know what to buy.
Same lmao
Seems like the perfect time to clean it
https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-3-all-weather-floor-liners
I‚Äôd ask service about it
"Hi, I‚Äôm replying 63 days later!

Do not charge every night.  Let your miles get very low and then charge.  I saw this reduction too and then I let it get down to about 20 miles of charge left and I charged my SR to about 90% and I got all the miles that had been dropped back."
What faults may I ask?
Or the money to buy it.
Yeah I got my model 3 SR+ a couple months ago and my neighbor was pissed when he found out it only cost $2k more than his SUV he just bought
They are actually Weathertech with Tesla branding. Reasonably priced considering.
I did about 3 months ago when it was around 209 miles and they said it was normal...  but not sure if it is
[deleted]
Also curious.
We‚Äôre all pretty lucky to be owning Teslas that‚Äôs for sure.
Have you tried resetting the car completely?
You can just tap the drive stock down once to have a regular adaptive cruise control ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt do any steering whatsoever. Other points I agree with or are personal preference.
"Hmm the only one I would agree with is wind noise. I think you need to book a service appointment and read the drivers manual, because the car can do most of the things you say it can‚Äôt:

Blind spot warning: my Model 3 does have blind spot warning, and it works well. Saved me twice already. Book a service appointment if yours doesn‚Äôt work.

Cruise control: press down once on the right stick (mine works in heavy rain, so if yours doesn‚Äôt, might wanna book an appointment and see why)

Windshield wipers: press down on the left stick. Press the left stick button if you want to spray windshield fluid and wipe at the same time.

Trunk: water for me rolls out, maybe one or two droplets gets in the trunk?

Suspension: have you driven other EVs? Because of the battery, they‚Äôre almost twice as heavy as comparable ICE vehicles. And the ride is pretty smooth still, def smoother than most vehicles I‚Äôve been in."
I can agree with all of these.
"Adding a rear Spoiler will prevent rain from entering the trunk, but I agree they should have done this at factory for all Model 3a instead of only Performance model."
"I 100% agree. I just know that haters sometimes like to say ""Value experience over possessions"". ...I do what I want, and value what I want. Mind ya business."
[deleted]
"I think it's a perfectly valid expression that makes sense. Going on a trip somewhere with family/friends is something you'll never forget. In this case of buying a car, a Tesla will enable you to have great experiences as well on road trips etc.

So buying a Tesla could either be an experience, or it could also enable you to have more/better experiences."
"I haven‚Äôt experienced that personally, so was unaware. I‚Äôve driven through some pretty solid rain but apparently nothing that bad yet. If it happens with just droplets of rain maybe see if there‚Äôs something the service can do about it, because mine held just fine through the rain."
(You probably shouldn't be using it then anyway)
"I test drove a LR MSM and that used to be my least favorite color until I saw one up close and personal. Almost got that color, if it wasn‚Äôt $1000 extra, plus I love white the most. Congrats!"
MSM is my favorite color. So glad I got it for my LR model 3. That looks great with the white interior.
Those red break calipers just hit different ü§§
"The longer you have it, the more you will love it."
Congrats!! This is the color i'm gonna get but LR instead.
Same car as mine...love this colour mix. Thinking of doing a chrome delete--what do you think?
"""there are many Model 3's but this one is mine!"""
Congrats. It‚Äôs beautiful. Team white interior <3
*Heavy Breathing*
"I remember right after I took delivery of my MSM LR RWD...I saw one with the white interior.  Soooo jealous, that‚Äôs my favorite color combo."
Nice!!
Congrats. Take good care. You'll burn the rubber like warm butter
Congrats!
White with black rims looks so good.  Only thing you need to add after the fact is chrome delete.

I guess he likes a nice healthy breakfast of DUST first thing in the morning.
Only took me three times to post!  Note not a Dodge Challenger
"cool vid!

which model 3 do you have ?"

"Turbo diesel trucks get more offended than muscle cars, when you are quicker than them."
Hahahaha I love doing this in my Model 3.  People get so pissed.
"Just another douche in a muscle car
Love it....can‚Äôt wait to get my Tesla üò©"
Good job Tyler.
I‚Äôm surprised he kept up with you at the very beginning.  I figured you‚Äôd be gone immediately and he‚Äôd slowly catch up the faster you two went.
Nice I enjoy that feeling too. Without polluting the planet.
I like how you gave him hope for the first second or two then shattered his ego.
Bye ugly Camaro
he ate dust in the morning
Tesla go Vrrrrrrr
Always brings me joy showing up some douche in a obnoxious sports car. Nice work OP!
I want an option to be able to change the tone on the horn so it sounds like a reving engine.  That would so freak the other driver out ... what?? I thought the car was electric... LOL. Great job smoking them!
Electrified him
or Egg on his face ...
M3P
Took 3 1000 mile roadtrips and I drive 100 miles a day for work.  Also my wife steals the car during the day when I am sleeping from working nights.  We named her Electra and she is a lovely addition to our family.
"i did this too. i'm not like into forcing ppl to drive tesla but i took 2 vacations back to back and went almost around the east part of US ( the whole ) hit 3k miles in  11 days.

Edit : ""i'm not like into forcing ppl to drive tesla but"" said this because i love the car and sometimes it might sound obnoxious."
Had this demonstrated to me twice on the highway today. I love it when I go to pass and you see a billow of smoke come out the exhaust... in your rear view mirror.
I haven‚Äôt had any pissed reactions yet.  The one corvette I met at a stoplight had more questions about the car than negative reactions to losing.
"Weird, nobody around here gets pissed when they get beat. Most people are just amazed and want to know more."
Thanks.
That‚Äôs what happened!  At first I thought he was just being ridiculous and wanted to show off.  When I realized he wanted to race I gave it full amps.
Or like a beep beep similar to what‚Äôs on a kids bike.  So when you annihilate the individual you take their pride with it.
He was shocked
">	M3P

Poor guy (the Camaro)"
"I think it's a little misleading to say you only care about economics if you sprung for the performance model.

That being said, I'm glad you had it because you smoked him by a wide margin"
Did you give the car a name too?
Hmmmm. My car's name is Electra as well. We're twinning with the name.
"Or the ‚ÄúMeep Meep‚Äù like the roadrunner used to throw out before he zoomed away from Wile E. Coyote.

"Not sure about other EVs but the 1st gen Volt had a pedestrian horn separate from the regular horn, it was a meek, mild, quieter horn you could use to honk at pedestrians to let them know that they might be in the way (and can't hear your car to know)."
That‚Äôs true!  The long range would have been more economical.  I also care about the adoption of EVs moving forward and I knew I would be an ambassador for the technology.  I have 3 referrals so far as people are just blown away by the technology.
Wifey
Nice!  My wife's nickname when she gets crazy is Petra so I only felt it was fitting to call our new baby Electra.
This!!!!
"You can essentially put your car into long range mode, via the driving settings.

It‚Äôs nice to be able to electrify them everyone in awhile....With the flick of a button my Model 3 turns into the M3P Turbo.

I enjoy chill mode for normal driving though."
"Somebody tweet this at musk, he might just do it!"
For the first month I drove in sport mode.  One day for shits and giggles I switched to comfort and haven‚Äôt gone back.
Mine needs to up her neck and core strength.
"Coming from Prius V, Prius C, Sonata Hybrid and currently driving Pacifica Hybrid along my M3, this is so much me and my wife. The V, which I drive for the longest, was so drab and boring I joked it goes from 0-60 in under a minute. I still have to get over the habit of flooring it to pass another vehicle on the freeway, like I HAD to on any of my older cars."
"I have a separate profile for when I‚Äôm driving my Stealth Performance with my girlfriend. It puts me in Chill mode, stopping me from accelerating too aggressively. 

Yesterday I was pointing down a very steep hill and launched harder than I ever have. I forgot to put on the girlfriend profile. She wasn‚Äôt impressed. 

Lots of apologies were required. 

Feature Request: when both of our phones are connected to Bluetooth, choose the girlfriend profile automatically."
"very fitting, Im not allowed to go full throttle with my wife in the car...anymore"
Hahah it‚Äôs funny cause it‚Äôs true
"Why do women generally not like intense acceleration?  (yes, I'm in same boat as most here, and I only have the LR RWD!)"
"LOL, love this"
My wife and I came to an agreement where I politely ask/warn her to put her head back any time I‚Äôm about to hit the accelerator.
"Love the stealth performance however, like so many of you, my wife despises full blast off. One of my favorite feelings so she gets to deal."
"Been driving it now 6 months, still an incredible rush to hit the ‚Äúgas‚Äù it‚Äôs amazing. She screams every time.  RE the comments above apparently I have also caused her a neck problem. Lol.  I have to give plenty of warning and still the screams. Sensational."
I'll make you all jealous now... I life in Germany and I'm slowly getting my wife used to higher speeds. Yesterday we made 220 km/h without drama. Looking forward to exceeding the M3LR max speed of 233 km/h so that the P3D finally was worth it.
"Maybe add a gravol dispenser too?

Edit. Gravol not gravel"
"> I joked it goes from 0-60 in under a minute

My fiancee's car is referred to as going 0-60 ""in theory"""
"Oh I didn't know profile cover settings as well, I thought just only seat and steering wheel configurations."
"Yup, I do the same thing.  Tyler+Meg mode is split air settings, chill mode, and less aggressive regen braking."
"When I did a test drive, my wife almost barfed. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like that, felt like the hulk ride at universal‚Äù. That‚Äôs when I knew I had to buy."
"Yup, that was definitely a ""one time"" event in our household too. LOL"
220 km/h is 136.7 mph
"It isn't all settings, but it also includes

- Heat/AC settings
- Radio station (or whatever else you're listening to)
- Volume
- Chill mode (or not)
- Mirrors

And probably some other things I've not noticed"
"Yeah I tried it once, she wasn't keen. Slowly worked down through the different levels of getting told off until we found a balance

I'm allowed about 30% throttle off the line, rising to about 40% once we're moving. If we're at speed (40-60mph) then 2/3 throttle for an overtake seems to be survivable, although is accompanied by the missus clutching at her seatbelt.

Although tbh, I don't mind too much - when we're on a long journey I'm in chill mode anyway for range, and I can play Stoplight Surprise when I'm on my own"
Good bot
"Lots and lots of other settings. Autopilot on/off, following distance, top speed offset, NoA on/off, acceleration and steering modes, regen level and stopping mode (creep/normal/stop)... almost everything that can be switched in the vehicle menus really."
Regen braking settings!  Also speed limit settings too.
"Yes, split temperature is also a part of the girlfriend profile. She‚Äôs always cold."

This is awesome gandu harsh
I did the same thing too! I had a hot wheels model s pinned to the wall above my work computer
You are the ideal listener for the Tesla Tales podcast where Tesla owners are interview how they got to the point to afford one.
Great find. I've been looking for something like this for exactly that reason. Something to have on the bottom of my monitor. There every day to show what I am working towards.
"I have wanted a Tesla for years. But it was only about a year ago that I it became much more of a reality for my wife and I. Now we are (hopefully) going to be getting a model Y in the next week or 2.

Just keep working and you too will have your Tesla!"
Yup i got a miniature drom this link[miniature](yalayolostore.myshopify.com/products/1-32-tesla-model-x-diecast) and i keep it on my study desk always it makes me feel closer to my dreams
Having something like that is a great reminder!
I thought I talked myself out of switching from white to black...but now...
Wow!  One of the best looking black vehicles I have ever seen.
Ahh it looks beautiful! Luckily those rims only come on the PUP or I would have upgraded to those now ha
I have same config. Where you located?
Man that looks great! I‚Äôm going blue with white seats but now I want black again. Wish there was a way to know which color combo was most likely to get to me first. Annoying that the combo could mean months difference
Beautiful.
Beautiful! I‚Äôm scheduled for mine on Saturday!
I ordered white on white (still waiting) but now re-thinking. Your car looks awwwwesome! Enjoy!
"I didn't want black, but... 

I know there was some love/hate with those rims, I love them."
Wow! I got black too! Now I‚Äôm pretty pumped! Can‚Äôt wait to get mine. Thanks for posting
amazeballs!
Gorgeous looking congratulations
"My exact config!  Taking delivery next week. I can‚Äôt wait, it looks so clean."
Exactly what I'm ordering when I get my Y. Looks incredible!
How come your car is build so well. Mine has a lot of panel gaps and misalignments. Not fair :( sad
This pictures is a great reminder of why I‚Äôm waiting for my black Y to show up
How you like it so far? Did you get the black / wood interior too?
What does PUP stand for.
Every car detailer on YouTube commenting on black cars says they would never get one. They're a nightmare to keep looking good.
I have always loved black cars but like it even more on the Y with blacked out trim and door handles
"I am in San Jose and picked up from Fremont factory today.
Ordered Day 1 but I don‚Äôt think that matters much as current delivery estimate is 4-8 weeks anyway"
"Mine have few issues too. I reported about 7-8 issues with trim misalignment, small scratches, have to use high force to close driver side front and rear door. Dropping it off on Friday to get those fixed. Nothing too major though. 

I think all black look kind of masks some of the imperfections in the pictures but its definitely not perfect"
I came to ask the same question.
"I‚Äôve had plenty of black cars and I find this to be way overblown.  Yes, they get dirty like any car.  But I don‚Äôt think they look that bad when they‚Äôre dirty.  For me yellow is by far the worst color when dirty."
"I owned a succession of black Porsches, and can second this. Even a small coating of dust or pollen makes the paint look bad. They looked *awesome* when spotless, but I was spending almost $80 a month just on keeping it clean. So I switched to dark greys on the cars since, and haven‚Äôt had the same problem."
"Reminds me of a line from an old Living Color song, referencing a bride on her wedding day:

""She looks as lovely as she's ever gonna get"""
Post some more pics if you can. I‚Äôm in love already
I reported these issues but they said they couldn‚Äôt fix it since it is within their ‚Äúgap margin.‚Äù I got this car during Santa Clara quarentine so I didn‚Äôt bother too much with them. I might go to the service center again once the virus clears out. It is a 60K car and I want it to look good.
"How does the inspection work? Do you have to figure out ALL the problems before you drive off? Do you report them and have someone come to check on the items you pointed out to verify? If you miss one and find it later, are you sore out of luck?"
I m guessing its Performance Utility Pickup. But want to be sure.
"Posted a walk around video in another post that should show more angles:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/h05tcy/got\_few\_requests\_to\_show\_more\_angles\_and\_pictures/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/h05tcy/got_few_requests_to_show_more_angles_and_pictures/)"
"Ok. They are still reviewing my request. I selected an appointment for Fremont Service centre. Lets see what they say. 
I am not too worried about the panel gaps as they are not extreme but not able to close the doors without slamming them is a major one"
"I did the express touch-less pickup from the Factory. It gives you 12hrs or 100 miles to report any issues (thats what it said in the pick up email from Tesla).
So you drive it home and inspect it yourself. Schedule service in the app where it will have categories for various types of issues and you will have to add description and pictures along with them. Once service is scheduled, Tesla will go through the issues you reported and ask for more info if needed."
"Performance upgrade package. So both performance and the package (21‚Äù rims, brakes, suspension)"
"I think that‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs model y. I need to pull it really hard to close the door (maybe not slamming, but i have to pull the driver‚Äôs side door really hard to close it properly)"
"Perfect, thank you!"
"Awesome, I know what I'll be doing all day after pickup!"
Good news. Sounds like the best way to handle pickup.
Nice. Thank you.
"Its same for me. Driver side front door is the worst. Every time I get in to drive, I have to close it 2-3 times to get it to close properly. Also its the most used door so really want to get it fixed. Should be a reasonable ask for $70k car."
"Very few fit/finish issues, BTW. A couple panels aren't exactly right, but they're within an acceptable margin of error. The cover to the charge port isn't totally flush; Tesla actually ordered the replacement part before I even arrived to take delivery, so they offered to send out a mobile service tech to fix it once the part arrives. I appreciate their willingness to drive 5 hours from the nearest service center to fix issues as minor as this."
Congrats!  Very happy for you.  Your face will hurt for a long time due to the huge grin you will have every time you drive it!
"Congratulations, I hope it is the beginning of a wonderful new journey for you üëç"
She‚Äôs a beauty!
Congrats! Love the geminis. Got more pics? Thanks.
ENJOY!
I received a 12xxx number. Some received 13k to18k. The first two of the 5 digit sequence
Congrats on the come up :)
What did you vin# start with?
Did they bring it to you?
Sexy beast
"5 hours, WOW! Where are you at in the world? Haha"
It is wonderful to see another fairly clean delivery. I pick mine up tomorrow. Congratulations!
"I see, the sequence at the end? Then I'm 10xxx"
"It's 10XXX at the end, which I believe is the important part."
"They said I qualified for home delivery, but it would take a few more days- maybe a week. I'm already making payments on the car and on insurance, so I declined home delivery despite the distance. Plus I wasn't confident a stranger would know where and how to navigate these rural dirt & gravel roads so as to avoid kicking up rocks, mud, etc."
"West Texas- Midland. About 4 1/2 hours to El Paso, Fort Worth, or Austin. Car was brought waiting in San Antonio- 5 hours away. Ironic to have a Tesla in the heart of oil country!"
"How long after it arrived in San Antonio before they delivered it.  

I live in Amarillo and it‚Äôs 5 hours from Fort Worth and my Y arrived today.  Still waiting for delivery notification"
"To be clear, I drove to San Antonio to take delivery; they advised it would be a few days before they could arrange for a driver to take the car to me. Don't know exactly how much longer it adds to the wait, but you should hear from them within a day or two.

I would consider calling the delivery center where it's located and talking to someone about getting something scheduled. The squeaky wheel gets the oil, ya know..."
Looks like Michelangelo painted the ceiling of that Y.
Looks great... and those back seats are actually lined up!  congrats!
Awesome! Great pic.
Man that's badass
How do people find the view out the rear window? It looks quite small and limited.
"Hah, did a facetime with a friend while parked in the car. Like 2 minutes they asked WTF I was, it looked like they were in a painting or something."
Still waiting for mine. You're killing me! :)
I should have said the L & R seats are even and consistent level with each other. üôåüèº
WOW
I rode in the back of mine for the first time the other day. It‚Äôs an absolutely gorgeous view out the top of that thing. It also give tons of headroom (I‚Äôm 6‚Äô) and makes sitting in the back feel very airy. It‚Äôs one of the best features of the vehicle!
Do all the windows roll down to the door or is there a nub of window left?
Thanks for sharing this pic!
"Nearly üòâ

Edit: I can see my silly comment wasn‚Äôt appreciated üòÜ"
"I got used to it after 2-3 days. But, not ideal."
It‚Äôs awful
Yeah its not great. But you can use the rear camera on the screen which is fantastic
Yeah it was small coming from my Model 3 but I got used to it in 2 days.
"I think it depends on how often you use it. Maybe I‚Äôm some outlier but I rarely look at what‚Äôs going on behind me. So while the view is a lot more limited than my subaru, it‚Äôs a non issue for me. If it‚Äôs a cop pulling me over I‚Äôll see the lights. Same with headlights at night etc. just my $0.02!"
"We have a tall family (I‚Äôm 6‚Äô-6‚Äù and my sons are 6‚Äô-2‚Äù) and we‚Äôre scheduled for a MY test drive in a few weeks.  I‚Äôm anxious to see how accommodating the back seat legroom is in comparison to the M3 (which is a non-starter).  I understand there are 4 more inches of legroom over the M3, but that the rear crossbar is a problem for taller rear seat passengers...especially in recline. What‚Äôs your take on the back seat?"
Rear windows do not roll down all the way.
Sounds like [poor scanning.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juOhr3YK09s)
"Well my family isn‚Äôt as y‚Äôall as yours, but I would have plenty of room to sit behind myself at 6‚Äô.  That said, you guys are in another league!  It‚Äôs certainly the roomiest crossover I‚Äôve ever been in...it‚Äôs even roomier than my Audi Q7."
Whyyyyyyyyy. The car can freaking drive itself but they can‚Äôt engineer a window that goes down all the way lol. My 2 year old is going to be pissed.
Thanks for the funny video!
Idk! I didn‚Äôt design it lol must be something in the door that‚Äôs preventing the entire window to go down.
"Sounds like a good decision. There's no way I would buy from Tesla unless I lives within 20 minutes of a Service Center, which I fortunately do."
"The more people do it, the more attention is getting drawn to issues like these. People need to stop ignoring the faults of tesla, because the company will destroy itself if the customers let it run rogue. Good job, you made a service to all the other buyers."
"That sucks man. Sorry to hear it. 

Please let us know how the return process goes. I‚Äôm curious about the refund of sales taxes and unwinding financing. Best of luck."
I would have done the same.
"Sorry to hear it ‚òπÔ∏èJust to clarify, you did a return (which is why the 12 month blackout) rather than refused delivery? AFAIK there are no strings attached to the latter‚Äîthough the duration/mileage isn‚Äôt clear."
"You made the right decision. Tesla needs to address these customer service issues, let alone these build issues.  It will make or break Tesla‚Äôs reputation in the long run."
Great decision. Live to fight another day.
"thats what happens when tesla can turn it around and sell it to another person right away, until demand dies down they dont need good service and i wouldnt expect it"
I think Tesla needs to consider outsourcing Tesla Service management to a third party firm because they are not able to adequately train or manage their service personnel internally.
You‚Äôre making me think twice about buying one when I live 4.5 hrs from a service center.
"> I love Tesla and still do.

They sold you a defective car, then tried to stuff you with a $1,100 bill for good measure, and this is your response?"
"Had the same experience with a model 3. Ordered, paid in full, went to a service station 5+ hours away to see the new car with broken roof glass, popped out tail light, dent in the front, and a few scratches. What made me mad is I flew there, had to get last minute tickets to return since I wasn't taking the car in that condition, after they refused to help me out with a return ticket, I had to reason with them to give me a ride to the airport since no Ubers or Taxis were available at the time. The whole wait they wanted me to look at 5 other trims so they could execute sales. I swear people fault Elon for this, but so many under him can't put one foot in front of the other on their own. My personal experience has deterred me from purchasing a Tesla since I cancelled from this experience until a few days ago when I ordered a model y. I'm super excited but am nervous the experience will be similar with my previous order. They have great products and are such a cool company, but quality and control and customer relations needs improvement."
"I would have done the same thing. That is ridiculous. You might even consider taking them to small claims court to get the $1,100 back. Guess I got lucky that my Model Y has 0 issues."
Have you decided what care you will be getting next?
I-pace
You called a tow truck or you called Tesla roadside assistance and was sent a tow truck?
" I just don‚Äôt get the fact why people pay for a car north of 50K ,car has already known issues coming from a falty production line, even for a car like Camry or civic or accord this will not be acceptable, I just don‚Äôt get the double standard!"
"All from an unsecured hubcap.

1 sec... I gotta go check something. brb"
Yikes! Sounds like a nightmare. Glad they finally agreed to cover towing. I would‚Äôve never been as patient with you and would have told me to sue me. Probably plenty of cause for counter suit and a huge PR nightmare.
"I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt do mobile service for you. Why would they make you drive from OKC to KC in the first place? And that‚Äôs way more than 2.5 hours, that‚Äôs like 6 hours and way farther than the Plano center.

Edit: nvm I think I put the pieces together from other replies. Now I‚Äôm just confused on how it is the 3rd trip. That is insane that they would call the tow truck then expect you to pay it after confirming the repair was warrantied."
"That sucks to hear.  I have faced similar frustrations with other manufactures. Like many things in life, it seems to be what customer service person you are dealing with. This seems unfortunate and a shop issue. I would have probably done the same thing to be honest. For the record, you have now locked yourself out of buying a model Y in the same trim for a year. I‚Äôm sure you can fight that based on the circumstances."
Unfortunate but understandable. Service and support are the main things holding this company back. Hopefully they will prioritize.
Get aaa. Just have it. Always.
"Any updates on your return? 

I ended up ""returning"" my model Y within 24h. Discovered a dent in the hood, dent in back 1/4 panel,  and missing paint all within 10 minutes of taking delivery. Delivery guy confirmed new panels would be ordered from factory. Not having that in writing, I went back to dealership the next day and was told they would only paint it. 

Service said they could ""blend it in"". But I don't want body shop paint on my brand new car. Dealership agreed and ordered me a new one. 

I'm sure they'll flip it. 

Still no word on returned financing, taxes etc."
"I certainly understand the frustration especially the wasted time. But returning the car after they agree to paying the tow, albeit not sure which group, feels a bit of an overreaction. I remember when my Nissan Altima had engine issues. The dealer wouldn't cover it under drivetrain warranty. I wrote a few emails to Nissan corporate a few times and after about 3 months they refunded me $4000 for the engine replacement. I didn't blacklist Nissan after that. There's going to be incompetent people everywhere. I won't let that ruin my fondness for a brand."
This is concerning. You going to get a Model 3 instead?
"Um isn‚Äôt the model y not out yet?

Edit: i didn‚Äôt realize they started deliveries in March. Don‚Äôt know how I didn‚Äôt hear"
"So you would seriously accept this sort of abuse from a company if only you did not need to travel a long distance to receive said abuse?    This won't be fixed until consumers start standing up to this BS, as OP did.   I applaud him."
"Will do. The Dealer in the store didn‚Äôt really know how it all works. Like if I get a check, who pays back the loan etc. The store leader said he has worked for Tesla for 5 years and never had a return. Again, the car issue is one thing, but it was just the fact that this was a simple thing that should have been resolved, and it turned into a mess. Tesla still hasn‚Äôt paid the Tow company to my knowledge. I was getting phone calls from the tow truck driver all day yesterday asking what‚Äôs going on. When I left, as I mentioned above Tesla was arguing internally which department should pay it."
"Yes, I formally returned the car to Tesla and gave the keys back. The 12 month blackout period does not apply to anyone that refuses delivery to my knowledge. I accepted delivery, drove it for 2 days and on my way home to OKC this saga started."
Can you elaborate on the difference? Just curious.
Is that still true after they've sold the car and it's been returned? I guess if there wasn't a title change registered with the state it's still a new car?
Lol. Maybe like a dealership model
Think thrice. Tesla seems to have more reliability issues than my dad‚Äôs Land Rover
"Probably not the best word choice. The 2 days I had it before the issue were great. Amazing features, handling, and driving experience. It just went south when I had to deal with there service."
People blame Elon because the fish rots from the head
"I would suset th Volvo XC40, e-Tron, ID.4."
"I called Tesla Roadside Assistance and was sent a Tow Truck. I was told something along the lines of it will be an Owner expense if the service center finds the issue to be not covered under warranty. But if it‚Äôs a warranty issue than it would be paid by Tesla. I was sure this would be a warranty claim and so I proceeded with the tow. Yesterday, the service center 100% confirmed it was a warranty claim (as mentioned it wasn‚Äôt even bolted on), but then had to deal with the mess described above. If they took the car, fixed it and paid the tow bill I most likely would have kept the car. I really liked it! It was just the poor service, and the day long battle of trying to get ahold of someone at Tesla to help me that made me walk away. It seemed like this would be a consistent issue throughout my years of ownership."
"And they buy the car blind. As in, no test drive"
"Sorry, I should clarify. This is not the aero wheel cover. This is the plastic panel under the car. Designed for aerodynamics. It wasn‚Äôt bolted on, and started ripping off when I was going down the highway. Unlike the Model 3 this isn‚Äôt a composite cloth. It‚Äôs a thicker plastic panel, and I couldn‚Äôt drive faster than 20 MPH without it catching the road and hitting the bottom of the car."
"Sorry, the series of events may be a little confusing. I took delivery on Kansas City (that is the delivery center for my area I guess) and was going to drive it back to my house in Oklahoma City. We were exactly halfway to OKC when this happened. The Tesla Roadside person said I can limp it to service center for repair or get it towed BUT if it is found to not be a warranty repair I would be responsible for the Tow Truck costs. I opted to for tow because I was in the middle of no where Kansas, and was concerned if I tried a ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù (tape etc) that I would cause further damage and safety issues and give them an excuse to void the warranty. 

The third trip was because I left the dealer to have a discussion with Tesla customer service center on the phone and think about my options. So, after finding out from them with certainty that a warranty repair should cover any Tow costs, I went back to discuss why they weren‚Äôt following that. 

Also, because I got stuck on Sunday I had no option to call the Kansas City service center about the issue. If they were open, I would have discussed a duct tape repair with their promise it wouldn‚Äôt affect the warranty claim. Since I couldn‚Äôt do that, I didn‚Äôt want to risk it."
"Well, I had an issue with a new VW GTI about 4 years ago. A few days after I took delivery there was a loud rattle in the front of the car. The service center found that the ‚Äúshipping pucks‚Äù for the suspension were left in and rattling around. They fixed the issue and unprompted I get a call from VW apologizing and they sent me a $500 Visa gift card and a note that my suspension is warranted for an additional 2 years. Again, all I really wanted was this to be covered by Tesla and move on. Instead it turned into this."
They had years to do this
"Yes, I had posted more info on the main r/teslamotors sub.

Basically shortly after I posted on Reddit, I was told money would be sent back in 14 days. I got my down payment 14 days later, and they repaid the loan to the lender. So, all it cost me was my $100 order fee, and 20ish days of interest on the loan. Of course there is the cost of time etc as well.

Anyway, very little communication from Tesla about status, but ended up getting taken care of in the window of time they gave me. Didn‚Äôt order another one, as my issue was with more the service side of things. Think they have some work to do on that side, and that‚Äôs important to me if I plan to own a car for 5+ years."
"No, I am looking at different manufacturers. Interesting fact... if you do return your Tesla during the 7 day return policy you are locked out of buying another Tesla that is the same model and trim level for 12 months. Didn‚Äôt know that until I signed the papers."
Hmm. I don't know that I would put up with what OP received regardless of distance. But I certainly wouldn't put up with any amount of guff if I lived as far away as he does.
Everybody acts like you get outstanding customer service at car dealerships when they compare it to Tesla. I have yet to have a ‚Äúgood‚Äù dealership experience on a consistent basis. I‚Äôm not saying Tesla should follow suit nor do I agree with putting up this behavior but this is my expectation going into an interaction with any dealership for any car manufacture. I‚Äôm conditioned into thinking all dealerships sucks.
I have also been dealing with this myself and I refused delivery after inspection of the car . One person says it will go to your original method of payment and another says it will be mailed as a check. Seems from what I read online expect it no less than 30 days from the date of your return.
"A Refused Delivery is when you get the car from Tesla, but don't actually take it from them. A return is when you look at the car, say everything looks fine/agree that they'll fix stuff at the SC, but then within 7 days decide you want them to take it back.


It's basically the exact same as a package you have to sign for. If you see the box is all banged and you refuse to sign, the liability for that package isn't on you. If you sign and then realize after opening it that whatever was inside was messed up/not what you wanted, then you have to return it and it's up to the retailer's policy, ignoring the liability the shipper might have for damaging it."
"I own a Land Rover, happily, but there is no way that‚Äôs true lol."
I‚Äôd opt for the Kona EV. Probably the most reliable one
"The eTron is awful, don't do it."
"Their arguement was extremely stupid. It's their own policy and they are just trying to take advantage of you when you were in a tough spot. Good riddence.

This really sound like the tesla ""dealership"" was being run by a really bad car salesman and trying old dealership tricks. I bet they were going to get you to cover the towing charge yourself, and then pocketing the tow money that would have been paid by the company as part of the warranty repair - to them it's an extra 1100$ for free!  Corporate should fire that manager."
"... 

...

... gotta go check something... brb"
Customer service is the backbone to loyalty. A single bad experience can tarnish a brand for life. I really hope someone on the corporate level follows-up with you.
"Well, they spent those years building a fantastic car and business. If it wasn‚Äôt for that we wouldn‚Äôt be having a conversation about customer service. Can‚Äôt have it all. That said, now that they have established themselves hopefully they will focus more on service."
Damn. What about if you order and cancel before taking delivery?
"Wow, 12 months is a long time-out.  Why punish someone for that long, especially for a vehicle in high demand?"
"Exactly. This isn‚Äôt a unique issue to Tesla. Entire car industry is shit. 

Tesla needs to and can do better though. The car industry has set a pretty low bar."
I think the disappointment derives from Tesla positioning itself as different than the past. I hear you - it‚Äôs the same old Lucy holding the football routine.
Thanks!
"Yes way, it's true ""lol"". Said Land Rover Freelander has been sent for repairs at least once a year. Here's what I remember:

1. Front wiper engine (supposedly ""shouldn't have broken down at all"" - the mechanic's words)
2. Rear differential (another thing that ""shouldn't have broken down at all"") - would have costed 5 Polish average monthly wages to fix but it was still on warranty
3. Front right shocks just broke off and destroyed the tyre
4. Ongoing issue - after driving for about half hour in city (lots of starting and stopping) the engine suddenly loses power, causing the car to accelerate slooooowly

True, it's an incredibly fun car to drive, has a lot of space inside (no trouble loading things for trips) and it's very comfortable, but I'd prefer having a car that doesn't break down more often than my 12 year old Citroen C3"
"mach e.  Ford is shamelessy copying everything good about tesla, but you get established manufacturer build quality and service.  Literally ford gave all the engineering and software team model 3s to have the past few years while they developed the car."
Curious why you say that.  Seems to be selling very well in Europe.
that only works if there‚Äôs separation between dealer and manufacturer.  to do what you‚Äôre describing is effectively theft because that $1100 has to be accounted for somewhere and there‚Äôs no gap between the two sides to allow for the money to get pocketed.  the accounting software should flag it as a missing debit or credit depending on which side is trying to hide the money.
"I think that‚Äôs different as they don‚Äôt have to deal with a ‚Äúused‚Äù car, but I don‚Äôt know for sure."
"If you have quality problems, you don't want someone to go through 3 cars to find one without flaws and leave you with 2 cars that you have to sell at a discount."
"So people don't drive the car for a week, return it, and repeat every month to get a ""free car"""
My uncle was considering a Tesla. He is an older guy so I threw him to the Ford Mach E. Pretty sure he is going with that because of the above reasons.
">mach e.  Ford is shamelessy copying everything good about tesla, but you get established manufacturer build quality and service.  Literally ford gave all the engineering and software team model 3s to have the past few years while they developed the car.


Hey, it worked pretty well for Samsung"
[deleted]
Not a Tesla owner but it sounds like luck of the draw to get one without issues.
"I based it on this

https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/interesting-conversation-with-ford-mach-e-software-designer.178418/

it's bullshit?"
"Picked up new MY yesterday (June 5, 20) to join its ""older"" sister M3 in Northern Virginia! No defects I have noticed thus far. VIN 5xxx, 19"" wheels, black interior."
Looks like a tank (in a good way) compared to the 3.
Nice very nice cars
Our garage looks very similar.. but both are midnight silver metallic! Congrats!
Lucky bastard!  Enjoy üòâ
ha I have the same stable
"""Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?"""
Yes!!! My wife has  white 3 but I couldn't go white on the Y. Would be great to hear what kinds of issues you're finding (if any). I just picked up Tuesday 6/2. Already finding quite a few issues I'll have to log by Monday evening.
That one on the right got a donk!
That‚Äôs exactly the picture I‚Äôll have posted tomorrow!  Congrats!
Congrats! Virginia is for lovers! Totally miss that. Used to live in Burke for 10 years.
"Do you need two chargers wired or is there a splitter type thing?

Does charging at the same time make the process slower?"
Congratulations.
Thanks!
Thanks!
Thanks!
please post pics of your problems for others to help spot
"Sorry to hear that... So far, have not found any issues yet... But it's been less then 24 hours."
I discussed with my spouse and for now we will just stick with the one NEMA 14-50 we have installed. We anticipate it will be rare that both of us will need to charge at same time.
"I have two HPWC Tesla wall connectors installed on a single 100A circuit. I can use at most 80A. We have two Model 3s. They are limited to 48A charging so if one is plugged in it uses 48A. If I plug both in the HPWC‚Äôs have a communication wire between them and they will split the 80A at 40A each.
If you had a 60A circuit with max 48A then I think they would drop to 24A each."
"Going to post some pictures here:

What was your average energy for the trip?
Nice congrats! where are you? looks like a nice country retreat
My first MY road trip gave me serious range anxiety. It was estimated that I‚Äôd have 4% battery at arrival. I stopped for super charge.
"Just loved my experience with the Y on our first road trip. 

Took my drone along - https://youtu.be/0OXs1QD-jnw

With all the covid 19 news, we‚Äôve been practicing social distancing. Didn‚Äôt come in contact with anyone on this day long road trip.

Cleaned the supercharger with sanitizing wipes before we used it. 

90% on autopilot"
Putting the y in s3xy
So do the cars not have the Model Y badge on the back? I haven‚Äôt seen any with one on it
Congrats!
Does yours have the white interior? Looks amazing!
239 Wh/mi is the average (I think)
It‚Äôs my parents house in the White Mountains of New Hampshire
I did a super charge. Drove a total of 360 miles.
They do not. Mine only has the dual motor badge with a red line under it. I have the performance with performance upgrade.
"Nah, black interior"
"Man, really makes me want to ditch the Uberturbines and get the Gemini‚Äôs"
"I was on the highway most of the way with little traffic and kept it on autopilot the whole way. Wasn‚Äôt speeding kept it at 70 where I could, 65 or 55. I didn‚Äôt want to get pulled over. Massachusetts plates in the state of NH are ripe for the picking. I am thinking now that I have a shiny new car they are even more likely to pick me off."
"I choose the Geminis, because I live and commute on really bad roads with tons of pot holes. Plus my wife hates the black wheels."
Looks sharp! Are the Geminis covers or full wheels?
"They are covers, I haven‚Äôt taken them off yet"
Thanks...again they look great. I think I'm going to order the same when things settle down hopefully later this year. Just not sold on the big wheels and pot holes LOL
Wow white on white! What state?
"Nice! Source code showed up on Monday for myself as well. I have the pleasure to pick up tomorrow morning. 

Blue / Performance"
"Wow congrats, it really is happening! I‚Äôve got the same the same config on order with induction wheels, also ordered early Feb this year. This gives me hope. Also in LA area. 

For what it‚Äôs worth, I called Tesla earlier today to possibly change my config and the sales guy advised I hold off one more week, if I didn‚Äôt have a VIN assigned in a week then he said changing to black interior will likely get me one earlier. We shall see."
Got more pics? Looks great.
Are those the 20 induction wheels? if so can we get a pic of the tires? what are they?
"I'm waiting on a White on White PUP currently in the 2-4 week text group, hopefully that means mine might be on it's way sooner rather than later"
"Congrats!!! I‚Äôm (Nor)Cal too; ordered white/white on Feb 20, a LR-AWD+FSD w/19‚Äù and 20‚Äù (yes, made two orders lol). Which trim is yours? I‚Äôm guessing performance?

Edit: got the 2-4 weeks txt but no vin yet (for either order)"
How you like the white on white? Was debating the white interior but I really want a white exterior and not sure if it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo much‚Äù
Have had a Tesla for many years now...best car ever. You will love it
Did the delivery center stick on your front plate bracket?
What was your VIN range and any paint issues?
This is exactly like mine except mine is black exterior and black interior and I don‚Äôt even have it yet because Tesla is so disorganized.
what made you consider a Tesla?
"That looks like the one I hope to be picking up soon :)

Edit: oh nvm I ordered black seats"
Why are you blown away?
California - took delivery in Costa Mesa. Not many white on white deliveries yet so I wanted to give you guys hope. It‚Äôs happening!
Love that color - we went with white because I sometimes leave the dogs in the car for a bit. Figured the white on white with the pet mode would be very comfy for them.
"Thanks! The white looks really great so if you can hold off, it shouldn‚Äôt be that much longer."
Thanks! I‚Äôll post some more soon.
Those are the 21‚Äù uberturbines
I never got a text. VIN just showed up in the source code. So keep checking that and call as soon as you see it.
I checked every option except the tow hitch. :)
I like it. I‚Äôve always had black interiors but this color combo  and the minimalist aesthetic makes me feel like I‚Äôm driving a car from the future.
Glad your experience has been a positive one. I already love it!
"It‚Äôs a stick on holder, I pulled it off on a hot day slowly and clean off the residue"
Yes it came already on. The rear plate bracket is crooked :/
"VIN starts with 5YJ. No paint issues that I have found yet. I did have some alignment issues with the rear lights and scratches on the back of the front passenger seat. They fixed both right on the spot, which was amazing. One of the hooks in the rear seats won‚Äôt stay up so I‚Äôll have to bring it back once they get the part. I have 3 days to spot and report any issues through the app. Based on everything I‚Äôve been reading I was pleasantly surprised with the panel gaps. Not perfect but much better than I was expecting."
I have seen any black MYs out there yet. Hopefully that color is next.
"I have a brother in law who put it this way. A normal ICE car is like a flip phone. An electric car is like a smartphone. The Tesla is like an iPhone. Personally I didn‚Äôt want to give up the performance (I have an Audi S6) and love the over the air updates that add/improve the car without the need to go into a dealer for a service appointment. The software is also beautiful and easy to use. I still have some range anxiety but with the supercharger network, I‚Äôm confident that I can get to most places just fine."
The acceleration is like nothing I‚Äôve ever experienced. The only other time I‚Äôve felt that thrill was as a kid on Montezuma‚Äôs Revenge (roller coaster that accelerates from a dead stop) at Knott‚Äôs Berry Farm.
he floored it and paid for extra speed.
Wow California!! I ordered one February plz plz plz this month üôèüôè Elon I need it. When did you order?
Exactly. Any dark color just requires more power for AC. I've also ordered white
We changed our White PUP TO the white interior last week and was worried it would push us back even more. Glad to see some of these rolling off the line. After I saw a pic of a Y with the white/white it was a no brainer!
thanks
Who do you call when you see the VIN?
"Sweet!! Same here! Ok then, I'm assuming we should get our vin within a week or so then! Fingers crossed! :)"
Thanks for the info! I‚Äôll definitely be doing that.
"Oh no, sorry to hear that

The white on white looks slick tho üëçüèª"
I hope that's not the norm. All previous videos I've seen they supply it for you to install yourself. I'm going with a different front plate option and don't want to deal with this.
"completely agree.  I have a 3.    


It's always interesting to hear what draws new people in."
Yes haha
"omg, this is my exact config ‚Äî also here in california (LA) ‚Äî when did u order?"
"I ordered on February 6th, you are probably close!"
Same- So Cal white is a must for us.
"I had some early communication with a rep in March and I just called that guy back. If you call Tesla, they can probably tell you who your person is. There is a person in charge of your account until you get a VIN, then it hands off to the delivery rep."
Thanks!
"Sweet, I love the 3 but with 2 dogs + kids I needed the extra room."
Nice ü§ûü§û
"Good luck with the white interior! JK, I hope it cleans easily."
Thanks - I heard it stays clean pretty well. I hope so!
Very cool. I bought mine a few weeks ago but have an appointment to install on Monday. I got a $950 quote to have it wired. Mind letting us know how much yours cost to have wired?
"So my electrician made the same mistake as yours. The charger cable is supposed to fit into the slot on the right of it, but he put it too close to my central vac unit that I have to hang it like yours. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è also just FYI in CA they are free after tax write off."
Getting mine tomorrow! Just ran wires and ready for install! Now I just need the damn car lol
"Lol. I just got mine installed today. 

Same 18' cable."
I had mine installed a couple of weeks ago. Now it is taunting me while I wait for my second delivery appointment.
"Looks nice with the wiring in the wall. 

What's in that black case on the right? :)"
"Why'd you install it so close to the panel on the right? It's more ""gas-stationey"" if  you use the receptacle on the right side to hang the end in."
Can they be installed on an exterior wall without being damaged by weather?
Aren‚Äôt they usually silver?
[deleted]
"Wired mine myself for under $150 for all the conduit, breaker, wire, etc."
"I got mine installed for about 1200$, but it had to go from one end of the house to the other.  My price included permitting and inspections."
"Was $950 with permitting? 

Mine was $350 for wiring, conduit, breaker (Ran about 18 feet) $100 labor to assemble and mount. Permitting was the extra $200 to include the permit fee and have someone there. 

What area are you in? I‚Äôm north Texas."
"Mine was about $500 and they wired two additional outlets nearby at the same time. Its going to depend a lot on how easy it is to run the wire in your house, and how far away it is."
Re the tax write off in CA: I‚Äôm glad to hear that still exists. How do you access that? Through the state?
Yeah. Totally missed it both I and the electrician. Oh well.
Yes they can. I will probably have to mount another one on the outside when the cyber truck gets deluvered
This is Ver 3
"You mean, nema 14-50. That is a 50A ckt and cars charge at 32A with that. 0 to 100% on that is approx 13.5 hrs. 

With the Tesla Wall Charger it is a 60A ckt and charges the car at the max possible 48A. 0 to full is approx 9.75 hrs on that. 

The nema 1450 install is cheaper at approx $500 for the ckt plus electrician install. You will need a connector cable that already comes with the car.

The Tesla wall charger is more at approx $500 for the box plus approx $425 for install cost plus approx $12 for the 60A 2 pole ckt breaker. About $1000 or so. 
Plus if you put it outside your house like I did, you will need a town permit. It is weatherproof for sun, rain and snow. Which is good."
"Depends on individual use case. For me, yeah, the $35 adapter is the way to go for now since I already have a 14-50 outlet in my garage. I'll be home enough between drives that the slower charge rate is fine. My use case is not everyone's use case though. That being said, someday I'll prob spring for the wall charger too so I could leave the mobile charger in the trunk.

Remember that there are tax incentives for installed electric vehicle charging stations. Depending on where you live, it might a lot of financial sense to jump on that."
"Unless I'm not seeing something you are, the 14-50 mobile charger is $520 (and sold out). The wall charger is $500??  And even if there's a cheaper one, maybe some prefer a nicer looking hard wired wall charger.."
"And how much for the ""knowledge of how to avoid death""? üôÇ"
"$950 for labor, materials, permit and I guess I forgot to mention that I was getting it hooked up to an off peak meter. I would say it‚Äôs roughly 50ft of wire from off peak meter to charger and then maybe another 10 ft from breaker box to off peak meter. This is Minnesota thru a recommended Tesla installer. All Sheetrock/wood and all in my garage.

Others wanted $1250 and $2700 for the same job also from the Tesla recommended installers."
"Don‚Äôt forget the tax credit too. 30% of cost to install an electric charger in your home by end of 2020. I don‚Äôt believe the nema counts since it‚Äôs just an outlet. 

I‚Äôve got an older home and labor and materials alone to get 60A out to my garage is gonna run me close to $1000. Tax credit mean I‚Äôm basically getting the wall charger for free if I go that route, so why the hell not."
The mobile charger comes with the car. You only need a $35 adapter and the outlet installed unless you already have an outlet.
More the ‚Äú0.00001 chance ur house burns down and home insurance tell u to sod off‚Äù
"We're talking three wires here. Pick a breaker that doesn't exceed the load capacity of your panel, pick wire of sufficient gauge for the required ampacity given your chosen breaker, and choose conduit large enough that you don't exceed the fill factor. Connect it all up and be careful not to be stupid... granted, that's the hardest part. Set the current in the charger and get it inspected.  Start charging. 

All the information required is easily available online. Of course if you're not totally comfortable with doing these things then by all means you should pay a professional."
"Can you expound on this a bit?

I'm in Washington. Do you mean if I install a Wall Connector, I can get a 30% tax credit on that installation? And is it for the full install, or just the unit?"
That‚Äôs more about the connections than the run though.
You realize that you can pull your own permits and have the city inspector come by to verify the work?
"I was specifically most scared of getting into the panel to make the 240 volt breaker!

Plus, man, those wires are just so much more massive üôÇ

EDIT: Plus, yeah, I'd hate to be a victim of my own Dunning Kruger delusion üòÇüòÖ"
"https://envirocenter.org/ev-charging-tax-credits-explained/

It sounds like it‚Äôs the total cost of install, (unit + labor). Applies to both personal and business locations. My understanding is that a nema 14-50 outlet does not count, since it‚Äôs just an outlet. 

Given the high labor costs I was tempted to just do the outlet as well, but with the credit, it‚Äôs more or less a free charger.

It will be Form 8911 for all you tax nerds out there, and credit appears to be retroactive back to 2017 as well."
"Where I am, it‚Äôs the runs that matter a lot. Distance to cat6, parallel vs 90 alignment etc"
In some countries
"No shame in knowing when to ask for help. Even if you know what you're doing, sometimes some stuff gets complicated."
This is great and might make me change course. Thanks for this information!
"Oh yea. You mean for interference, right? I was specifically referring to the fire hazard."
Blue looks amazing in pictures. I think it might be my new fav. Prior fav was greY.
Are you happy with the vehicle? How is the quality? Does it make you laugh when you step on it?
But but but panel gaps! /s
"I have a Blue on Black as well picked up earlier this week and these are my comparisons with the 3 - 

* Ride is much more comfortable and you feel like you're on a more solid platform

* Cornering is better on the 3 though as this is higher and you get the sense of loss of balance 

* Y is MUCH more quieter inside than the 3 

* It feels very powerful and quick for a CUV form factor surprisingly

* It is WAY more spacious than the 3. You have a ridiculous amount of storage in the back. Much more than my earlier Acura MDX SUV which was immense. This also has the space under the rear area that is super deep. Space in the hood/front trunk is also immense imo. Especially compared to the 3

* The front trunk closes nicer than the 3. The 3 - you need BOTH hands on each side of the T and have to press down firmly and takes a couple of tries till it ""latches"". On the Y, it latches in much faster and on 1st try more easily. 

* The ability to open and close the trunk via a button is very amazing compared to the 3 which also should've had it

* Rear mirror view on Y is super small compared to the 3. Also the rear mirror seems much darker than the 3

* The panoramic view for passengers in the back is amazing in the Y compared to the 3. It's a world of a difference, especially for kids

* The colors of the car ""feel"" diff on 3 vs Y. e.g. Red looks great on a 3 but looks a bit flamboyish and overdone on the Y. IMO, Blue looks best on the Y and underwhelming on the 3. 

* Wireless charging on the Y was amazing  compared to the earlier 3s."
"And so continues the never-ending swing in my head ""MSM....wait no, blue....no, MSM is better....oh blue is sharp..."""
Who's car would win in a street race? Yours or mine?
When did you place your order? :)
Congrats from another non-pup performance owner! Did you pick up from Tyson‚Äôs or Richmond? Mine came from Tyson‚Äôs!
Where did you install the charger? Is it inside the garage and the cord is just going under the door?
Did service center attach the front license plate? How did they do it?
Tell me exactly how many millimeter is each panel gap.
Your car is nice but I really love your house.
How do your door seals look? Specifically on the bottom of the rear doors?
Beautiful!  Best of luck with it.  Glad your delivery was smooth.
"Looking good, car twin!"
"What is the front clearance? Trying to decide between performance and PUP, but worried the lowered suspension will be too low."
Here is a question: Is it safe to charge in the rain? Is the charge port water proof?
The pictures literally don't do this justice.  Looks WAY better in person.
Blue and MSM can look so different depending on the light. I always mentally battle with those colors because I don‚Äôt know if I will get sick of them.
"It's the BEST vehicle I've ever owned period.  I have no problems with the delivery so I'm convinced that it all depends on your individual 'showroom' and service center.  The Delivery Specialist noted to me that the driver door is SLIGHTLY out of alignment with the passenger door creating a small shelf running front to back.  Still waterproof but annoying.

They offered to fix it prior to me taking possession, but I wanted the car.  So it'll be corrected once I get it back from the PPF job :)

Edit: And yes.... it makes me smile when you hard accelerate. \^\^"
"Terrible shot, but outside the driver door, I haven't seen anything on the car that seriously bothers me.  My Delivery Team tried to adjust everything prior to my delivery.  They were going to deliver on the 22nd, but delivered on the 20th thanks to not having to make many adjustments."
+1 to all of these points.  ESPECIALLY that rear view.  Such a TINY window ^^
I did the same.  Jumped on the blue and was stupidly happy about it :)
When I see MSM I often mistake it for boring black on first glance. Blue is stunning.
Your's because I'm not nearly aggressive enough XD
"Originally, right after the reveal of the Model Y.  Problem was, I swapped my interior from white to black in early march.... so it kinda reset my position in queue O-o."
Tysons too \^\_\^  Great staff there.
"The charger is just running a charger cable under the door with some safety 'crush' padding that it goes under.  Just enough to shield the cable, but not enough to stop the door."
"Yeah they attach it. Didn't look to closely, I think it mounts somewhere underneath"
Need to get it back first.  It's getting PPF and Ceramic coating ^_^
I DO like the house.  The full front porch on a ranch is just nice.
"Only REAL concern I have on the door seals have been on the driver door where the whole door is SLIGHTLY misaligned.  Otherwise my Delivery Specialist at the SC basically pointed out all of them.  

""I'm sure you've been watching YouTube, so let me walk you through this...."" was his first line.  Excellent service."
Yes
"Already answered, but yea.... no problem in the rain here so far.  Even with the L2 adapter."
"Totally safe. No current flows till a secure handshake is done with the vehicle once it is plugged in. 

You can submerge the cable in a bucket of water and I THINK it is still safe to put your hand in the bucket. (Don't really try this though, I'm just speculating based on conversation with the electrician)"
Gdi I want so bad but told myself I‚Äôd wait 2 years. Wish I didn‚Äôt let my wife talk me into a new Acura last year.
Yeah I feel the same way with the flashier colors like blue and red. Will I like it in 5 years.
Thank you! I am taking delivery on a non-PUP performance in MSM/black today or tomorrow. Hopefully it's as great as yours is.
How much do you expect to pay for ppf? I‚Äôm debating doing this and maybe ceramic. I‚Äôm going blue as well but I‚Äôm positive it will be just as hard to keep clean as a black car.
"I picked up in Portland, Oregon, and all my panel gaps were perfect. They had clearly gone over the car at the service center. The paint on bolts for frunk and rear hatch are chipped from the adjustment, but was assured they won't rust."
"Have you driven an S? Took my Y in for service and they gave me an S for the weekend. Talk about a small rear window. Anyway, the rear camera alleviates the need to see back there anyways."
"May I ask why you went with that (which?) charger and not a Tesla one? I‚Äôve never looked at the other ones, can you still get 240 @ 48A? How much was it? I know you were wanting more Y questions, but you did post AMA. üòÉ

Did you opt for FSD (I purchased that today)? 

And the final one, isn‚Äôt it better than any other car you‚Äôve ever driven? I‚Äôve only driven a Model 3 (meaning no other EVs, I have driven many other cars), but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got to feel that way as well!"
"Awesome, have a link for the padding? I have a detached two car garage but I rather keep my motorcycle and kids toys in there haha."
Fair enough
You live on a ranch? How nice! I'm currently listening to my neighbor's A/C outside my window who's a fart smell away. I love sunny So Cal but we are packed like sardines over here. Enjoy an iced tea on that porch for me!
Transfer your lease?
I always owned black or white vehicles. Guess I‚Äôm the same way with phones too haha.
I'll cross my fingers for you \^\_\^
I got full PPF (whole car) window tint and ceramic coating for around $6200.
"I bought a paint touchup kit just because of that, just in case :D Fortunately, there were no chips.  I gave the kit to the Paint-Protection Film company."
"So I have a ChargePoint charger because my roommate has a plug-in that's NOT a tesla and at the time I had a plug in Pacifica Hybrid.  We only get 32A on it but that's OK'ish.  Think the charger ran $499 at the time.

I DID opt for FSD. Haven't really used it, but I have it.  I'll figure out something I guess.

And the last question, yes, it's an amazing car.  I'm Tesla or bust now forever.  Easily beats out my old Camaro and Charger (both v6) for 'fun' factor ^^"
It was just compressible foam padding from Home Depot.  I'll try to dig something up after work.
"Not really on a ranch, but the style of the home is a 'Ranch' style ^^.  Damn me and my quick shorthand!"
My current cars are grey and white. Before that I had black. Safe colors üòÇ. Grey has been my favorite in terms of not showing dirt though. Black I swore off because it always looked dirty however I didn‚Äôt have a garage at the time so not sure how it would be now. Black does look pretty when it‚Äôs clean.
You have lots of $$$
"Thanks for the info. Yeah, I still need to test out FSD more, but now I am just impatiently waiting for the latest software update. Grrr.

Fun that your roomie is also an EV person. Are they a bit envious? :-D"
Ahh I thought it was a custom thing just for this application. Cool.
"Agreed with all of that. White stays super clean too, specifically pearl white."
"That's pretty much all I have left XD.  I budgeted for this including an accessory slush fund and lived on instant ramen for way too long.

THAT said, $1500 to $2000 will get you a front wrap and rocker panel cover in most places. Thats where MOST of the PPF is needed."
Not just a BIT but a LOT!  they're on the verge of ordering a model 3 as we speak.  Just wanted to wait till the weekend before pulling the trigger.
My main problem with white is I hate washing my white car. I can very clearly see the dirt which would require a clay to correct and I don‚Äôt have time to detail my car. You can‚Äôt notice from a distance but to me I just see dirt everywhere. I think it‚Äôs just my ocd. My grey car hides it... ignorance is bliss I guess.
Just tell them some other random dude on the internet approves and said ‚Äúpull that trigger!‚Äù
"I‚Äôve found a really good hand wash place by me. I usually do every other week :)

I had a mobile service that would come weekly, but I wasn‚Äôt happy with the work."
I'll be sure to show him this comment when he gets off work today XD
Went out for another impatient check on the software update. It‚Äôs downloading 2020.24.6.1 now. :-) You may have to wait. Do you know what version your car is currently at? There‚Äôs some nice updates in this one. The car only gets better!
Awesome angle for this pic. Black really looks great! Hope you can keep it great haha.
"A few photos including all the issues I found:

[https://imgur.com/a/VjUCHyj](https://imgur.com/a/VjUCHyj)

So far:

1. Charge door does not close flush
2. Spoiler has not adhered on the left side
3. One of the back seats sits higher than the others, rattles a tiny bit
4. Driver's side door creaks a bit when the car goes over bumps
5. Only two or three minor alignment issues that I barely noticed and I don't think they'll fix

Pretty awesome!

I picked it up in San Francisco this morning. Delivery manager said this is only the second black Model Y they've seen, and the first one was just sitting across the room waiting to be picked up.

I got there a bit early, the building is old and seems to be hacked together for delivery. The front doors were shut, no signs. I walked around the block, and asked someone who was washing a Model 3 outside. He opened a random garage door and there were people there waiting for me. Not sure how else I would've gotten in.

Touchless delivery was fairly easy, I got 30 minutes to look at the car, then I had to sign paperwork. They weren't pushy, they were very nice!

I didn't see any issues when I was there. It was pretty great, and I guess I expected worse.

When I got home, I really had to go through the entire car carefully a few times to find a couple small things. The most notable being the charge door not closing flush, and the back seat not aligned.

My only issue now is, the garage apparently doesn't have sufficient grounding to charge the car (it's old). No biggie, I need to get a 220v out there eventually anyway.

My current problems:

1. My phone doesn't stay on the charging pad, it slides right off and down into the bin below. What is going on? I don't have a phone case.
2. The car brakes like a MF when I take my foot off the gas. I was getting myself carsick (and that never happens) because of the forward lurching. Yeah, I've only driven a Tesla once in my life, and I remember it being uncomfortable. So far, it's kind of not a great drive because of this. I keep hearing I need to get used to it. I came from driving manual cars with clutches my entire life, I can barely drive an automatic transmission car, so this is REALLY weird.
3. Charging... I guess I will be doing a lot of Caraoke until I can setup the house with 220v, or at least get the garage grounded correctly.
4. In order to keep the hatch from hitting the garage ceiling, I had to set it just below 82"". That doesn't give a lot of space to get into the hatch. I think that's kind of annoying, but I get it. Maybe I just need a new garage.
5. Center console - the finger prints are driving me nuts"
Enjoy your new MY.  It's gorgeous!
LOVE THIS. so jealous. Ordered on June 1. Guessing a few months out
I have a black MY that I have been waiting on for a year. This give me hope!
Roughly what is your vin?
So will they fix the headlight issue or the charger port?
"Awesome thanks for the review! I'm picking up a black lr awd on the 26th. Congratulations

Also I thought you could set the regenerative breaking to low. Maybe that will help until ready for standard? 

Per manual:

To Set the Regenerative Braking Level
You can use the touchscreen to change the
level of regenerative braking:
1. Touch Controls > Driving > Regenerative
Braking.
2. Choose from two levels:

‚Ä¢ Standard: Provides the maximum
amount of regenerative braking. When
you release the accelerator, Model Y
slows down, reducing the need to use
the brakes.

‚Ä¢ Low: Limits regenerative braking.
When you release the accelerator,
Model Y takes longer to slow down
and coasts further than if set to
""Standard""."
What does PUP mean?
Thanks. I‚Äôve only had black cars since I could drive. So I don‚Äôt know any other way to take care of a car (tons of washing).
"On the driving part, you simply don‚Äôt take your foot all the way off the accelerator. Your foot sets the speed at all times. It is the smoothest driving experience ever once you get good at it. I came from a manual and found it incredibly intuitive."
"It takes some time to nail down the slow release for smooth one pedal driving, but you'll get there in a few days."
"> One of the back seats sits higher than the others, rattles a tiny bit

This seems to be a v common issue for some reason - and there's no fix currently available for it."
"Should be 4 to 8 weeks, I bet there‚Äôs a chance they could try to sneak yours in by June 30 if you have all the paperwork info ready"
What parts of the VIN are safe to share publically?
"I just put in the service request. Not sure yet. The gap is pretty small. I can barely tell, so it‚Äôs not a biggie if they don‚Äôt."
"Oh nice, I actually chose ""ROLL"" instead of ""HOLD,"" but I don't think that's the right setting. I'll try the regen to Low. But maybe I should just get used to the standard one."
Performance upgrade package.
Same.
"Yeah, on a 30 minute drive, I started getting used to it, then forgot when I approached a corner and had quite a head jerk."
"Thanks, that's good to know!"
Yeah I saw a few YouTube videos about it.
Last 6. Just trying to figure out how far into production yours is
Thanks
"I think if you're not used to having a black car, owning one is really weird. But I don't know, it's just been part of owning a car, keeping it clean.

On my last car, it was fully wrapped in XPEL, and I would use one of those big car dusters on it every time I came home, and sometimes right before leaving the garage. And of course, garage. And then it's just fine. The duster was a game changer, and having a single car garage makes it even easier."
"If it bothers you that much you can toggle the regenerative braking to low, but you‚Äôll sacrifice battery recharging opportunity

Edit: looks like someone mentioned this further down"
012xxx
"Oh and the other thing, I have an 8HP drier that blasts water off. I also use detail spray after drying to get rid of any last water residue."
"Yeah just saw that. I‚Äôll try it, but most likely going to try to learn to love the regen braking."
Jesus! That is a helluva regimen! I have a Prius. It gets two washes a year üòÇ
"Hah! Well here's how it usually goes:  


1. Park in the garage.
2. Grab the duster from the wall
3. Just go over the surface quickly. Takes one minute, maybe 2.

When I leave

1. Goto the garage
2. Grab the duster
3. Just go over the surface (1 - 2 minutes)
4. Put the duster back and leave

It's just a few more minutes before and after driving.

Washing a car, it's just simple rinse, soap, and dry with the 8hp drier, which is really simple. If it's really hot outside, the water droplets will leave residue, so I just go over some of those areas with a detail spray, wipe off with a cloth, and it's good."
I admire your regimen! The Prius is our workhorse so it transports kids and dogs!
"I heard duster is really bad for paint/ppf, what was your experience with it?"
"I used it on my Audi for 5 years, looked brand new when I sold it."
This is a rare bird! Black exterior and white interior haven‚Äôt been released as readily. Very nice!
Exactly what I wanna getüòçcongrats!
Damn it really looks great in black and white.
"Looks fantastic!

Im getting the opposite because i‚Äôm too lazy to clean. Easier to maintain white exterior and black interior."
Niiiice!  Congrats!
Nice
nice-looking oreo
"Ahh, my car's (Model 3) chunky cousin!"
congrats! i am so excited to see this config made! lookes beautiful
interior pics! now now now
I currently have a white on white model x and thinking of getting a black on white model y. Is it really hard to keep that black looking clean?
Album pleeeeeeease
Fantastic car!
Every car I have had is white on black but I just couldn't resist this look...
"having own the white interior for my model 3, it's so much easier to keep clean than I even thought."
Congrats. The customer service concerns me. That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt pull the trigger and got one yet.
More pics please :)
"Had a crazy good pickup experience in my neck of the woods.  At the beginning of COVID and ""touchless"".  They still came out and walked me through everything at a distance and posed joined in on a Selfie.  Sorry to hear it wasn't the best, the experience in the car will definitely make up for it."
Dope color! I have same with white interior!
did the front plate holder come already mounted? mine was in the trunk when i picked up at fremont. i read that they mount that to hide blemishes but not sure if true.
I picked up at Costa Mesa and had excellent customer service. The guy gave me time to look over the car and asked if there were any problems to note down.
"Very cool, congrats!  Seems that customer service varies by location, hopefully ownership goes much better!"
"Happy for you, bud!"
I picked up the same last Saturday and just got it back from PPF and tint yesterday- love it! Former model 3 owner here and can say the Y is much better! As for customer service mine was fine but keep it in perspective - once you get your car you‚Äôll rarely interact with them. And the joy of ownership makes you forget everything else! üòÅüòÅ
"Picked mine up yesterday, one sort of tacky issue in the driver side seat base where two sections of carpet meet, otherwise fit and finish are fine so far. The customer service was meh.. Not awful, the woman was nice enough but for a luxury brand you expect and are paying for better than okay.

I do feel that there's a general feeling of, you're getting an amazing car, you should just be happy about it and oh, I've got other things to do.

For, the most part the customer service side isn't a huge issue today. No one likes paying $60k and being treated like you just bought some cookies at Wal Mart, but most current Tesla buyers have done their research know what the car is about. In a year or two, when traditional luxury dealers are delivering their cars they will be going overboard in the experience department. I've said before the silicon Valley influence of Tesla means there probably isn't a focus on relationship building in the sales/service/delivery folks.

Mostly its okay. I don't have to have people catering to my whim and trying to impress me all the time. But, I mean who wouldn't want a little more of that"
They literally gave me the keys and said there is your car. In order to ask questions I had to call a number and keep asking them to come outside.
I concur! Have kids otherwise would of went with white interior.
Do you have pictures you could share?
"Yes mine was mounted, I guess I will check behind it..."
"Was your front plate mounted? I don‚Äôt want them to drill the holes, I don‚Äôt plan on putting front plates on."
"What a shit experience. I got a text from them yesterday asking if I want delivery in June or if not to tell them another month. Stories like this make me hesitant to lay down almost 60k. Never mind all the stories of gap, paint, and other misc issues. Ugh. Don't know what to do."
I have a toddler. Really worried about how the white interior will hold up :D
"My VIN isn't assigned yet, probably coz its white interior. Ordered in November 2019 :("
"It has two strips of tape , I pulled it off on a warm sunny day , here in oc"
I am picking mine up at Costa Mesa service center too! Although I do not want them to mount the plate. I wonder who I need to contact?!
"Yes, it was mounted. I don't think Tesla's front plates need to be drilled on, I think they use tape."
Keep in mind humans are more likely to discuss bad experiences than good experiences. I believe Bloomberg did a survey of test the owners a year ago and most people had excellent experiences.
"I checked out other Tesla owners with kids/toddlers and white interior, and they said it was fairly easy to clean. One had two teslas, black and white interior and he says it is as easy to clean for both"
Did you pick it up in Costa Mesa?
Do you think I‚Äôll be able to ask them not to ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"yes, but it was home delivery 4/1 during shutdown, so naturally several paint and panel issues, but are 99% resolved, the rest I will just live with it"
"Legally you have to have a front license plate in California, so they probably have to do it."
Did you ask for a replacement VIN? That paint is a joke.
Lol whose painting these things
"okay, I'm canceling, enough is enough..."
Tweet Elon if you haven't already. This is embarrassing.
It‚Äôs a Tesla thing. You wouldn‚Äôt understand. /s
Where is this. Pretty sure they‚Äôll try to sell this to another sucker.
That paint is outrageous
"Thanks for posting this, as I have been on the fence about taking a delivery soon. I‚Äôve seen too many issues with the white door mismatch, but not any with other paint colors? Maybe harder to tell with darker paint?"
Are the 2020 Model X's like this with bad QC too?
It almost looks blu-ish. What was the vin #
I cancelled delivery and told them I'd try again in July after the quarter-end rush is over.  The VIN on it was 18xxx.
Oh man.  That sucks.  Sorry you had to deal with such poor QC.
That‚Äôs fucking ridiculous....I‚Äôd be so disappointed  man
I can understand bad QC for less obvious things but how do the door paint mismatches keep happening!
Wow I feel for you on this one. sneak in a full paint job.
"Sorry, from one photo it's hard to tell if there is really a color problem.  It's subtle. 

For example, in the reflection on that door it looks like there is a tree and the tree may be blocking out the light hitting the door and the perception is that the color is different.

Yet, I will have to give the OP the benefit of the doubt.  I hope Tesla fixes any problems like this."
never buy the white one they all have problems
It looks like the door had to be replaced tbh
So he can play this shitty lottery again? Lol
Robots
He knows.  This is a very common problem for white.
"Have you driven one though!!?

:-)"
"I don't think the X has ever been ""good"", even if they're not as bad as the Y.

I think the only one is not have reservations about is the S."
"All I will say is if you're picking up a white on white, LR AWD with inductions in Santa Barbara, take a close look at it -- especially the rear passenger door."

This is not just my opinion. This picture was posed in the thread below and multiple people did not know what was wrong because they were not prompted to look at the rear door.

"Very true, not a bad way to keep the pressure on him"
Yawn. You are very obviously being deliberately obtuse.
Wait do you have 2? What‚Äôs in the garage?
"That looks great!  I‚Äôm so glad I took delivery yesterday because if you posted that a week or two ago I would have switched my color (again.. lol)

Congrats on your MY, lots of luck with her!"
"Very sexy, congrats. The all black makes me want to change my order but instead I ordered an additional one, black/black with 20"" just now, let's see which arrives sooner, the black on black or the white on white from Feb both 20"" wheels."
That‚Äôs a beautiful car.
"That looks absolutely amazing. If I had one, I would consider getting the windows tinted, and get a full car ceramic coating to complete a shining all black look."
Looks like an official car - like a SWAT Police car or a Military car
"I delayed mine for the 7 seater, but I‚Äôm changing my mind. I just can‚Äôt see sitting 2 more people in the back. What do you guys think?"
"Damnnnnnnn

That looks great.

Didn't get my Model 3 in Black because of always needing to be clean but this has me considering a Black Y PUP."
"Dannng looking nice. Thanks for the upload. I‚Äôm looking to get a black exterior too. Do you notice any significant gaps or swirls in the fit and finish? I don‚Äôt really care about small minor ones 

Thanks !"
The one in the Garage is my Friend‚Äôs who also took delivery of his Y with me. Identical config as mine.
"I don‚Äôt think there is enough space in the back for 2 people to sit comfortably. If you have a small child, then it might be useful but not worth extra $$ and wait IMO."
No way the Y seats 7 Gronks.
"The two extra seats are ‚Äúnice‚Äù to have even though it won‚Äôt be comfortable but have you seen a rear end accident of a model Y? Doesn‚Äôt look good and the worst part is you have no control over someone deciding to ram into you. The model 3 has that rear support bar but the model Y clearly won‚Äôt.

If you‚Äôll be using the extra seats very often it‚Äôs probably better to get a larger vehicle."
\#twinsies
So how do we know the one in the garage isn‚Äôt yours? ü§î
Thanks guys. I thought it would be bigger but I just saw one in real life and was like... wow. That‚Äôs just a little bigger than a 3.
"Ordered on 1/3/20 and delivered on 6/25/20. VIN 13xxx, 06/20 manufacture date.

4 Issues: Real door panel alignment. Sand/dust in paint in the inner door trim. 2 tiny paint chips. And the inside needs to be detailed again (dirty headliner and scuffs in the plastic panels). 

Overall I'm very happy with the car. Immediately sent 22 pictures documenting the 4 issues to Tesla and scheduled a service appointment in early July to get them addressed. 

Top priority item was to get the windows tinted. I sent the car off to a shop in Costa Mesa, CA who did a great job. 35% on the front (Suntek ceramic) and 50% on the sunroof (3M nano-ceramic). Next up is vinyl wrapping the center console."
Any paint mismatch issues?
Tinting the too doesn‚Äôt allow it to change color when it rains right
"While I‚Äôm not much of a white car guy, I e been tempted with the factory storm trooper look. This looks really nice, can you post more pictures (especially with the 20‚Äù wheels visible)?"
Is your sunroof tint darker than the stock tint? Does this help keep the car cooler?
"None for me. My delivery was in a parking garage, so lighting wasn't great. But, I sweet talked the delivery advisors into letting me drive it up 1 level to the roof. Spent about 30 minutes going through the checklist and 15 of that was looking at the paint from every angle. For good measure, I took pictures on my phone and looked at them to triple confirm that it looks good via photo too. 

I asked my tint guy to see if he noticed anything (he does clear bras too) and he said the color looked solid. He did say he's seen a couple poorly built MY and M3's recently though and mine was pretty good comparably."
That I'm not sure about. The tint is on the inside as opposed to the outside so I assume it would have no effect?
"Sunroof and rear windows are factory tinted at about 25%. But, it doesn't block heat that well. On the drive home after my delivery, I was getting pretty hot and could feel the heat. Thus, I went with a 50% 3M nano-ceramic on top. It doesn't darken the stock tint much. If you're worried about that, you could do a 70%. It does help keep the car significantly cooler."
Congrats! Looks great
That‚Äôs an awesome idea. Haven‚Äôt heard of anyone doing that. Any benefit? Did you add anything on top of factory dark glass? I‚Äôm in Florida and have a new born and sun comes on her face from top and side. Also debating doing a cover vs tint. Maybe both. What‚Äôs your thoughts?
Is there a reason so you didn‚Äôt do ceramic on the rear windows? Did you do ceramic on the trunk window?
As far as I know they always apply tint to the inside and not the outside. I have a baby on the way so we opted to tint AND buy a sunshade from Tesmanian. I've seen several people tint the factory tinted glass with ceramic for max heat and UV deflection.
Tint almost exclusively goes on the inside for cars.
"I didn't do ceramic on the rear and trunk windows. From a heat/UV/IR perspective, I wanted to deflect from the top as well as the front seats. I may go back and do the windshield though."
I realized this after I said what I did lol
What issues are you having exactly? I‚Äôm expecting my ‚ÄúMY‚Äù to be delivered in the next couple weeks. What to make sure I‚Äôm looking for the right things.
"heres a tip for new tesla owners: trying to fix every little problem will cause more problems. It's a car not a museum piece. Any paint spec you find and make them fix will soon be cancelled out by a pebble on the freeway. Take care of the big issues, and then enjoy the car."
I sent them enough photos and issues to have them cancel the mobile-service and make me go to the service center instead.
I assembled a MY delivery checklist here: https://github.com/polymorphic/tesla-model-y-checklist
Surgeons consult YouTube too.
"Driver side door is a couple mm off from rest of the car, and then just had an issue with the rear passenger tail light side reflector concaved. They could not adjust the door since it was the entire door so have to go to the service center to repair. They fixed the tail light but accidentally broke the clip securing the side reflector so that has to be fixed as well. They were kind and courtesy but I know Tesla will fix timely so no issues. Otherwise I haven't had any issues with fit and finish as I've heard from others"
Did you happen to use a referral code yet?üòÖ
"It seems like now Tesla has a reputation for build issues which leads to new owners being even more critical than they otherwise would. The only way for Tesla to fix it is to increase their QC so these issues don‚Äôt happen and more people report receiving perfect vehicles.

I do wonder how many of the people having issues think the build quality issues outweigh the positive aspects of the car."
">	trying to fix every little problem will cause more problems

It‚Äôs $60k. There shouldn‚Äôt be little problems."
"Mine didn‚Äôt even give me a mobile option, I have an appointment in a week and a half. Some scratches on the outside, scratches on the inside door trim, and weird ‚Äúdents‚Äù in the back seat."
Thanks!
"That is SO true. I make medical equipment. When I ask my users where they look for information, the general answer sequence is 

1. Sales rep
2. YouTube
3. Everything else
4. The operator‚Äôs manual"
"My wife's neurologist once suggested a medication, then looked it up on her phone and was like ""Oh, never mind, we're going to try something else"". A little awkward, but Id rather they get it right the first time. Doesnt matter if its a doctor, surgeon, mechanic, or the plumber. Sometimes part of being an ""expert"" is knowing what questions to ask, and where to look for the information."
Tesla was not accepting referral codes on the Y when I ordered.
"Tesla has to build this with whatever cheap labor they can scrap together in a leftover Toyota factory in northern California, where there is no cheap labor. So don't expect Lexus fix and finish. Someday when they can properly build their own factory in a part of the country with cheaper labor, you'll see a major improvement in quality. In the meantime anyone buying a Tesla for fit and finish is going to be dissappointed, but you didn't pay 60k for the paint, you paid for the smile on your face from the instant torque every time your right foot moves. If you want some nice fit and finish, figure out how to smuggle one in from Shanghai factory."
"Have owned benz BMW and Lexus in that price range, all have little problems. There is nothing perfect in this world. Btw 60k not that much money"
Definitely. I'm suspicious of anyone who claims to have all of the answers.
You could probably still ask if you could use a code if you haven‚Äôt taken delivery yet
"If you are paying for a 60k+ car then it is not unreasonable to expect that the quality is at least on par with a car half the price in all aspects including paint, fit, and finish. They droped the ball with the initial MY production and people who made their purchase early have the right to request that Tesla fixes these issues and hold them accountable. Tesla doesn't get a free pass just because Elon Musk is a pretty cool guy.

Tesla is a young car manufacturer and these issues are part of the learning process for them, but telling people to just accept it, turn a blind eye, and not request service for anything they feel is not up to the standard a 60k+ should be is not the correct answer."
"I mean, I agree with the general premise, but not right off the bat. 

Yes, don‚Äôt stress normal wear and tear *as it happens*, but if you‚Äôre paying that much for the car, it shouldn‚Äôt roll off the lot looking like you‚Äôve been driving it for 6 months. There shouldn‚Äôt be paint issues."
"Exactly. People are talking about the Model Y like it's a $150k vehicle. It's not. Yes it's expensive relative to what most people would be willing/able to spend on a car, but it's not expensive in the world of cars."
"I did that already. See response below.  I‚Äôm not one to make a fuss, so I just accepted that they aren‚Äôt willing to apply the referral retroactively. 

 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid we cannot apply referral codes to Y orders placed before June 9th (see ‚Äòlimits‚Äô section): https://www.tesla.com/support/referral-program
 
But for what it‚Äôs worth, a sincere thank you to Travis for helping inspire you to join the electric revolution!!
 
Please let me know if any other questions come up. All the best and we‚Äôll be in touch!
-Henry‚Äù"
"Im warning them it's a slippery slope, you'll be trading in panel gaps for paint scratches, seat alignment for dirty headliners. That's the level Tesla is at now. The enemy of good is perfect."
"When I got my bmw 3 series in 2012 half the tail light popped out. Did I go nuts about it? Nope, double sided tape shoved it back looked pretty good and went on with my life. Some people just suffer from ocd and I feel for the Tesla person that has to deal with that type of personalities day in day out."
"Yup and even the 150k vehicles have small issues. Also, I don't think the high end BMWs are built any better than a high end Hyundai and they fall apart much sooner. With the German brands you pay for the badge, not quality. At least with Tesla you pay for another level of technology."
"If it was a new car I would‚Äôve definitely complained about that, as would most people"
"And they would have double sided taped it for me, and it would have cost me half a day of fussing. Life is short, i worry about the big problems, I don't get caught up on I spent 55k on this BMW and boy I'm so mad the tail light harness broke."
Did you try turning it off and back on again?
"So, I picked up my Model Y last Saturday and it had a few minor issues that I was told to take pictures of and put into the app: 3-4 small trim issues, small tear in console panel leather, scratches on driver door handle, slight panel gap on front fender. Nothing that made me want to refuse delivery. 
Last night I went out to the garage and saw this screen with a bunch of warnings. I tried using both the screen controls and the app but couldn‚Äôt get it to release from the Tesla wall charger in my garage. I tried resetting it by pushing both buttons on the steering wheel and also shutting it down through the menu, neither would release the charger. 
We called Tesla and they said they would send out a Tesla approved tow truck to jump the Tesla so we could release it from the wall and then tow it to the service center to see what was up. Tow truck driver showed up and said this was his 8th Tesla of the day with this issue. He tried to jump it and was able to get the frunk open but was unable to get it to release the charger from the wall. He also had to borrow my tools to use on the battery cables since he ‚Äúforgot‚Äù his. At this point it was about 11:30 and he basically gave up. 
We called Tesla back and they are supposed to send someone out to the house this morning at 10 to see what they need to do. Meanwhile I have to be at work today so my wife is going to stay home for the service appointment while I take her car. 
All around pretty lame experience last night. The car drove and performed perfectly all week and I‚Äôm hoping this will be an easy fix and that Tesla will fix all the issues that I‚Äôve reported through the app but they did postpone my appointment to fix the original issues by 2 weeks. If there‚Äôs a silver lining at least this happened in my garage and not somewhere random."
Oh no.. please let us know what Tesla says happened.
"this happened in my model 3 and is extremely rare if it is what it looks like  


they fixed me up for free and put me in a loaner P100D Model S for the two weeks it took Old Dominion to get a new pack to them(they gave me the tracking so I could see where it was), supercharging was on the house in that car  


they were professional, courteous, kept me up to date and did great work  


Ultimately I decided to trade it in and get a Y, which has been great. Early failure on electronics is sadly common, and I would personally much rather have it fail early, in the garage, under warranty, than 8 years down the road the day I'm out of warranty.  


I really hope they get it fixed fast and this becomes a mere memory"
Like most electronics they break early or last forever
"Oh God. 6 days to pick up and the excitement is gone. This sucks bc getting a new car is always exciting, but Tesla‚Äôs poor QC kills the moment!"
Wouldn't be surprised if it was a loose ground terminal on your 12V battery. Might be something you can check on.
Looks like a DOA 12v battery
This sucks and sorry to hear.  This report and all of the many reports about higher than normal Tesla quality issues on the Y has me on the fence.
Sucks but you‚Äôll be up in no time. No sweat
At least you were home üíÅ
Just want to throw this out there that I picked up my Model Y on March 23rd vin 10xx and it has been great for the 2700 miles I have driven it. Knock on wood it last me a long time because I plan to keep it a long time. Just wanted to add a positive note to those of you waiting to get yours
"It makes me wanna wait another month before I accept the delivery. Rejected first one on Saturday, because of the horrible paint job (different shades of white on the driver side doors) ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Oh no. You didn't press the red button did you?
"I wonder what in the battery broke? Or it's the charge port? Either way, if anyone is planning on buying a Model Y just wait till this time next year."
"Yep, more than once. Eventually it just went dark and didn‚Äôt come back on again."
Update 3pm: Tech came out and replaced the 12v battery and discovered it was still having an issue and found that there was a short. He fixed the short and then fixed a few items from my original list. Confidence relatively restored but still made for a frustrating evening yesterday. They still are waiting for a new door handle and a couple of other things to do but that should all be fixed in the next couple of weeks. For now I‚Äôm happy my Model Y is alive again.
Can't you just pull the manual release to unlock the charge port?
‚ÄúBut have you been enjoying the fart sounds?‚Äù
Right?! I'm actually dreading my pick up tomorrow since we all have to examine the whole car.
I am picking mine over the weekend too. Let's hope it will be a good one rather than a cursed one.
"Yes, I'm feeling the same."
Was that the one marked ‚Äúself destruct‚Äù? Maybe...
I talked with 2 different Tesla reps and also the ‚ÄúTesla‚Äù Tow Truck guy and no one mentioned using the manual release. I don‚Äôt know if that was an oversight on their part but I just followed their instructions.
Where is that?
So many fart sounds. That‚Äôs my son‚Äôs 2nd favorite part of the car after the racing game.
"I think we are dreading the thought that we find so many things wrong that we would have to reject the vehicle. Sorry, I‚Äôve been through so many cars I never had to go in with a checklist of known issues. You don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs something wrong with that? Shit! A bullshit Corolla for 20k you don‚Äôt have to worry about a thing. Here we have a $63plus K car and we have to worry about paint, panels, leaks, gaps, seat alignment, etc, etc. For $63plus k the only thing I want to know is if I have enough fuel (power) to get home."
"was supposed to take delivery today, really hurt me to postpone.  don't want to be spending 1+ hours combing and then dealing with service."
Well maybe they know something I don't. If you can get in the trunk you should be able to access the manual release.
Read the manual. Page 155.
"Ah, you know what. That‚Äôs what it is. Max 2 pumps. Yellow flag."
Why did you postpone?
Didn't want to have to go through the car with a fine tooth comb and then dealing with subsequent service.  My 2019 X has had 0 issues/problems and I'd like them to get quality to a point where I don't have to worry about taking delivery.
Any problems?
That‚Äôs my same configuration. Hopefully picking mine up soon! What city are you in?
"Same as us. Owned for 10 days now. 

Have them come out and fix that fender by the front driver headlight. Looks like it isn‚Äôt quite tucked in. 

Source: have the same issue on the passenger side of our car, but a little worse."
Same configuration but with the induction wheels. Any other issues with the car. So many threads with issues has me concerned but I am optimistic.
Same configuration. I‚Äôm gonna pick up mine on coming Wednesday. I can‚Äôt wait
Congrats and best of luck with it!  Looks really nice!
"Picked it up in Paramus, NJ."
I have the same fender corner sticking out issue on both sides. My car is in the shop now but the service advisor wasn‚Äôt sure if that is fixable. Was yours fixed? I‚Äôm thinking it might depend on the advisor/tech...
"They are out here on the 16th. 

I‚Äôll let you know."

That white interior is sleek!
We both got one!
Amazing unicorn!
Gorgeous. Look forward to seeing you around the city!
"It‚Äôs so amazing! Getting on the freeway today, a Sentra was on my tail trying to get around me...I let it go and flew by. OMG, was at 100 mph and didn‚Äôt even realize it!!!"
Love this mix very much-
Promise to wave! Haven‚Äôt seen any other Y‚Äôs in town yet!!
"Oh I've seen a handful, but I work across the street from SD Wrap/Elite Finish where several have come by already. You'd be the first black one though."
"Got this one from Tesla: https://shop.tesla.com/en_ca/product/cable-organizer

I recommend it. The other options don't have a solution for the heavy ""brick"" like this one does."
"Cool, looks clean. 

I wish they had a retractable one, always liked that about the ChargePoint stations."
Looks nice. Just added it to my list of things to get. Thanks for sharing!
"If you have a 3D printer, there are similar designs on Thingiverse"
"I printed a similar one for $1.50 in PETG. Not quite as snazzy but hey, saved me some bones.

Also, I see 50% of people hang the tesla charger up, and 50% down. Is there a right way? I installed my plug to hang ""down"", but I have plenty of wire to flip it if there is a technical reason for up vs down. Or is this like the toilet paper direction debate."
"Use big loops, much easier to take off one loop to plug in and hang it back up."
Nice but your outlet is installed upside down! Ground pin on top in case anything falls on it and dislodges it (at least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm told).
What is your amp and how fast can you charge with that thing?
Dang that‚Äôs how you use that piece huh?
"I had never noticed the brick holder since they almost always go down from the outlet, that is cool!"
You can actually buy that retractable cable.
"Nice! If I could 3D print, I definitely would. I actually think mine should be the other way around...but not sure if it hurts anything. The Tesla website shows the brick both above and below the outlet."
good call. i'm gonna stretch it out so it loosens up a bit. it's still used to the tight coil in the carrying case.
240V and charges at 32 amps. Charges about 25-30 mi/hr.
"Yeah mine is installed differently. If the brick went downward, I could probably get away with a normal hook"
Anyone got a 3D print option for this?
"I made this one.  Works ok.

Nice. Interesting the number count is the same as the curb weight of the car.
Banana for scale?
Lol that is interesting
THANK YOU. Been googling like crazy for a picture too!
I think this might be the first ever black Model Y with induction wheels delivered!!! I have only seen Black with the PUP
They do exist! Can‚Äôt wait for mine.
"Yes! Ordered the exact same one, can‚Äôt wait!"
Love the all black. I‚Äôve never had a black car (always hear nightmares about keeping it clean) but this makes me want one!
Wow.  An actual delivery with induction wheels.  Looks as good as I hoped.  That is one lucky man.  I'm beyond jealous but happy the unicorn is finally released into the wild where it belongs!
That looks amazing!  Just wired the payment for mine. Fingers crossed it‚Äôs here this week!
Can you still find the handles? üòõ
Looks sharp. I like the wheels a lot
Someone got a black PUP delivered? Any links?
When did you order? 20‚Äù?

"Ive been really fortunate I think, ordered 5/13, VIN 6/4, delivery hopefully this week. I did get the 20‚Äù wheels, but should have clarified that mine is white. Does seem like there have been lots more whites being delivered."
"Yeah, I saw that, but didn't think it was delivered yet. But it sure does look good."
"WTF -- this is my exact config! Ordered 5/18 White/White with 20"" wheels and FSD. Did you get white or black interior?"
I‚Äôve gotten 2 delivery notifications for a white MY with induction wheels and FSD.  The second was yesterday.  Had to push to July though...
"Black interior...seems like the white has been holding folks up. I‚Äôd love a white interior, but I have an 8 year old and a 10 year old.  It would be ketchup colored in minutes!"
"More pics here -[ https://imgur.com/gallery/C74UqZl](https://imgur.com/gallery/C74UqZl)

Super happy with the end result. Had a few blue accents added - I like how they turned out so I'm planning on doing the handles and side cameras as well.

Heading on a 1300 mile road trip next week!"
Nice!
Love the contrast of the white and black wheels! Red rocks?
"Wow that looks fantastic!!! 

What‚Äôs a ballpark cost range on something like that? Trying to decide if I want to do that with mine when it gets here."
Did you get the emblems popped off and painted or is that vinyl?
I heard you really have to highly tint the white interior cars. What percent did you put on the front and windshield? Any problem with visibility in either?
Also any pics with the doors open to see the white interior with white exterior?
"Which shop did you get the XPEL done at (in Colorado). Looks great, thanks!"
Looks great! How‚Äôs it in the shade? I read on bright days it looks great but darker days brings out the bumpers different shade of white more.
"The blue is subtle and gorgeous, I‚Äôm taken aback. Will appreciate any more pics, esp of the back."
"Yep - Red Rocks in Morrison, CO"
Yea - just north of $8000 including full tint (with windshield)
"I was quoted $6500 when I was looking into it

I ultimately decided not to because you can repaint the whole car for less"
It's vinyl - had them taken off and wrapped.
Yep - I'm in Colorado so TONS of sun here. Did a 15% tint on the sides. The front is a clear tint - no visibility issues.
What‚Äôs the reason the white interior needs high tint?
Here are a few pics of the inside (taken pre-xpel wrap) - http://imgur.com/gallery/LMRwDuG
"Thanks! Fortunately, I don't have the bumper color issue - the white is very consistent throughout so I don't notice any difference in the shade. :)"
Thanks. Looks phenomenal!
"I was just quoted $3,600 in NYC."
"Even in dark tint, people can see your bright white leather seats. It looks like you barely have any tint on. But with black seats, the tint covers em up easily"
Wow looks amazing
That‚Äôs great to hear! I‚Äôm new to tesla and will be taking delivery in a couple of weeks and reddit seems to be full of horror stories about the white(purchased white as well). It‚Äôs refreshing to see someone actually happy with it.

"I should be getting my red MY tomorrow... Wish me luck they don't miss the initial delivery date!
So excited!"
"I just realized why the Red looks better on the S and 3. It's because of the awesome silver/chrome finish. It makes the red stand out. 

The black look is not as striking as the chrome finish. 

On the Y the black finish seems ok because of its larger size perhaps"
Thanks man. We are really happy with it.
All the details that were thought through are amazing. I love the regen braking. I got used to it immediately. The fact that I have an iPhone on wheels amazes me. The fact that I‚Äôm refueling my car in my own garage blows my mind. I can‚Äôt wait for the cybertruck to come out.
Thank you.
Good Luck. The car is awesome.
"Respectfully, I entirely disagree. Red/Black looks amazing."
Today an early Model S parked in front of my MY ... it looked dated. Shoulda taken a photo.
"Just check out the photo on Tesla website with Model S configurator. 

The Red with chrome looks amazing."
"Is Tesla‚Äôs Model Y Crossover  the World‚Äôs Best Car?

After years of extravagant R&D, the Silicon Valley car maker has accumulated a pile of patents and a mountain of innovations. No wonder the Model Y is years ahead of the competition, says Dan Neil.

I WAS DEBATING¬†whether to proclaim the new Tesla Model Y the best car in the world. Given that the all-electric medium-size crossover ($57,190 for the Long Range Dual Motor AWD, as tested) is the most technically advanced electric automobile made; and that electric cars are functionally superior to those powered by internal combustion; there is a certain Vulcan logic to it.

Reasonable earthlings may disagree. This high-waisted version of the Model 3 sedan‚Äîwith roughly 70% of the same parts, says the company‚Äîisn‚Äôt exactly lovely, a quality every tiara-wearing total package ought to have, don‚Äôt you think? The Y is 7.1 inches taller (+1.1 inch ground clearance) than the 3, a couple inches longer and nearly 3 inches wider. Under the liftback (very like a Model X) is about 53 cubic feet of storage, with another 15 or so in the front trunk. If the 3 is a cute short stack of pancakes, the Y is the pile they serve you at Denny‚Äôs."
"I love mine. Already have 5,500 miles on it. Has been perfect for me."
Going to test drive both the Y and 3 on Sunday. Cannot wait to compare them essentially side by side.
Best car ever
"I think it could at least one end up as of the best EVs. The crossover is immensely popular, and Tesla has made the first real EV crossover in the Model Y. It‚Äôs too early for this, but I feel a Model Y 2.0 with more of its own parts or having more parts better optimized for it (vs just mainly using Model 3 sedan parts) would be even better."
"Nor would I gainsay car-buyers if they found the Y‚Äôs interior minimalism severe. Shared with the 3, the Y‚Äôs dash is a spare, inclined console of soft-touch ‚Äúvegan leather‚Äù and wood trim, concealing in its layers the blade-like climate outlets. There are flick-able switches on the doors, for windows and opening actuators, and two roller-ball selectors on the steering wheel. All other controls-‚Äîincluding the power tilt/rake of the steering wheel, side mirrors, even climate outlet airflow‚Äîare accessed in the 15-inch center touch screen floating in the center of the dash. Not everyone is down with that.

In my showing the car to neighbors, it seemed to take about 30 seconds for people to make whatever gestalt switch required for their impressions to change from ‚Äúboring‚Äù to ‚Äúrestful.‚Äù A key part of that seems to be the dawning delight of finding oneself under the Y‚Äôs one-piece panoramic glass roof, a terrarium for suburbia‚Äôs bearded dragons.

I look forward to a day when car critics can again suck their thumbs and opine about emotionally chilly styling and split hairs about human factors. Meanwhile, we have this car, this one program, beating the competition on core technology like a drum. From behind the wheel, everything else in this category‚ÄîMercedes-Benz GLC 300, Range Rover Evoque, Jaguar F-Pace, Porsche Macan‚Äîfeels like a sluggish, sloppy antique, a squawking modem trying to connect to the cloud."
Same ‚Äútrim‚Äù?
We (my wife and I) briefly considered ditching our reservation for getting a model 3 after the price drop... But thought we'll just wait it out. Seems like would be major regrets (and we have 3 kids so a hatchback is much appreciated)
"

The Model Y‚Äôs satisfactions as a driving machine‚Äîits fierce, velvety acceleration, deep-pile powertrain isolation, the absence of friction and stiction, under load and under braking‚Äîare partly born of discontent with the current generation of stammering gassers (see above), all with herky-jerky, multimodal drive programs. From now until about 2030, and irrespective of what the U.S. federal government decrees, global car makers will be shrinking, hybridizing and digitizing their gas-powered engines until they vanish altogether. The endgame of petroleum will be a decade of dizzy, overtaxed turbo four-cylinders, cutting off and on at stop lights, shuddering like washing machines.

The Y, by contrast, is quiet as a Trappist. Even its lips are pursed. In the basement is roughly 75 kWh worth of lithium-ion cells, powering an induction motor in front and a larger, permanent magnet motor in the rear. When fully entrained, the gadget throws 384 hp and 376 lb-ft against its 4,416-pound mass. Zero to 60 mph goes by in a crisp 4.8 seconds (3.5 seconds for the 456-hp Performance version). At highway speed, our LR/AWD Y was capable of gasp-inducing bouts of acceleration, surging into triple digits with quite ridiculous nonchalance.

Even setting aside the Y‚Äôs brawny batteries and humma-hunka motors, this car is a little dreadnought of innovation, advancing in fields as diverse as body engineering and HVAC systems. Because heating and air-conditioning can be a huge drain on batteries, Tesla developed a super-efficient heat pump for climate control; as well as a remarkably compact network of coolant loops coming together at the ‚ÄúOctovalve,‚Äù serving the thermal needs of disparate systems. The HVAC‚Äôs efficiency is crucial to the Y‚Äôs 316 miles of range.

The touch screen interface, and the graphical software behind it‚Äîsmart, playful, situationally aware, connected to the hilt‚Äîsets a standard that other infotainment and driver-assistance systems undershoot by a mile. The voice-command system works well out of the box, and its error rate declines with use.

Genius abounds: A setting in the Toybox menu allows drivers to let rip a series of hilarious fart sounds at the touch of a button. You can also make the tootskies your turn-indicator tone, which my 12-year-old twins assure me never gets old. Using the interface you can move the farts‚Äô acoustical center of pressure around, making it louder in one seat or another. What a time to be alive."
Yeah both LR AWD with the upgrades rims (only option even though I‚Äôll go aero or Gemini).
Did you go with the 7-seat configuration?
"Want to dive deeper? Seek out reverse-engineering specialist Sandy Munro, of Munro & Associates Inc. in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Mr. Munro, who typically sells his research to car makers, has made a remarkable series of YouTube videos tearing down the Y to the last nut, bolt, and screw. Often appearing on-camera in a face mask, Mr. Munro has become an EV folk hero during the pandemic, genially detailing the Y‚Äôs breakthroughs while reminding the ‚Äúboys and girls‚Äù watching to ‚Äútip those cashiers.‚Äù Mr. Munro said he was slightly horrified by his sample car‚Äôs paint finish; he also noted that the panel gaps of this early build were inconsistent. Even with that, Mr. Munro told the website Teslarati, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone right now has a way of challenging Tesla.‚Äù

Exasperated, some may argue that, however advanced the rest of the Y is, its battery pack is still too heavy, bulky, weak, and expensive to represent real disruption. CEO Elon Musk would agree. Tesla watchers are anticipating that the company will reveal the results of its research partnerships and in-house programs at its next investor conference, called Battery Day. Among the newsy nominals, a rumored ‚Äúmillion-mile battery‚Äù‚Äîa storage technology capable of decades of use in cars, and thereafter in stationary smart-grid storage. Tesla has no comment.

Meanwhile, Tesla has reportedly been developing its own less costly, more energy-dense cells and packs, along with the mega-maufacturing needed to bring them to scale. Some analysts expect Mr. Musk to announce cell costs below $100 per kWh, a widely recognized inflection point at which it becomes cheaper to build an electric car than its gas-powered equivalent. BloombergNEF estimates that the industry average won‚Äôt reach that mark until 2024.

Will legacy car makers ever catch up? It‚Äôs debatable."
"Nope. My kids are 14, 12, 9, so they wouldn't be fitting in the rear anyway. However the headroom would be much appreciated. We're in between dogs right now, so when we do get another, the hatch would be immensely helpful.
Also, being higher off the ground is really nice. We have a lexus rx and love being able to see further out"
thanks king.
I have seen several people bring up this topic. The area circled in red is an explosive cylinder that activates during a collision. When the cylinder fires it tightens the seat belt several inches by pulling the flexible rod (blue circle) forward and down. This is a safety feature not a defect. There is also a YouTube video on Munro Live Model Y E38. I did not know about this until seeing the video and researching further. Hope this helps. Thanks.
TIL that not everyone watched every second of every Y teardown by Munro.
"I also own a 2005 Toyota 4Runner and it has an explosive charge attached to the seat belt assembly. I always assumed that a lot of cars have this, rather than solenoid-based pretensioners.

 [https://auto.howstuffworks.com/car-driving-safety/safety-regulatory-devices/seatbelt4.htm](https://auto.howstuffworks.com/car-driving-safety/safety-regulatory-devices/seatbelt4.htm)"
What‚Äôs the ‚Äúseat belt appearance‚Äù referring to? I think I‚Äôm out of the loop and missing some context.
"Thank you guys! It doesn‚Äôt bug me, just wasn‚Äôt sure. I appreciate all the help! Love this thread and this car!"
"[link to your post with video](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/haexj0/having_got_in_an_argument_earlier_on_this_page_i/fv2frt5?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)


Love Munro!"
Maybe this? https://electrek.co/2020/06/16/tesla-model-y-quality-issues/
Time to cancel order this level of quality is unacceptable
"I have some of the similar issues you describe, minus the dent in the hood, mobile service can‚Äôt take care of it and it needs to go to the body shop which has a wait of 2 1/2 - 3 weeks currently. 

When I talked to the appointment setter there he said he has 17 Model Y‚Äôs (as of last week) waiting for due bill issues - at the body shop, not mobile service. This is in Chicago where there are 3 Tesla dealerships but still feels like a lot. 

I didn‚Äôt think there were too many issues initially but keep finding things, and I‚Äôm willing to let some minor things go. All in all it‚Äôs soured some of my excitement about the car but am hoping that once it gets service I‚Äôll be good to go, but I agree, if this was a Ford or Honda I wouldn‚Äôt be putting up with this."
You did the right thing. IDK how Elon isn't fed up with this by now either.
It is 100% a lottery. Totally unacceptable.
Sorry to hear all the issues you had to deal with. I'm pushing my delivery to July or even Aug so they would hopefully iron things out by then. What range is your Vin in May I ask?
"I keep being told, it's only the people with problems who complain and write these things, and there are thousands of happy customers NOT saying anything. 

But I'm not sure I agree. Thanks for sharing your experience.

I am thinking I will get my $3200 deposit back and try again in a year, hopefully some of the kinks will be worked out. The car has already increased in price - my deposit is for $71K, the new pricing is closer to 76K CDN. This is not the performance model.."
Canceled mine too. Bought a barely used Model 3 off tesla.com!
"Glad to hear you're rejecting a vehicle this poorly inspected before it left the factory. I'm not a Tesla hater by any stretch, but I truly hope they get their quality control issues resolved soon."
"As someone who finally hit my goal and can buy one, stories like these are definitely making me wait to order, especially since it‚Äôs crunch time for Q2 and I can only imagine similar quality issues will prevail for some time. Hopefully by end of Q3 things will look better."
"I'm glad I waited til end of 2019 to get my model 3, still alignment issues I need to submit. And I'm planning to wait til 2023 for the model Y. I don't hear much about model S or X being poor quality as much as I hear model 3 and Y issues. Albeit lower volume for S/X. Hoping the time will allow further improvements. 

There's a fix for the right rear passenger seat too high. Sounds like they fixed it from production. I read one post about someone getting that fixed by service center getting some parts from the factory. 

Maybe I'll just get an X if new battery and new charging is instituted. Section 179 will help equalize the cost."
Heat pump is louder regardless of having problems or not
"I'm curious, if you purchased this with an auto loan, how do returns (and re-purchases?) work?"
"UPDATE: Thanks everyone for your support, concern, and advice. Unfortunately, something really bad happened. On my way to return the car, a farm truck that wasn't paying attention rear-ended me and did significant damage to the bumper and tailgate. Just to be sure, I called Tesla, and sure enough, the return policy doesn't cover me massively trashing my new car (even after I get it repaired under insurance). So... I'm going to be keeping it, and getting the fit and finish stuff fixed up over time. I'll keep you posted how that goes. I'm also going to start a YouTube channel to document the repair process since as far as I can tell, nobody has done this much damage to a Model Y yet. Life, lemonades... oh and FUCK 2020.

https://imgur.com/P8FQJll"
"They are really rushing out Model Y‚Äôs to make up for the lockdown and the quality is dipping because of it. I wouldn‚Äôt take an order right now because it‚Äôs still logistically somewhat difficult (trying to be safe and such), but now car quality is a big reason too, it seems."
"I understand your frustration, but there are soooooo many positive deliveries out there. The bad ones make all the noise and get all the attention. One thing I will tell you: you will absolutely regret cancelling your order and getting something else. FOMO will fuck you up."
"You can always take as much time as you need at the delivery center to check out the car from front to back. There was a guy who even brought a calliper across from where I was at the delivery center getting his Y.

My Y only had a small scratch on the plastic behind the drivers seat which took about an hour to fix at the SC. Before you sign any paperwork or hand over any checks, look over the car. I'm glad I did it that way rather than sign everything and just take it home to inspect later."
"I made an appt with the dealer but got transfer to the bodyshop in Elk Grove within a few days because I was very disappointed that they just pat some paint in my paint chip, then said they‚Äôre not a body shop. (They shouldn‚Äôt touch up the paint if they couldn‚Äôt do it right)"
Right??? I thought for sure that negative posts around the build quality were either trolls or vocal disgruntled customers. That‚Äôs how the Internet usually works. But I think the reality is like half the Teslas are coming off the line needing substantial rework at a service center. To the point where even people who had a ‚Äúgood‚Äù delivery experience are scheduling service the minute they get home.
"Thanks, I appreciate it. It was 13XXX. Yeah, they may get their act together by then. Best of luck!"
"I was going to reject at delivery. Decided to keep it. Two days later in the sun I found at least 10 issues, all relatively minor. I‚Äôm going to return. Sad about it but I‚Äôd rather wait and get a different trim."
"This particular noise is like a deep thrumming sound, like a train going by, that sort of fades in and out every 20 seconds or so. Not sure if that's normal or not."
"Unfortunately, I won't be able to return it after all. I damaged it on the way back to the dealership, violating the return policy. Fuck 2020."
fuck...  sorry that happened to you.
"Let's assume good deliveries outnumber bad ones 10 to 1, and all we hear about is the bad ones. That's still a completely unacceptable ratio in a $60k+ car and way worse than any other manufacturer.

I'm getting my car Friday and am still excited. But I don't feel like I'm joining some kind of elite world-saving fan club. It's just a car. I'm just a customer. If it has issues, then it has issues.

Even if it's perfect, which I still very hope it is, then I don't feel the need to reflexively defend the company or my purchase decision from online criticism. I am not a long-term ""brand loyalty"" kind of person with anything that I own."
"Even those who are excited to drive the MYs off the lot admit they have faults. This is not a case of a few loud complainers, rather too few."
"You don't have to wait for a year. Some people were able to place the order again within a week.

In your case, you can place an order when you feel comfortable with the thought of improved build quality. I am more nervous than excited at this time for my upcoming delivery this weekend."
What was damaged?!
"Exactly this. It's certainly the case that people will shout about the bad more than the good. But there's no special reason why Tesla would be unique in this. Other brands would also face the same issue *if* they had the same quality problems. I think it must be clear by now that this issue, if not unique to Tesla, is definitely *worse* at Tesla, and there's no use beating around it.

I'm looking forward to my car and I think the functionality will blow me away, but we should all be unified in saying that these issues are unacceptable at the rate that we're seeing them. Bear in mind, Tesla has produced around ~17k Model Ys. This isn't an enormous number, yet the issues roll in every day around common and consistent themes. There's a problem here! Point it out so they have to rectify it."
"Advice: don't buy special orders that are booked in the last few weeks of the last month of a quarter. Inventory is ok, but there's no real MY inventory. Everything now rushed. They'll make it right, but it's a process. Good luck."
"Originally I was excited about my upcoming delivery. Now, I'm just nervous. However, I will not take delivery UNTIL I've gone over the car, even if it's an hour or more. This will be my first Tesla, but my second EV. I can only let just so much go"
"I got rear-ended on the interstate by a farm truck not paying attention. It's pretty messed up. Yeah... not ""original condition"" anymore. The first accident I've ever been in 17 years happened in the first 50 miles of Tesla ownership. Go figure.

https://imgur.com/P8FQJll 

I hope your day turns out better than mine ;)."
"Tesla has a lot of love, and a lot of hate. Google some other manufacturer issues. They all have serious issues."
"I am talking to myself not to take delivery if it has any issues. I will ask them to postpone my delivery until they fix it. Worst case, put me back in line.

I am worried if I take delivery, I lose leverage and they can say most of the issues are within spec or something."
That is tragic! Maybe it'll buff out üëÄ
Exactly. Better to walk away if there are any issues you feel are not acceptable
"BRB, let me go try the ScratchX."
"When you get that YouTube channel going, please drop it here üòÅ"
"Haha. That‚Äôs the spirit! 

I tried to install mine yesterday and totally biffed it. I‚Äôll try again in a couple days. Maybe I was just excited about my new car. Lol"
[removed]
Which one was this?
What floor mats are you using ??
"How ""scratch-able"" is the glossy black finish? It looks like you did a pretty good job!"
"Pro tip - next time before you do it leave the vinyl in the car with the A/c on at about 65 for about an hour. Get in and do the job in the cold, it‚Äôs easier"
"Me too! Managed to get the middle piece on with an ""I guess I can live with that"" quality, then completely botched the top piece and ruined it.  I am constitutionally incapable of applying anything like this - screen protectors, etc.  I think I'm just going to order one of those plastic stick-on covers instead."
[removed]
"That is my only concern with those types of finish.  I really like the Matrix Dot pattern from Abstract Ocean, and I feel like it will actually hold up to wear and tear.  Probably the reason a lot of people go with carbon fiber."
Thanks for the tip! I will give this a shot! I will take the help I can get to make this easier. Lol
I will try one more time because I got two. But I think the stick on ones are most likely what I end up doing! Lol
Cool!
Is this Burbank? I drove by on Wed there was a X parked without the Model X letters in the back and I thought it was the MY.
Renton? Just picked up there today!
"Renton, WA"
Yep. There were quite a few model Ys ready to be delivered to their owners today. Congrats!
Had a great experience. Super responsive reps leading up and day-of and super easy process. Only a few minor issues I‚Äôll see if they can address.
Stunning pictures. Congratulations.
"The non-PUP comes with the spoiler, but does it come with the pedals?"
Looking great!
Good looking car!  The white really pops in your pictures!
Thx!‚ò∫Ô∏è
"So roomy, glad you are loving it too!"
"Well, there is a red line under dual motor on the screen and on the vehicle. However, I ordered the long range...the wheels are the gemini, no fancy pedals, etc. I‚Äôd attach a pic in this comment if I could figure out how(I‚Äôm a newbie here)"
Thank you üòä
the long range y does not have the performance pedals
ThxüôÇ
right?! i am super happy about all the storage and will definitely use it with work & travel! ...i'll check out your new whip ;)
You got a Performance without PUP package for free then (comes with spoiler but not the pedals/rims/brakes).  Keep quiet about it.  Congrats!
You can upload a photo to [imgur.com](https://imgur.com) for free and then just paste the link here. Reddit is a little wonky with image stuff.
"I know but this looks like a Performance without PUP, from the spoiler, not a long range?"
The underfloor trunk space is HUGE.
"Really? Is that a thing?

so help me...if Elon comes to take her away it will not be pretty"
https://imgur.com/gallery/DiJOwK0
"it is long range, not the upgrade performace (although i think it performs rather well myself)"
They already attributed the VIN to your title (which will also designate Performance) and both parties signed papers.  She's yours.  Elon's loss.
"Interesting, I don't think I've seen an LR with a spoiler.  Lucky you!"
"You have a **performance spoiler** on the tailgate.  Open up your ""About"" tab in your car and see what it says.  Maybe you got lucky and walked away with a Performance without PUP instead of a Long Range."
"...I mean, I do feel like it‚Äôs fate"
Wait. So how does this work re performance? Does he have all the necessary hardware to get the 0-60 of the performance but it‚Äôs software limited to the performance of a LR?
I think Elon just added it as a bonus...what a guy!
"I can find the ""about"" tab but don't see anything about the spoiler or how it was ordered/designed exactly"
...is a road test the only way to answer that? My wheels are not the PUP
"When you order a Performance vehicle, you can order it with or without the Performance Upgrade Package (PUP).  It is a no cost option.  It includes the larger wheels (and summer tires), lowered suspension, and aluminum pedals.  Some people do not want the wheels/tires/suspension (horrible up north), so that is why the non-PUP exists.

The PUP package has little effect on the 0-60 or other performance capabilities of the vehicle.  For the Model 3, at least, a non-PUP is slightly faster than a PUP because of the lighter/smaller radius wheels.

You can check it out on the Tesla order configuration page."
I think the prior comment was asking you to confirm what your car is saying it thinks it is...
"It's just as fast, with or without the PUP package.  It should also have track mode and all the other Performance software goodies."
"That wasn‚Äôt the question. He ordered a LR. He received a Performance sans PUP. Based on those facts, revisit my question. 

There no harm in not knowing.

EDIT: I see where you answered the question in a comment to the OP commenting on mine. Thanks!"
"Yes, but aside from the miles, vin, software version, and owners manual...i‚Äôm finding no other details. I know it‚Äôs the long range AWD with 19‚Äù wheels....I guess the spoiler, suede on the inside are some of the bonuses that don‚Äôt come with the standard"
"Is there a red line under the ""Dual Motor"" designation on the ""About Your Tesla"" popup screen?  If you have a red line there, it is a Performance model, not a normal Dual Motor (Long Range).

For example, this is what a Model 3 Performance screen looks like: [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiKax-GVAAAP4sb?format=jpg&name=large](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiKax-GVAAAP4sb?format=jpg&name=large)"
"Well, there is a red line under dual motor on the screen and on the vehicle. However, I ordered the long range...the wheels are the gemini, no fancy pedals, etc. I‚Äôd attach a pic in this comment if I could figure out how(I‚Äôm a newbie here)

The most well put together Y in history.
I think it's safe to say Jay isn't too familiar with towing: [https://youtu.be/cH79SuivdAQ?t=615](https://youtu.be/cH79SuivdAQ?t=615)
Does he have a MSM? It looks almost very dark blue inside his warehouse.
Guarantee there was a dedicated QC Team on this car.
"Exactly - nice Telsa PR piece. I will say the most enjoyable parts was Jay talking history, waking Elon up and buying his S, etc. The tech review itself was like every other YouTube review."
Definitely better in the outside shots where you can see it‚Äôs MSM.
Took the Y up on our first road trip. First day into the trip and we get rear ended at a traffic light. Expected to walk behind the car to see it bashed in but couldn‚Äôt believe that it was only scratches and perhaps just a panel that got shifted / popped out of place. After a pleasant exchange of insurance information we were on our way again. Will definitely get it check out by a professional to make sure no sensors got messed up during the hit but overall it held up better than my expectations.
"Hey, we‚Äôre new Y rear-end buddies! Too bad mine was a truck :(.


https://i.imgur.com/P8FQJll.jpg

Good luck with your repairs! FWIW, mine has no structural damage beyond what you can see on the bumper and liftgate, so yours is going to be A-OK."
"I dunno, your license plate is barely recognizable after the collision."
"Damn, that sucks. Glad you're safe and the damage wasn't too bad. Good to see the Model Y held up pretty well!"
Did your autopilot still work after this?
"Paint color looks different on hatch, than on bumper. Reminds me of that photo the guy posted about his MY door being a different shade of white."
I don't see where they hit you? Sorry to hear that you had something happen so soon :'(
"I‚Äôve only had mine for a couple of days and I was thinking that the risk of a rear end collision is probably higher due to the regenerative braking. When you let off the accelerator but don‚Äôt need to touch the break to stop do the brake lights go on? If not, the guy behind you probably won‚Äôt know you are stopping."
That's I5-N if I've ever seen it.
What's the timeline on your repair? I've heard horror stories (several months).
"What‚Äôs the process for repair? Did you go through insurance first, then Tesla? Or just insurance?"
üòÇ
"Yes, it would have put a damper on our trip if it had been bashed in. Also now I get to learn about the Tesla / insurance portion of fixing Tesla‚Äôs."
"Yes, still works well."
I would say the same thing when I was looking at the picture but for some reason dirt / grime accumulate on the bumper and side panels extremely fast compared to the hatch. The hatch stays cleaner longer and we hade just driven 150+ miles.
Regen causes brake light. Watch the little car picture on the display.
"Yes, regen causes the brake to come on. Can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs regen or inertia that makes it come on but it‚Äôs either of the two"
LOL. Complete with a wrecked car pulled over between the right lane and an exit.
"Seattle has a first party Tesla body shop which apparently helps with lead times on the parts. The people at the shop (who were super friendly and professional) has confidence that parts would take 1-3 weeks to order, and then 9 days of labor to fix everything. They said it‚Äôs gotten a lot better since the early days of the Model 3. Even with the Y they‚Äôve seen parts show up within a week. I‚Äôll definitely post an update once I get this whole situation dealt with so keep an eye on this sub."
"This is my first ever accident, so I‚Äôm learning how it works. I first went to the Seattle Tesla body repair shop and got an estimate. They ordered the parts on the spot. Then I filed a claim with the truck driver‚Äôs insurance, because they were at fault and are accepting 100% liability. I sent over the estimate the body shop had given me to the insurance adjuster and then once they approve it (Monday probably?) I think I‚Äôm good to schedule the actual repairs.

You can instead go through your insurance but then you have to pony up the deductible. It gets refunded later after they determine you‚Äôre not at fault and extract the money from the other driver‚Äôs insurance.

In your case the damage is so minor, you might not even need to go to a body shop. I‚Äôm not sure how to get an estimate from a service center since the app doesn‚Äôt really give you that option. I would just ask your insurance adjuster what the process is. Hopefully they‚Äôve seen it before."
"Man, those Gemini‚Äôs are growing on me."
Got mine today too!
Interior pics
How do you feel about your view through the rear mirror?
"Looks very good. How are your panel gaps, paint and tail light alignments. I was hoping this new batch got them sorted out at the factory. 

What is your VIN range if you don't mind."
 Tiburon! - I'll keep an eye out for your Y!
"This is exactly my build, too and I can't wait! Should only be 1-2 weeks (got text but no VIN yet though). I was actually considering changing to black seats because I am anxious to get the car, but even just seeing the top of the driver seat in your photo I'm SO GLAD I didn't do that - looks amazing!

ENJOY!"
"How are you liking your Gemini‚Äôs? Honestly they‚Äôre growing on me too, and I don‚Äôt mind that they‚Äôre hubcaps. Saving an extra 2k definitely makes a difference. Would you keep it the same or wish you opted for the induction?"
Congrats! Glad to hear some good news about delivery for once. I'm in the Bay and 4 weeks out from ordering but with a black interior. Name her yet?
Wowow
More!  We need more pictures!
What about the Y is better than the 3?
"Yup, same here; and the ride comfort alone makes them 100% worth it, while the +2-3% range increase is just icing on top. Also, less $ is always nice. :)"
"Eh. It's fine. But then, I think I got used to driving my wife's New Beetle Cabrio the last few months and the view through that cabrio top is just as limited. So no big deal."
"Gaps and alignments seem fine. I don't think they're perfect, but there's nothing glaringly obvious or bad that warrants wasting time trying to fix. The VIN range is 14xxx; build date is listed as June 2020. Only real concern is that trunk inexplicably doesn't close anymore :("
Yup! Are you local too? DM me if you like and we can meet up in town if you want!
"at best, I love them; at worst, I don‚Äôt even care :)"
"Taller seating position and storage.  If those do not matter, get a 3. If you live in cold weather the heat pump on the Y will help with range in the winter."
My wife and I test drove a Y last week and we loved it but she was worried about that rear window size.  I feel like the Y is the perfect car for her in every way aside from that.  Glad to hear it sounds like you get used to it.
"That's nice. I think the Hatch not closing is a new issue that i have watched on Ben Sullins Youtube video for the 1st time. May it's the new issue that popped up this month.

I hope it's a small and easy fix. My VIN is also 14XXX and hopefully, it won't have any major issues."
"How long did it take for you to get it? Did you have to drive to Fremont to pick it up, or do they bring it to the SF showroom? Looks dope."
I am. I have a 2016 S and my wife has a very early 2018 3. Thinking seriously about selling the S for the Y - The S is great but it's a very large vehicle... I may be in touch to check it out once I'm ready to risk coming out of lockdown :)
"Ooof, already showing some dirt."
[Thread](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/updates-on-black-my.193756/page-6)
"Oh man, that looks so good.  I think that picture is the epitome of what you can expect with respect to showing dirt and it doesn't bother me one bit."
"Hello, Ive ordered black and got vin on Monday 6/1 then first text confirming financing. They said a week or so until delivery text on 6/2. Getting impatient so used the chat today 6/8 and got generic chat that just said ""expected to be around end of month"" per below..guess it maybe longer than some of the lucky people with short VIN to delivery timelines. Back to waiting and refreshing.

>Shawn: Thank you for your patience. I see the VIN is assigned to your order. Once the delivery center has a clear arrival date for your vehicle they will be sending out the scheduling text.  
>  
>Me: sweet thanks! I assume that could be anywhere from 1-15 days or so but should expect before end of June?

>Shawn: It is expected to be around end of month.

>ME: o ok that helps set expectations. let me know if theres anything else on ETA you can share

>Shawn: That is pretty much it for now."
"Mmmmm, love the gaps!"
I thought these didn‚Äôt have chrome?
Worth it. Lol
Agreed fully.
It‚Äôs white tape for protection during shipping as far as I know :)
"That car probably has never gotten a wash, and it's dusty and rainy, what do you expect?"
"Correct, it‚Äôs tape. I thought it was chrome the first time I saw one with tape."
"If you're thinking of wrapping it, I'd consider just doing stealth PPF instead."
"What's the deal with these wraps btw?

Can you take them to a car wash once wrapped? Do you need to worry the wrap will tear? Looks pretty cool"
"Really hoping to see more pics of black wraps as that will likely be the way I go with mine. 

Thanks y'all.

"I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs black, but I get it."
"Yes! That looks completely amazing, thank you."
"Do you have any examples of the ""murdered"" logo you're referring to? I have no idea what you're talking about..."
"Hmm, that definitely looks different than something like XPEL Stealth on a black car. 

In my opinion it doesn‚Äôt look great in that photo, kind of cheap. I‚Äôve seen XPEL Stealth and it looks much (in my opinion) classier. Maybe it‚Äôs just the photo. 

Let‚Äôs see some XPEL Stealth once these black cars get delivered!"
Do you not like driving at night?
"In CA here, 70% is the darkest we can go."
Do the inductions come with summer tires?
Just did my front with 60% today.
"Unfortunately I‚Äôm high risk for skin cancer. The upside is I have a tint exemption. My current vehicle has 50% on the windshield and 5% everywhere else. I‚Äôm waiting for the standard range Y, but this may be as good of a place as nay to ask. What type of tint is on the glass roof?"
Yes
"As a frequent pedestrian who values my life, fuck this.  People will never be able to tell if you can see them before they cross the street.  Too many drivers only look left for other cars before turning right, even in the city.  But hey, it looks cool..."
I can see really good at night...  my previous vehicle did have tints too dark so I had them removed  but on the Tesla I didn‚Äôt go too dark.
Also in CA you can board up your back 3 windows
Yes
"It‚Äôs like a 30% on the glass roof, when it gets to 90 degrees you do feel it enough to bother you a bit"
I get your point of view.
That sucks! Here in Florida 28% front and 15% rear
"That's not what the service center told me. They said only the 21""."
Does it have any UV protection?
"I believe they were incorrect. Owners have posted the tires and when you look them up, they are summer tires. At least that‚Äôs what I have read.  I‚Äôm looking for the post."
I also recall a comment where someone looked up the specs for them and posted a pdf and they were all season. I don‚Äôt have it saved though.
"Yeah, I‚Äôm trying to find it now. They might be high performance tires but still all season."
I really hope so. Everyone seems so contradicted and I‚Äôm waiting for my YP with 20‚Äù and don‚Äôt want to have to buy new tires :(
Where do you live?  You may not need all season tires.
Seattle.
Did you design your charging setup at home around a retro gas pump? Because if so that's simply awesome.
Brilliant setup. The only thing that could make it better is if you could somehow fit the gas pump handle onto the Tesla plug.
"Yes. Got the gutted retro gas pump, rust proofed it, engaged a land scraper to set it up with a concrete block and gravel. Then got the electrician to install the Tesla charger. Took a couple of months to get it all wrapped up. Then waited for the Y delivery and it finally came on Saturday June 27, 2020."
I agree! LOL
More pics please especially of the interior
Nice! I‚Äôll be there tomorrow to pick mine up. White with white interior and Gemini wheels. Long range
Did they let you inspect the interior before accepting delivery?
Does it have the spoiler?
really nice. that‚Äôs one of the quintessential configs üëç
Did you have any issues with the paint matching correctly. I am waiting on my white Model Y this is my biggest concern! Thank you!
"Also, do you have the red performance emblem under dual motor?"
"Hi, sorry I am having difficulty loading photos..  ( Newbie user issues mostly)  Will follow up once I get some help.... :)"
"Negative. They are keeping things moving.  We were there for over an hour, and spent time just exploring the car, but they were not collecting feedback.  They said to document all issues and report them via the app."
Yes
Yes.  Carbon Fiber Spoiler.  Looks awesome.
"Thank you.  Its absolutely beautiful.    I was in the front yard and have 3 people in the neighbourhood stop by and one guy driving past did a u-turn in his car to ask if this was the new Model Y.  The color combination is very minimalistic and mono-chromatic, the black and white interior with pearl white exterior is stunning."
No issues.  Paint all looks perfect.
This is such bullshit considering they haven‚Äôt even filled all preorders yet.
My Y is still on order. No VIN yet. Can I add a referral code to a pre-existing order?
"If I refer myself do I get 2,000 miles or only the 1,000?"
Can‚Äôt get it added unfortunately. They say it is only for new orders and not ones still waiting.
Just emailed them and was denied.
Dang it. Just took delivery Thursday and wanted to use a referral code.
[removed]
Can you explain to Tesla newbie? Car still on order. Thanks.
I contacted my Delivery Specialist and he told me this was only for orders placed after June 9. Where's the love?
Totally agree!
Yes. I just called them and they let me use a referral code for my order I placed on 3/20. Still waiting on that VIN...
[removed]
I didn‚Äôt even get a response.
[removed]
"1,000 Supercharger miles are available with referral code from current owners when you order the 3, S or X. When we ordered our MYs this option wasn't available. As of June 9, any new order is eligible for 1,000 miles of Supercharger credits with anyone's referral code. 

Unfortunately, for those of us who ordered prior to June 9, and are still waiting for our MYs, we aren't eligible for this perk."
Called who?
I was mostly curious; I‚Äôve got a friend with a 3D that I‚Äôve gone ahead and used his code for.
These directions worked perfectly for me. Thank you!
"I called the number, spoke to Daniel, gave him the referral code and he said he'd add it by EOD."
Yep. Emailed and they denied my request.
"Yeah, called who?  


(So far I've emailed Tesla referrals and my Delivery Specialist, but haven't heard back)"
I just called Tesla Fremont sales and they were able to add the referral code
No worries! Thanks!
"Let us know how this goes. I just tried, got through, and was told no. That you would have had to order through the link. It sounds like some of their customer service people allowed people to call in and add the link, and now they are not doing that. Will be interesting to see if you actually get credited."
Moderator work for tesla? (kidding)  I tried calling tesla today and they refused to do it on 2 occasions.  I screenshotted this post so i could remember the number... Sounds like they are pretty hellbent on not adding it though.  Curious if it ever actually got added for you?
Can you tell us what you did? The comment was removed.
Can you give me Daniels info?  No one seems to want to add it today lol
Yeah. They denied me too. No love I tell ya!
"Yeah, called who?"
"Wow, I called yesterday and they told me no. Why are they so all over the place?"
"This definitely works. I also was just in my local Tesla dealer (for something else), and they were also like ""Oh yeah, let me check that for you! If that other person didn't set it, I'll do it right now.""  


So, this can definitely be done."
"Mine is definitely added. I got positive confirmation from the Tesla Referral e-mail that this would be done, and two different representatives at showrooms that it would be done (or it was already showing up). Additionally, as of today, I'm showing up on my referral's view that I ordered from him (he just sent me a screenshot)."
"I don't have a direct number, I followed the options above. Maybe try a different location, the reps are prob tired of everyone calling that same number."
"Can you give the options, please? The comments were deleted."
"Congrats, truly jealous!"
Sexy
Nice this is my config too. Somewhat concerned on the white color since it seems to be the color with the most issues but all we can do is carefully inspect it ourselves like you're doing right? Congrats!
"Thanks for the update! I‚Äôm less nervous when I see posts like this one. I‚Äôm willing to take a chance on delivery. I just hope that if they can‚Äôt deliver a perfect vehicle (as it should be), they will at least offer another one without defects."
I think the color of the rear door looks a little off.
Very nice!
Heck yeah! Glad it worked out
My VIN is 17XXX and the build date is also 6/20. Interesting.
"Vin's are reserved in blocks and assigned somewhat randomly to keep production numbers more of a secret until quarterly announcements. So using VINs to get an idea of build quality is only good for lose estimates, build date is a much better metric."
"6/20 build and 21xxx for me, so there‚Äôs quite a range"
Picked up my Model Y today and absolutely fell in love.
"Ahhh right next to the Bezos Balls. Take that, Bezos!"
"In general, I‚Äôm not a fan of how the Gemini wheels are silver with the chrome delete - but it works pretty well with the black model Y."
Where is this location?
Seattle in front of Amazon HQ.
"Compared to the LR AWD Model 3 with the performance boost that is technically slower than this performance Model Y PUP, the 3 as a sedan just feels more sporty. 

The Y really glides down the road and is super freaking spacious. It really reminds me of the Lexus RX 350 I used to own."
Congrats. Picked mine up yesterday same exact one as you. Love it
"I feel a bit better about my choice now.

I have this configuration as a 7 seater.  Seeijg this picture makes me feel better about its appearance."
"Bigger as in it feels bigger on the inside, or as it feels like driving a truck?"
Thanks!
"Ordered the exact spec on 2/22.  Still waiting... 

When did you order?"
"If you like the picture you will LOVE the look when you see it in person.  We have the same red Y with 20s.  

At first I was concerned about the look based on early pictures, but all doubts were quickly erased when I inspected it during delivery and drove away.  It‚Äôs a beast..."
"It‚Äôs no truck - both looks and is bigger on both the interior and exterior.   A truly amazing ride.  The 3 is awesome, the Y just takes all that goodness and jacks it up another notch or two further."
1/30 ordered
"The red just seems darker in person.  I feel like Teslas are amazingly photogenic, but actual eye sight makes things darker.

Ultimately I'm unlikely to change my configuration though.  I'm $4000 cheaper than if I canceled reordered now.  I bought FSD at $6,000, and before the tires were introduced.  So, I'm basically getting the paint and tire upgrades free."
"Just show up at the service center and make them deal with it.  Calling and scheduling appointments with Tesla for serious issues is useless, most of the time.

The 152 degrees isn't necessarily wrong, if it's parked on blacktop."
"I would have suggested setting it on fire, but it sounds like it's going to do that by itself. If it'll make it, present the Grand Canyon with an offering."
Maybe time to start thinking about your local lemon law
"I just had them tow it to the service center. They wanted me to drive it there and I said that probably wasn‚Äôt a good idea since I might die, lol. They unfortunately didn‚Äôt have a loaner to give me so once again I‚Äôll be borrowing my wife‚Äôs car and she‚Äôll be staying home for a 2nd day this week (I refused the Uber credit). I‚Äôm staying optimistic but it‚Äôs still frustrating. I‚Äôve never had issues like this on a new car but I‚Äôm staying positive they can get this fixed because I really do enjoy it. Maybe I‚Äôm stupid."
"Due to a few comments here I did look up on the Arizona Attorney General Website about our lemon laws. It looks like I‚Äôm covered on new vehicles up to the earlier of 2 years or 24k miles. It also looks like I‚Äôm not quite officially at the point where it can be replaced ‚Äúif during the covered period, the manufacturer fails to successfully repair the defect after four attempts, or the car is out of service by reason of repair for a cumulative total of 30 or more calendar days, the manufacturer must accept return of the car or replace the car with a new car.‚Äù I‚Äôm still optimistic they will fix the AC but at least I know that if I continue to have issues I have a backup plan. Still a pretty shitty week though for a new car. Stupid 2020."
[deleted]
"look, im a huge Tesla fan, investor, and owner... Freaking lemon law that thing. it's a lemon through and through and have them replace it."
"Agree with Ross.  Many system glitches can be fixed by a hard reset.  I have had a couple  weird happenings like that on my Model 3 over the past year, but all resolved after a hard resets, and trying again later.  Worth trying"
Tesla....isn‚Äôt even offering a loaner?
Lemon law. Return that POS ASAP and get you a new one.
Tesla are you paying attention?
agree with the other posters  lemon law is there use it   Sorry that you had this experience  I live in Arizona and it is hot as hell
Read up on the Lemon Law! Get a different MY.
"Return and get a Lexus, forget Tesla"
"I‚Äôm used to car outside temperature sensors to be way off, since I live in AZ. Usually after driving around they will adjust to the real temperature. 152 degrees was still showing after driving around for 30 minutes trying unsuccessfully to get the AC to work."
"Sorry you're going through this. It's making me wait for a while until they get QC under control, having to deal with this is ridiculous."
"Helpful, thanks"
"That's not how lemon law works. Without too much detail: you have to give the manufacturer a few chances to fix everything. OP is taking the right steps to bring lemon law into play though but at a minimum, the way lemon laws typically work, is it will have to spend 30 days and/or a certain number of visits to the shop to get the same issue repaired.

Source: I've had a lemon in the past (Not a Tesla). FCA quality control is insanely bad, and it was more expensive than my Model Y."
"Yep, if you drove it around and it doesn't change ... sounds broken.  Sorry man :(  Again, they tend to be much more responsive when you just show up at the shop."
"Sadly I think it‚Äôs for the best to wait. Overall these aren‚Äôt the worst issues but having them within the first 1-2 weeks of having the vehicle is probably the most frustrating. I think Tesla rushed their production for 2nd quarter numbers and it shows. 
If you don‚Äôt mind multiple service trips and you have a backup vehicle for your 60k Tesla then go for it!"
"TL;DR:, It's a tie (with cheating on the MY side). All the suit cases in the picture fit in either car.

&#x200B;

Upgrading from a Subaru Outback to a Tesla Model Y one of the concerns was that the Y has a smaller cargo space. Does the Frunk and the undertrunk make up for the tapered roof and the narrower trunk? I brought out my suitcases and tried with 3 carry on sized, 4 medium, and 2 large (max checkable size). All suitcases were empty and not expanded.

Rear seats are up in both cars (despite what the image above may imply)

Pictures here: [https://imgur.com/a/I7r1xra](https://imgur.com/a/I7r1xra)

Loading the Subaru Outpack is straight forward. You just pile them in, starting with the big ones. And there is still a spare wheel hidden in the undertrunk.

Loading the Tesla is tricky. Neither the frunk nor the undertrunk fit a medium suitcase, so there is a bit of wasted space there. They each take a small one. If you just pile the rest into the trunk, you can't get them all in. I tried many ways. Two of the mediums will have to stay home. However, there is some wasted space below the trunk base boards. If I remove those, I can fit the suitcases (The Tesla unfortunately doesn't have a spare wheel there)

The Tesla shines when going skiing with 4 people. The Subaru has a 40/60 split, and two people on the 60 is very tight. The MY can lower the middle, so you can put a ski bag there, and still comfortably fit 2 adults in the back. My skibag is 190cm long, and I only had one pair of skis inside, but I think it think the pass through could handle 4 pairs. You can still add 4 medium and 3 carry on sized bags in addition (with the trunk base boards in). Of course with the Subaru mounting a ski rack is trivial and keeps the wet skis out of the inside of the car. Probably still the preferred solution.

For good measure, I dumped my street bike into the back, too. Two bikes on top of each other will work no problem (but require some strength and/or teamwork to get them out).

Your mileage will vary depending on your exact luggage formats, but I put in about the same number of cubic feet in each car. The Subaru has a better shape (more like a cube) vs the Tesla with nooks and crannies.

Edit: 
1) The Subaru had an undertrunk, too. Take the spare wheel out (MY has none), and you gain more space, of you need it. Probably better to keep the wheel.
2) the Subaru comes with cross bars and mounting a box, ski rack, or just a large suitcase is trivial. If you buy a carved wooden life size mountain lion on your road trip, just tie it to the roof. The roof rack for the MY looks like it will break the glass)"
Interesting test. My first question: ‚Äúwho the hell travels with that many suitcases?‚Äù
Thanks for the post. Sounds like you wouldn‚Äôt recommend the mats?
"Which would be more comfortable for long-distance driving?  We have a Model 3 and 2017 Outback.  We love the 3 as a daily driver, but have found the ride of the Outback more comfortable for long road trips.  I don't know if it's the firmer ride of the 3 or it's low seated position that makes it less comfortable.  I'm considering trading the 3 for a Y, but just curious if you can comment on the quality of the ride between the Y and the Outback?"
"Interesting, thanks for this. I recently ordered a MY, got rid of my Jeep GC Overland with the V8. It was perfect for everyday healing, Lowes, friends, Dog etc. But looking at this makes me feel better about the amount of space I'll have."
"This is interesting. The Y and Outback XT are both on my short list. City commuter about 20 miles round trip. Family of 4, 2 kids under 10 involved with sports. 

Having a hard time justifying the car due to purchase price over Outback. Wife concerned over the flashiness of the Tesla brand."
Why not get the roof rack for the MY?
People who don't pack well *shots fired*
"I do fill up the Subaru trunk when we go camping. 5 people, tent, sleeping bags, pads, coolers, dry food, water, kitchen, fuel, maybe chairs, some toys, day packs, fire wood. But the suit cases are easier to manage than the camping equipment.

It is amazing how many suitcases we do have, though.

The 2 big ones are from when we had strollers (buggies) and packed everything for 2 adults 3 kids for winter vacation into two suitcases that one parent can pull, with the other handling the kids and stroller. Haven't used them since.

The four medium are for heavy gear (winter) vacation. One per person, plus a small one for the youngest. This is not a lot of luggage when you go skiing for two weeks with 4 people. The boots and helmet alone fill a small suitcase.

[https://imgur.com/NGQHxuK](https://imgur.com/NGQHxuK)

Typically, we travel carry on only, even when traveling for weeks. I agree with traveling light.

But spend some time at any airport luggage carousel, you'd be amazed..."
"Not really. Maybe there are ways to make them flatten more (after you get them you must let them rest for a day on a flat surface, maybe a week will do it?)"
"I am so looking forward to road-trips in the MY :-)

But I haven't done a long ride thanks to shelter in place. Only short grocery runs. After almost 20 years in Outbacks, and almost 10 in the current one, it feels very familiar and comfortable and the Y feels different. I also have 19"" wheels on the MY , so less firm, and I set the steering to comfort. At sports it's too much work.

The Y is still a bouncy ride as I learn one-foot driving.

My expectation is that the advanced driving assistance features will make driving easier (but I have a pre-eyesight 2011 Subaru that doesn't even have variable cruise control - our 2003 mini van does).

What I don't like on the Y compared to the Outback is the bad visibility out of the rear mirror (try to see the inside rear mirrors in the picture above), and the ridiculously high turning radius (can't u-turn into two lanes without backing up, takes 3 lanes)"
"If you want electric and cool tech, buy the Tesla. I just can't justify buying ICE anymore (we are 100% renewable electric). 

I like my old Subaru, and that I can dump a bike in the back without worry of damaging it (more). It does blend in more. The Y especially still gets looks and questions. What I didn't like about Subaru was low reliability/constant recalls, and the dealership an hour away. I have been driving Subaru for 17 years now. My first Subaru (1999 outback) leaked oil when it was less than 10 years old. Not enough to do anything about it, but, you could smell it standing next to it. I am done with ICE engines."
"I worry about it's attachment.

The Subaru one is smart. And folds out of the way when not used."
"If you were camping, you would have more soft squishy things such as sleeping bags that would allow you to more densely pack them into your sub trunk and trunk. That would help out with the loading."
Which mats did you get?  There are so few choices right now.
One foot driving sucks. I could only stand that mode for a few minutes before I switched.

Great - I ordered the same one and still waiting for it.

"Last month I also downgraded from Inductions to Geminis to get the car sooner. I picked up one day after making the change. At the time TSportsline had a 10% off sale for Memorial Day and I bought 20"" TST wheel/tire package for $2340 with free shipping.  I see it as getting a full backup set of geminis with tires for $340."
Congrats!
"I'm waiting for the exact same config here in Ottawa, Canada. Still no call/email/text yet to me :("
"As someone with induction wheels who has already curbed one twice, good choice!"
"Took delivery, she's a beauty!  So far I haven't found anything wrong that bothers me.  Will look it over again tomorrow."
The Gemini wheels ride better. Good choice if you had to make a compromise.
That is a really great way to look at it!  Thank you!

That I‚Äôm not sure. I haven‚Äôt been driving any long distance besides around town and I have to climb a big hill for 1.5 miles to get home. The hill climb kills my efficiency.  When I look at the chart before driving up the hill it‚Äôs about 250 wh/mi. After the hill climb to get home it‚Äôs about 350...
Your mailbox looks like a tiny spoiler on the model y
"Is it a new car, or did they fix the mismatched white paint? Sounds like they really wanted the sale for Q2 as everyone has been saying. Good to see your rejection caused them to act."
This one looks really great!  Congrats!
Location? That looks like SoCal.
They assigned u a new vin in 2 day!?
Or jet thruster...
LOL!  I was about to post asking what that was and then realized it was the white mailbox.
First VIN was 8800 this was 22000.
Thanks!

"1 day üò¨

Advisor said they had my exact build in another city and it would take a few days or the one I went to the first time had a similar build but with the tow hitch."
Model Y SpaceX package.
"Grats! I can't wait to get my white on white as well. Looking at the wheels, I wished they made the center cap with the Tesla logo."
"They did. It‚Äôs just black as well, but looks good when you get up close to it. Just got my VIN tonight but I think I push it out a few months. White on white AWD."
Just got my vin as well and I also ordered white/white. Vin is 23xxx so hopefully it's as nice as the OP's car!
Try it again with empty garage and test it
The radar is hitting the door and the car is just the closest match of the pre-cached 3D images for it to show you that it knows something is there.
"It was most likely stored in the vehicle's cache. Try pulling up to a friend's garage with a car in it, I doubt it'll do this."
This is classic radar reflection. It seems like Tesla is now visualizing radar returns. Think of the garage door as a mirror and Tesla detecting a reflection off of the mirror like it would do with a visual reflection off a mirror.
"UPDATE:  I just tested the same thing with my van removed from the garage.  The Tesla CORRECTLY does not show a vehicle behind the garage door.  This confirms that the radar is reading through the door, and that it is NOT a radar reflection.  Good stuff Tesla!"
I haven‚Äôt heard about caching of objects based on GPS before.  I will try this test by moving the vehicle in the garage and seeing if it still shows up.
"Wow, I can imagine how that might work.  

I really need to test with my van moved, I'll do it tonight after work."
I just remember seeing something similar to this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/fy1mzp/i_just_got_the_version_3_autopilot_computer/) which made me think it's cached.
"If this was an optical mirror, the car would appear right in front of the Tesla.  I assume that the radar is centered on the Tesla and points straight, so it doesn't make sense for the virtual car to be offset to the left."
"Same here in Northern VA, except I didn't get an option. I was suppose to pickup my Y tomorrow and got a call from Tesla saying that the body shop needed to do some work on the car. The car ""may be"" ready next week. It's surreal to get such a call about a new car, but I appreciate not having to see all the ""work"" that's needed. I've seen some really bad delivery YouTube videos."
"Your story is similar in nature to mine. 

[Here is my post about it. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/gtf3px/for_those_following_my_model_y_journey_delivery/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)"
"I took delivery on 4/1 for MY, this is after they delayed twice telling me paint issues, however, I still had to go back to service twice more for paint issues and panel gap adjustments.  I hope they really get down and really fix those issue, but as some has already reported seeing some paint damages after about 1k miles, I have not seen that, except a couple of little dots from likely small rocks and sands from the highway to the bumper."
Good idea get all fixed at once. Mine came with at least 10-15 cosmetic issues. I had it for 2 months and 3 trips for services; very annoying.
"For sure. It's apparently so common, the local center already added this into their playbook"
"Mine couldn't be any more similar to your experience. I had a pickup scheduled today afternoon at Tyco, only to be called yesterday around 5pm to let me know that they've identified panels gaps & alignment issues to fix and it'll be ready for pickup next Wednesday (what?!). Hope it's sooner than that! From what they said, It appears that they've got a bunch of model Ys arrive at the center to inspect and prepare for delivery. Would have preferred to have the option of picking up now and bring back later to fix through service appointments, after letting me see the car. They didn't agree to show the car before the issues can be fixed. Wonder how bad the issues are."
"Yeah, it seems like yours got delayed by a day and mine can be up to two weeks :("
Would mudflaps help? Or it's really paint quality issues?
"Oh wow. I suppose that's *one* way to take the new ride out for a spin :)

Hopefully they got everything though at the end of this. Fingers crossed!"
"Not doubt Tyco is backed up. I think my car's been there since Saturday.
Log into you account, you might see a new  tentative date. My 6/2 has been changed to 6/7. ü§û"
"A day from original date. Potentially 5 days from when they first offered it. 

But yes, tough to be in they spot regardless. 

We get real excited about the opportunity to get the car."
"I noticed a couple of dings on the front bumper face, where similar to M3 which is flat, mud flap not a good look but I will definitely consider it.  I do not see similar issues with my 3yo BMW with paint chips at all."
My pickup has been pushed back to 6/10 and it reflects in the account. They did say so when they called yesterday but were also indicating that they could fix the issues sooner than that.
"Just got my second push back call from Tyco, instead of tomorrow, pickup date is now 6/10 like you. Boooo"
Hmmm... that‚Äôs not good. Did they say why it got delayed?
"They said the body shop is not Tesla owned, but Tesla repair certified, so they have less say in how the jobs are completed/prioritized. Evidently my front passenger door needs paint issue fixed.
I forgot to ask about alignment issues like what I've seen for the charging door/panel. Resetting my anticipation clock again."
I‚Äôm not so confident now mine won‚Äôt be pushed either. This is turning into a nightmare! Hope we get both our MYs soon.... üòê
"Well, please let me know when you get your car. Last week I spoke to a Carlos or Carlo and he pushed me back to 6/10. So today I logged into my account and the date changed from 6/10 to 17,so I decided to call Tyco instead of waiting for them to call me (yes, I now dread calls from Tesla). I reached Carlos again and he thought that he originally told me 6/17,which of course he did not. Anyway, I got the same excuse, car at 3rd party body shop and they have no idea when it will be worked on. I'm sure if I knew the right people, they'd magically get the car in queue and completed. I hope you get through sooner than I do and if you do, I'll press them a little more because saying ""I don't know"" is hardly acceptable. Good luck!"
"I got the dreaded call (I despise these calls from Tesla too) on Monday from one of the service center ppl that they still hadn't received a part that they were waiting for, which is/was on back-order and that they dont have an ETA for it to arrive. So delivery date pushed back by a week atleast. The rest of the work on the car was supposedly complete, not sure how far that's true. An hour or so later I got the call from Carlos explaining that they have a timeline for expecting the part and have tentatively scheduled my delivery to 20th. I'm not sure where to escalate this to and I did express my frustration about this whole scenario. I too felt that their 'I dont know when we will get the part so we can deliver the vehicle' is so unacceptable and mentioned it on the call multiple times. At this point, releasing this VIN and waiting for a new one is heavily playing on my mind. Maybe I need to take a chill pill and wait. Oh well."
"I forgot you mentioned needing a part. Tesla has always had a lot of problems with parts and I'm sure greater COVID-19 related supply chain issues have now amplified the problems. The fact that we are talking about new cars is what's most daft.
I definitely feel like a fool for completing my down payment.
We do need to chill and be still diligent though."
It could be a positive - not having to pay for a car that will have reduced usage until COVID situation improves.
Yikes. That‚Äôs unacceptable.
are you going to return? that seems like an awful lot of serious problems. Can't imagine it'll fare much better with water...
Not acceptable for a $60k+ car.
I‚Äôm convinced. You should move.
"Oof.  I've heard about the noise issues with the seals, but the dust & dirt there is very noticeable."
"Doesn‚Äôt look good. If you really like the car otherwise maybe it‚Äôs worth trying aftermarket seal kits when they‚Äôre available. Like this https://www.rpmtesla.com/collections/model-y-noise-reduction-kits/products/model-3-door-noise-reduction-kit-29-with-20-off

Do Model 3‚Äôs do this too?"
"Is there negative pressure inside the car relative to the outside?

I wonder why dust gets sucked into the car in the first place."
"Anyone else having this issue? I live in one of the dustiest, windiest places in the country (Odessa, TX) but even when I leave my car outside I haven't had this problem. Wondering if this guy's car has defective seals."
Need to see a comparo to another car to judge
omg.
"Wow. That's a major issue. 

I just picked up my car yesterday and I've noticed a few issues post delivery now. I'll make a service appt and hopefully it will be fixed soon. 

My issues are: 

- when driving at higher speeds, I've now noticed that the driver mirror seems to vibrate so the cars in the driver mirror appear to be dancing and shimmering. lol. The passenger one is good and solid and steady

- The rear right side window does not open nor close with the Vent open/close feature of the car. That sucks because I have to manually close that one each time. 

- Also, this might be nothing but I thought the rear windows are supposed to go up and down one tap without having to hold the buttons. If not, then it is my mistake. Only front windows do that. 

- The rear hatch has a little interference from the leather strap that is used to open the below trunk space. It seems to get in the way of the door latch opening and closing many times. I've taped it in for now. But tbh this is a design flaw. I suspect most people who are having rear hatch latching issues is because of this being caught and mis-aligning the trunk causing issues. 

The car is lovely otherwise. But not a good look for such issues on a brand new car. I'll schedule a Tesla SC appt."
"I watched your video last night and thought.. ugh.  But I recalled seeing something like this for the TM3.  Did a little googling, and sure enough, several companies and people have come up with additional door gaskets.  They are mostly for noise, but would certainly reduce dust.

Just google 'Tesla Model 3 door gasket' or similar.  Basically, it is a DIY using off the shelf gasket material to put an extra gasket in the door, hood, and trunk areas to reduce noise (and coincidentally, dust).  

Seems like an easy fix and it will reduce the amount of dirt inside your door frames -- even if Tesla replaced the original gaskets, you'd still get dirt in the frames without this extra buffer."
So there will be more dust on a dirt road after a Model Y drove on it?
Not my car just posting video. Yeah it seems like there are some pressure issues with this car. I‚Äôve seen other posts about it.
"> Vent open/close feature of the car

also gets over ridden when you open and close the door, does not recall it was in vent and closes the window."
"‚ÄúSubject: Model Y production

It is extremely important for us to ramp up Model Y production and minimize rectification needs. I want you to know that it really makes a difference to Tesla right now.

Model Y, especially GA (stands for General Assembly), is the top priority for both production and manufacturing engineering. GA4 (stands for General Assembly Line 4) is also top priority for facility improvements. For those working in GA4, thank you for bearing with tough conditions.‚Äù


‚ÄúRectifications would refer to things Tesla needs to fix on cars that already went through the regular production process.

Based on some of the Model Y posts like this, minimizing rectifications means ignoring them?

GA4 is Tesla‚Äôs now-famous assembly line inside a ‚Äútent‚Äù next to the factory.‚Äù

It figures"
"Any guesses on how many they want to deliver by the end of the month? Seems like a crazy amount based on the spam text messages. My guess like 30,000 MYs in the USA during the month of June."
black interior seems to rule the production line? we have been waiting since last March for a white interior... can they not get white pleather? what ever it is? sigh
"According to a Source, White interior for S 3 X models ship no problem. The factory is trying TOO hard to batch black interior deliveries that it is creating the impression that white interior is ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù or ‚Äúlack of materials‚Äù. It‚Äôs irritating at this point"
I'm wondering if those who are getting major paint issues are due to GA4 assembly line. There is no way you can get a clean room environment in a massive tent. The tone of the email also makes it seem it is not a pleasant environment to work in (heat) especially in the summer.
Agreed. Been waiting since 3/15/19 for my white on white. Arghh. Stupid virus.
based on people reporting dirty prints on head liner and seat backs I think tesla dosnt trust the guys working with white yet....
"Not sure if cars are painted in the tent.  

But you are 100% right about the working conditions under the tent.  This is an article from last year.   

It‚Äôs appalling, it‚Äôs been going on forever since the tent was put up. 


https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/07/15/tesla-workers-in-ga4-tent-describe-pressure-to-make-model-3-goals.html"
Wow...
"Looks like his YouTube channel has a lot of comparison videos... Subaru XV Crosstrek, Model X, S, and 3."
"My two cars are now a LR AWD MY and a 2020 RAV4 Hybrid (wife‚Äôs car). The two are probably pretty comparable in total storage, but the RAV4 may better accommodate full sized suitcases straight up due to the higher rear roofline.  The hybrid is very responsive and well powered. CarPlay is a big plus. For it‚Äôs class, it‚Äôs a nice little SUV. It easily gets its 40MPG rating.

The MY is great in a different way. Very cool technologically and fast, even for the non-performance version. Of course it cost 50% more than the RAVE4 ($60k vs $40k).  The Toyota had practically no defects. The MY was acceptable quality."
I will say I wish Tesla used that more ruby-like red for their cars instead of the paint they use now.
"While the cars appear somewhat similar, in my mind, there's no comparison. The Y is an EV (BEV) while the other one is some kind of a hybrid (PHEV perhaps) with a small 42mile electric range and then gas like the Chevy Volt. 

Personally, one is the car of the future made by the guy who created the modern EV industry. The other is....just another CUV imo. 

No one goes ""hey look, a Toyota Rav4 Prime!!"" while people do go ""hey look! a Tesla"" and some ""hey look kids! a Tesla Model Y"" as kids go ""Wooow"". 

One car is technically software wise so far ahead it is not even funny anymore. 

Not to say the Toyota is bad or anything. In fact, it is a great car and definitely worth it for those who consider it so. I just don't care for it at this point given it has a polluting component and an engine with oil changes and its gazillion parts, spark plugs, fuel injectors, fuel filter, transmission, timing belt and what not. 

Personally, I think people should buy what makes sense for them and happy and whether it is Toyota or a Tesla or whatever (ignoring posts like mine which are clearly biased), buy what is right for you."
That music is wild.
"honestly, this was a pretty bad review and was not that detailed. took 3 or 4 passes between the vehicles as they were trunk to trunk to somehow show off something maybe where the lowered suspension performance model y lines and trunk lands in comparison to the trunk of the rav 4?"
"I'm sorry but the Model Y interior looks like junk compared to even a RAV4. Tesla has a long ways to go to compete in this area. I get its fun, futuristic, etc but the materials used for this car are equal to a 20k car at most."
"No offense to RAV4 owners (I was *this* close to buying one myself), but assuming Y is not that diff my 3, no comparison. Test drove a non-hybrid 2019. Slow. Same functional but dated Toyota electronics, except Apple CarPlay. Zero regrets choosing M3 over RAV4."
"The RAV4 prime is REALLY going to blur this line.  The XSE Prime w/ upgrade package brings a LOT of features to the vehicle for around 48K before 7500 credit.  Yeah it still uses fuel beyond 42 miles EV only range, but for all that comes with it for the price... I cancelled my model Y order and am now strongly considering the RAV4 prime.  Not as fast, won't be as fun...but certainly more practical in most respects from where I'm sitting."
"Of course there's a comparison. If you want a good sized small SUV for driving to and from work or school, there's a comparison. 

Most people don't care about the wow factor. They need a vehicle."
I agree with your point that it‚Äôs not a good review but it does presents different angles to give you concept of size. That‚Äôs all I was trying to share üòä
"It is a bad review, because it is not intended to be review.  Just like saying it is a bad cat, because it is not a cat."
"Please name the materials involved in your opinion.

Which ones on the Tesla Model Y are inferior?"
"Yes, but $. And also some people just aren‚Äôt ready to give up ICE. 

Range, infrastructure, home charging, etc. And of course, build quality."
"We have a MY now, but our last car was a RAV4.  The RAV4 has a little more space in the back, but other than that, they're not even comparable.  The MY is more comfortable, handles like a dream, is way nicer looking both inside and out, and of course it has all that tech that the RAV4 won't have for another ten years."
i was set on a model Y but not i‚Äôm reconsidering after the RAV4 Prime. The Rav4 would have more flexibility for longer road trips but the tech in the MY is really something i want
"Well, sure, there is a comparison in that they're both CUVs. 

But their price points are quite different so people shopping for Model Y may save $ and go to Toyota Rav4 Prime but people shopping for Toyota Rav4 Prime might not be ready to spend the additional $20k (60% more) for the Y. 

So right off the bat, the comparison stops for people starting from Toyota budget/monetary perspective"
"I can‚Äôt go into specifics and maybe it‚Äôs more of a QC thing but not only does the Tesla look cheaper, and no I‚Äôm not talking about the minimalistic style, but it‚Äôs just not built as well. Seeing posts of people with back seats falling apart, tools found inside seats, dirty handprints, peeling paint etc is unacceptable for a car in its price range. 
I was fully on board with a Tesla purchase until I dug a little deeper. It‚Äôs a 20k car masquerading as a premium car solely because of tech."
Good point. An affordable Toyota with Tesla guts would sell.
"You specifically said the materials used in the Model Y are inferior, even compared to a RAV4. Back that statement up."
Rav4 Prime is gonna be the tits.
"Ok I‚Äôll rephrase my statement. They LOOK inferior. It‚Äôs a 60k car but looks like a 20k car. I‚Äôm not researching what materials are used. I bet the RAV has real leather though, but I understand why Tesla doesn‚Äôt use real leather."
"Equating to a 20K car is crazy.  This has a completely revolutionary 21st  interior, that everyone is now copying.  The RAV4 interior is so meh.  The 3/Y seats are well recognised to be crazy comfortable.  The fabric for the seats is also top quality, real leather is for your living room at best.  Proably only good in your vintage MG convertible.  Have a drive of a M3 or Y before you make any comments"
But what do you even mean the materials look inferior. The points you brought up were about dirtiness or delivery problems. Still nothing to do with the car.
Is that color a wrap?
but panel gaps! tail light sticks out! undriveable! lmao give me a break
unplugged <3
"Also want to know this. Been looking for the perfect blue that's not satin or matte, and that looks like it"
"But 0-60 times, lmao give me a break"
Yes this is a wrap :)
 yeah that's important to me
But what color???
KPMF Indulgent Blue aka Unplugged Electric Blue
Why would someone downvote this tweet that I‚Äôm sharing for anyone who might be interested. I‚Äôm not even voicing an opinion on the tweet.
"When stuff like this happens do a system reboot. Think computer, not car."
This guy is popular on YouTube. He‚Äôs a huge Tesla fan. So sad that he seems to have gotten a lemon. Lots of issues.
I had the same issue but the techs took a week to come to the same conclusion as the one in the video. At least I have a model x loaner
"""Current Autopilot experience, because even after the repair, a hard reset, and closing my front trunk multiple times properly, my Model Y always thinks the front trunk is open. Infuriating. @Tesla @elonmusk ""

In the tweet he said he did hard restarts and even took into get serviced though?
Missed that one. I wouldn‚Äôt try the one where you take off the back seat‚Äî-let the service center do it.
I think I might cry! Lol
Funny! Because of the glare it looks like it‚Äôs regular chrome
"exact config I have. Can't wait, ordered last march 2019"
Those look like induction wheels too which is surprising.  I thought it was all gemini right now.
Looks great!
I swear the real tire looks smaller than the front on the Y.
Sure looks like no chrome delete üôÅ. I hope that is just sun glare.
I‚Äôm not crying you‚Äôre crying!! üò≠üò≠üò≠
Does the Y have chrome delete?
Did you get a text a couple days ago?
Lots just opting for Gemini for the comfort.
It‚Äôs tape!
Yep! This picture just has tape on it because i guess that‚Äôs how they are shipped
"Yes, says 2-4 weeks they expect it to be ready for delivery. Just hope they don't jack these up trying to smash them out so quick for quarter end"
"Im waiting for my Model Y... Why is the gemini option more comfortable? (I chose induction for the sheer purpose of I liked the look, but if there are other factors, I might change my mind)"
I‚Äôm with you. I‚Äôm worried when they rush anything that costs me $60k just to get their quarterly numbers up
"Small rims so thicker tires, which translates to a smoother ride.  They are also all season tires vs summer tires on the induction. It‚Äôs the same reason lots prefer Aero wheels on the M3."
Needed to hear this. Thanks!
Thanks. This is encouraging.
"I so needed to read this. I am tentatively scheduled to take delivery this Friday and the negativity is killing me. 

&#x200B;

Thank you again.

Picking mine up on Friday and this gives me hope.
"Very happy to hear of the positive experience at Littleton.  I picked up my M3 in 2018 there during the crazy rush in the final days of the full federal tax credit and the experience was great, if a bit rushed.  Hoping for good luck on my white/white LR AWD Y whenever I get assigned a VIN!  

Also, if you haven't already, please join us in the [Denver Tesla Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/902089643268988) group on Facebook!"
I don't have Facebook but I have already joined the club :) pretty bummed I couldn't make the drive on the 20th though!
