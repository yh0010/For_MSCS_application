"Post locked:  People can’t be nice, it’s not hard."
Has anyone here disconnected from the grid completely with the use of Powerwalls?
Nice 3-pack.
This what peak performance looks like.
All i noticed in this photo was Bill Nyes calves
What exactly is the Tesla battery grid?
Does he really need three though
"I'm at 65% with 2 powerwalls. With net metering I pay for less than 20% of my power. I may consider adding 1 more. 

EDIT: Typo - two power walls is what I have. Adding 1 more would likely get me to neutral annually due to net metering. "
"That's exactly the right message, Bill!"
How much sex junk can that power?

"Fuck Bill Nye and his bad show.

Coming from a former fan.

Yay Tesla and renewable energy. Yay awareness of important issues.

Boo bad Netflix series with condescending ""science"" ""experts"" ""debating"" issues that Bill or his production company has deemed truth.

Yes, climate change is real. We wouldn't be watching your fucking show if we thought otherwise. Your condescending presentation is not appealing, and forcing social issues into a ""science"" show is absurd.

Instead of dancing guests screeching about their genitals, why not just explain the science behind sexual arousal and preferences?! The show is a circus, and it sucks now.

I almost feel like he's trying to push people away from critical thought. Imagine if you found out Mr. Rodgers was an ax murderer-- that's how I feel about Bill. Such potential to reach a broader audience and he fucked it up by appealing to... Anyone? Did anybody actually enjoy his Netflix reboot?

Fuck this guy."
\*slaps top of box\* this bad boy can fit so much fucking science in it
"“‘Cause my sex junk is so much mo-o-ore than just either o-o-or.”

Woa. Really makes me think. Dude science lmao."
I need this. Every time the wind blows too hard in my area the power fails. Solar won't work due to snow but I would hope it would charge off a small generator. Three is a bit much however I would just stop my welding projects until I was back on grid.
What gender pronoun does his powerwall prefer to be called?
I don't like bill anymore. He's taken the blue pill.
"that has to be a ton of $$$, and just sitting outside?  what am is missing here?  couldn't someone just hoist that thing and carry it off?  asking for a friend"
BILL!
is it male or female? 
"Ever since his disastrous AMA on Reddit I can't stand to look at that guy.  
  
Not even a real scientist. Such a shame."

"2 years until these start getting stolen.  Only reason I say 2 years is because of the time for more houses to get them.  People walk into houses and strip them off all their copper, people pull out air conditioners out of windows.  Why not spend a few minutes stealing.... what is that $18k?"

I hate when people bitch about him being a fake scientist. He's talked about how they had this idea to show kids on an educational tv show these representations of science principles that were fun and engaging. The fog machines and prop lab coat didn't tip you off it was entertainment? He realized science had an important roll in the future and engaged with kids to get them interested. He did as much good for the world with a kids program as Mr Rogers did. My one complaint would be that Netflix show that he pushed some really obsurd social justice warrior shit on an innocent 27 year old that just wanted to see Bill Nye the Science Guy again :( I hope he sold his soul for a big ass check for that one lol {BILL BILL Bill bill ..... bill...}

[deleted]
Although I know Mr Nye has gone downhill recently in public opinion (including my opinion of him) I know he and his family live near me and I know someone who’s friends with his niece and I always secretly hope he calls my company for electrical work I would love to hook up a Tesla battery grid to his electrical panel but I know it will never happen 
"I have a house completely off grid. Don't use a powerwall though. Have a set of deep cycle gel cell batteries connected to a solar cell array. Have gas cylinders for cooking and hot water, rainwater tank for water and a septic system. We run fridge, TV and lights without much problem. Occasionally when there is a few days without sunshine, we have to top up with a generator. "
"With Powerpack, yes.  http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-27/massive-tesla-battery-to-power-logan-reservoir/8993474

With a Model S battery pack, yes (Rep. Massie of KY). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpPYkqpe-Ms

Unsure of Powerwall."
"Yes, but only for 11 hours (due to a power outage).  


Theoretically the Powerwalls could be used off-grid, but there are some edge cases that prevent it from being practical. In particular, there is no way to start a depleted Powerwall without a grid present, and there is no way to charge a Powerwall from a generator.  


During the summer, I could flip my main breaker and disconnect from the grid completely, but during the winter I'd have trouble bridging cloudy weeks. In practice Net-Energy Metering makes it more advantageous to stay connected to the grid and just use the Powerwalls to help avoid using peak rate power on my time-of-use plan."
"They're currently only approved for grid tied installations, iirc"
Aren't these more along the idea of becoming Idependent of the grid? 
"To supply your house with Powerwalls you would need at least 2 powerwalls to meet your energy demand (2*13.5kWh = 27kWh) a typical household energy demand is between 20 and 30kWh.

To then go off grid you would need a 8kW or larger solar array to charge the batteries. A smaller array wouldn’t charge your batteries fast enough to have enough energy to supply your house. Also assuming adequate sunshine every day of the year.

So it is possible but a the moment very expensive and limited by roof size and available sunshine."
"My sister is still on the grid, but only because her solar system generates a surplus and she gets paid to share."
Yup. We have 3 powerwalls plus solar panels. Completely off grid unless we have a few days of rain.
Going to need a a large area for 12kw+ of solar
I can confirm and the answer is yes

Solar battery which stores excess energy for when you need it most - ie an outage 
Honestly probably the ideal amount to have. Especially with a larger house. 
"Yes..... if you want any chance of actually running an A/C unit or charging your tesla quickly without tapping back into the grid or in the event of power outage. A single powerwall can only provide 5kW continuous (7kW peak) so if you want one or two AC units to actually work or alternatively even be able to charge your Tesla at a reasonable rate; you better have 3-4 powerwalls. Most people don't realize how complicated all this stuff actually ends up being to make it practical and useful. You really can't just slap a few solar panels and a powerwall on any residence and expect it to suddenly to be energy independent or even effective at producing the desired result; House size and climates and energy needs are drastically different and you must scale to meet needs accordingly. In the event you do want to undersize your powerwall needs, you need to rewire the utility boxes so that only lights and small appliances run on the solar/battery and ac units and large appliances only work when grid is available... it gets really complex (and expensive) unfortunately."
Mega solar roof for Tesla coil parties!
Three makes the most sense for every person who owns a house and has 12kW+ solar generation potential.

"Yeah, everything about Bill in recent years has really made me sour on him. Still love the Science Guy though."
He also ripped off startalk completely with a shitty studio setup that has no function or soul. 
"I get it though... Like sure you shouldn't be that way toward people but when you spend your life dedicated to science just to have a bunch of ignorant twats tell you you're wrong and try to ""debate"" you on hard facts. I can see where you can easily turn into an ahole to people.

Source- Am currently running out of shits to give for stupid people."
"I feel the exact same way. I always loved that he seemed like an approachable person who brought science into the lives of millions of children. His new show was awful. He had zero respect for anyone on his ""panels"" unless they shared his viewpoint. Yes, some of them were blatently wrong, but someone who claims to represent science should still back up their claims with empirical evidence and well reasoned arguments. His show would never get anyone to change sides on any of the issues they covered."

What are your estimated savings? Improvements already paid for themselves?
"From link #1:

> The massive 95kWh Tesla PowerPack battery is the first to be installed in Australia, and comes amid a wave of support for solar-powered batteries among Australian households.
>Three hundred and twenty-three solar panels have been installed on the roof of the Logan reservoir to collect sunlight to be stored in the battery.
>The technology will allow the reservoir to provide safe drinking water residents south of Logan 24 hours a day and is expected to service 200,000 people when the region is fully developed.

Interesting that they phrased 95kWh as ""massive' haha"
And after allllllll use your powerwalllllll
What about Wonderwall?
Tesla? You overpaid!!!
"> Yes, but only for 11 hours (due to a power outage).

My hydro company won't allow me to switch between grid and gen power.  I can either have grid-tied solar where I sell the excess to the power company and remain grid-tied indefinitely, *or* I can disconnect completely and permanently if I want to use the solar with batteries for myself.

The reason is that they don't trust any of the automatic switches yet, and they need to be absolutely certain my electricity won't backfeed into the grid when it's not supposed to and electrocute their linemen trying to fix a blackout.  Hell even without an automatic switch, they still have warning signs on every single utility pole on my street specifically because of my solar panels."
Could you explain why you can't charge from a generator and why you can't start one without a grid?
"From the website: ""If you are in a remote area without access to utility power, Powerwall and solar can offer an off-grid solution."""
It's illegal to have a house totally off the grid in some areas.

I'm not sure that really makes sense unless you live in a place that has a really unreliable grid or the energy company doesn't buy back electricity.
"They're designed to be mounted to walls, inside and out."
"Power company has to buy my excess production at $0.11 per kilowatt hour. My system works by recharging the two powerwalls with the excess power from the panels, then switches to selling it back to the utility company. Usually the powerwalls are fully charged around 11am to noon, so from about noon to 5pm I am selling back power."

"Dude, you just don't believe in climate change. That's it. Why don't you talk to scientists and actual smart people about it, rather than random redditors? You're either going to be debating idiots who vehemently disagree with you or idiots who agree with you.

Believe it or not, you're as subject to bias as anyone else. Your name is literally based on Bill Nye's dumb show that no one cared about after a month, and it makes it obvious you're a conservative. Not that that's a bad thing, just saying it's obvious.

I'm not insulting you here. If you **legitimately** want scientific progress or to understand the situation, you should pore through the information yourself and throw away all biases. You certainly aren't unbiased, my friend.

On a similar note, I've not legitimately seen a ""climate skeptic"" on the internet. They all have been just plain climate change deniers. Isn't denying climate change entirely just as ""settled"" as assuming it's true? And I just don't really see much info about it not being a thing.

"I don't know, he didn't mention AC so that might be a sweaty handjob. "
"Sounds compelling, /u/PortlyFilthyAss"
"Well the place where I have it doesn't have grid connected electricity available, so no choice. However I'd say that even if it was we'd have paid it off by now (18 years). "
"Yeah, that’s not in anyway massive.  Not by today’s standards. "
"Not trying to be a smart ass but, possibly they meant size. Idk it’s all relative haha"
Ya when it can’t even charge the largest size model S. 
"Yeah that's ""only"" like 10,000 18650s approximating at 10Wh each, which is around the same number they put in their cars"
"I have one question on this that I have not been able to get an answer on for some time. What is the difference between solar and a generator. They could both use the same ATS, so why can one run without grid power while the other cannot."
"Basically the generator is (currently) only supported as a backup to the Powerwalls after the Powerwalls run out of energy: [https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/learn/powerwall/generator-integration](https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/learn/powerwall/generator-integration)  


The issue with starting a PV/Powerwall system when it's depleted is that the solar inverter won't start without power to sync to, so if the Powerwall is dead, the system won't start up even after the sun rises again.  


Both of these issues seem solvable. The Powerwall firmware could have an emergency reserve after which it shuts down and then tries to restart in the morning when the sun is up. Presumably Tesla could design a charger for the Powerwalls that could take power from a generator rather than just using the generator as a backup. It's just like many other things on Tesla's roadmap (such as FSD) that we don't know how long it will take them to actually get to them and whether the current hardware will support it."
"They eventually will support this, but note that in the specs ([https://www.tesla.com/powerwall](https://www.tesla.com/powerwall)) it says ""coming soon."" Given how long the wait for time-based control was, I would not hold my breath for this."
Are they actually installing off-grid now?  This is good news!  They used to say no - there's a state governor that uses a Model S battery for his off-grid storage home's power because Tesla wouldn't let him just buy off-grid power walls.
My bad
"Looking at you Florida. I'd have just my porch light connected to my city mains, just to be a cunt."
Why would anyone want to be fully disconnected anyway? Just throw the main breaker and it's the same as not being connected. Big deal.  Any house not on the grid would suffer loss of property value anyways because the vast majority obviously want that connection.

My middle school science teacher approached him at a conference prior to 2000 and apparently Bill Nye was an asshole to him. Teacher was the nicest man alive and it must have been bad enough to warrant telling a class of 12 year olds.

I don’t need a degree in culinary arts to cook or teach someone else about cooking so......
"I'm tired of people who use this argument to disregard him. A Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering doesn't define his knowledge of science.

"Generators can't backfeed with a proper ATS. Grid-tie backfeeds on purpose.

You could wire a solar system like a backup generator, but then you can't use grid and solar power at the same time, or sell extra energy.

A safe way to automatically switch between grid-tie and off-grid might be possible to design. Or it could switch to off-grid during a power outage and you have to manually reconnect it to the grid after you confirm with the power company that it's ready."
"The solar inverter is a grid-sync inverter that’s designed to inject power onto an AC wave coming from the grid. It can’t generate it’s own waveform. The Powerwall inverter by contrast can generate an AC waveform that the solar inverter can then sync too.

I assume that with the right generator you could generate a waveform good enough for the solar inverter, but the inverter probably assumes that it can dump excess power into the grid. Without the grid or batteries to take the excess power, you’d have a problem. "
I'm not sure if generator ATSes are approved either. It's toronto hydro if you're curious.
"Honest question, could you hook up say, a car battery and get enough juice to get it started again? Or a gas generator? I may be fundamentally lacking knowledge here, I admit."

"ahhh, good point. Yeah, seeing as they're still taking years to delivery these things, I don't think they're chomping at the bit to add more niche functionality to them. "
"I don't actually know if they are, I just pulled that from their website. It's possible the site and reality don't match up. But I don't think there's any reason you couldn't use it off grid from a technical standpoint. I know it's illegal to have an off-grid inhabitance in Florida, so I guess it wouldn't work here :-("
"So I thought this was the case due to some news reports I saw, but then I was informed on Reddit that this isn't true. You do need to get the automatic disconnect switch though, and you would of course need to have enough battery to weather the largest power swing you want, so it's kind of silly to bother if your provider doesn't charge instantaneous rates. Mine doesn't, so I just produce excess power in the day and use their power at night or whenever else, and the grid modulates the power for me. In an emergency, I'd need a generator, but these aren't expensive comparatively if I cared to maintain one. "

The thing about climate change is that the solutions liberals come up with to fight it are so bad.

Solar and wind will never cut it especially when gas is phased out by electricity as the fuel for transportation.

Not even close.

Even within the trans community many transpeople do not believe there are more than 2 genders.

"They would have to be,at least for commercial, there a lot of vital buildings that need backup power. An ATS is much safer than relying on two breakers because then it is physically possible to have both breakers shit at once."
"I really don't see why not, so long as you turn it into AC at the correct input voltage (up-convert the voltage, or use many batteries in series to achieve the same) and frequency that your mains is."
"Sure, if the Powerwall had a charging input and the car supported something like V2G (vehicle to grid).  The point is Tesla would have to make modifications to the system to allow that to work. "
I don’t think it was overlooked. It’s just not a priority if all you need to do is to provide backup power during grid outages because eventually the grid will come back and restart everything. I’m guessing they’ll have some approach to dealing with this scenario when they officially support off-grid usage.

"Edit: I’m deleting the snarky comment I just posted.

I think you’re trying to argue someone shouldn’t be an advocate that isn’t an absolute expert in the field.

My mom shouldn’t argue that all people deserve healthcare and that our system doesn’t provide for poor people because she is an accountant. Bill Nye shouldn’t be an advocate for greater science literacy because he studied engineering at Cornell and developed systems for the Boeing 747. 

That’s how you sound when you argue he shouldn’t be a science advocate. Bill Nye doesn’t go around the world claiming how great *he* is. He goes around talking about great *science* is. He may have helped a generation of young people discover a passion for science. What’s wrong with that?"
"I'm not sure if you're being serious or not, but it takes a 5 second Google search to find the information that turned off a lot of people.

"I mean that’s a really complex argument that you can’t compact into that summary, you’d really have to read the research behind it to understand it; something I have not done myself but have came across a similar topic. In one of my clinical psychology courses in uni we analyzed cases where “straight” women physically abused by their fathers could only get pleasure from men if they would physically hurt them during sex, so they often turned to women. i put it in parenthesis because sexuality is not black or white, it’s more a continuum. so certain experiences may trigger the pursuit of other sexual desires that may have been repressed. thanks for pointing it out, im gonna look into it more since i was one of those kids who thought was straight until i had a certain experience. 

edit: but, I certainly understand that Bill shouldn’t expect to make those general claims and not piss off people. But i also understand that not most people would have the patient to listen to the reasoning. "

"Doesn’t he believe in that bullshit that there’s like 42 genders or some shit? I don’t think “most academics” believe that, dawg. "
"There are only 2 sexes. (aside from intersex of course, which I'm sure we can all agree is an aberration)

Gender is not sex.

Gender is *heavily* influenced by sex.

Gender is indeed a social construct. And the expected behavior of certain sexes (gender role) can vary heavily depending on the culture.

Being ""transgender"" (identifying more with the gender of the opposite sex) does not require a pronoun change, a name change, a hormone change, a clothes change, or a genitalia change in order to execute.

Since all of those things have to do with someone's *sex* instead of their *gender*.

If you were born a male in the US, and you like to work ""clean"" jobs, you like the idea of nurturing a family, and you're more interested in feelings than pure logic that doesn't necessitate any change to your outward identity to feel content. You will deviate from the norm for your sex, but that's fine.

I am a male as described above, and i feel no need to change any part of my appearance or identity to match the sex that is traditionally expected to have these traits in our society. If you do feel that need, we are talking about Gender Dysphoria and that's a mental disorder.

Even the APA agrees, ""gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.""

Gender dysphoria is a mental disorder and should be treated as such. There is no indication that this mental disorder is in anyway ""normal"" and treating as such does a disservice to those who suffer from it. Most mental illnesses have no known cure yet. And I truly think we'll look back on things like HRT and transition surgery as a barbaric way to treat the symptoms of a disease instead of it's cause.

*That* is how most academics feel on the subject.

You don’t even need to take that many science courses to get an engineering degree at most schools.

That’s not to take anything away from engineers. They work in a domain that’s extraordinarily useful and necessary. But someone with an engineering background calling himself a scientist is like a PhD biologist calling himself a medical doctor. There’s overlap, but they’re completely different roles."

"Most solar panels are manufactured overseas. 

So they get made in countries with little-to-no pollution controls, put on trucks and shipped to ports, put on cargo vessels and shipped to the US, put on trucks and shipped to warehouses, put on different trucks and shipped to stores, then put in a family vehicle and brought home.

A primary component is also gallium, which is mined primarily in Asia and is a byproduct of coal. 

Not saying that solar is bad, but nuclear is more efficient and not as environmentally unsound as solar, though to be fair solar is making great improvements. "
That's a good point.
"I mean, there *is* such a thing as genuine virtue-signalling, where people espouse views they do not actually hold so as to gain social credence, *but* it is *far* less common than those who *complain* about it say that it is.

To be sure, genuine signallers are annoying as hell, but in my opinion the complainers are just as, if not more annoying and virulent, because they use it as licence to be assholes. Indeed, their own rejection of virtue-signalling is a form of it itself, but of the inverse; they signal a *lack* of virtue. Most amusing, in its own way, but also destructive."

I don't think that represents anyone's opinion.

Thank you
"I'm literally disagreeing with *you* though. (at least the position I thought you were taking)

The gender dysphoria that leads people to transition or consider themselves ""transgender"" is a mental disorder, not a legitimate reason to seek to change any part of their identity or body to conform to societal standards.

Did I misunderstand what you were implying with your initial post?"
Nuclear is a great middle ground. Because it's not 10x as expensive and it's more efficient and produces far more power than any other source.

"Not immediately buying wholesale idea that gender is a ""spectrum"" despite the fact that psychology is an extremely soft science as is, and that sexuality is one of the most nebulous topics therein = intolerant. Got it. We can't even accurately measure intelligence or personality, but we're supposed to buy that ""the gender spectrum"" is a highly researched and widely agreed upon theory? There has been next to no research on the benefits of pushing ""the gender spectrum"" in the first place, for all we know the theory just makes people even more neurotic, but if we don't want to teach our kids that they have to choose where they fall on ""the gender spectrum"" when they can't even figure out how they want to present themselves in public then we're suddenly ""bigots."" By the way, the definition of bigotry is ""intolerance for ideas other than one's own,"" such as the opinion that the gender spectrum is unscientific claptrap that exists to make pseudo-progressives feel good about themselves.

"And his career now is entertainment, neither science or engineering."
"He didn't work at Boeing for very long, not long enough to do any serious research. Since then he's been in tv as a children's entertainer. He's also designed some neat sundials, but has no publications to his name besides some children's books. So he's a tv host who writes books for kids and engineers sundials. Does that mean he can't be up to date on current scientific research? No, but it also doesn't grant him any authority on anything either"
"I think his point is that he isn't a practicing engineer anymore. If a person got a PhD at the age of 30, then worked at McDonalds for 40 years, would you really consider this person an expert or even competent in their field still?

Same goes for engineering, or any other career. Bill changed his career long ago.

Also, to be officially considered an engineer, I believe you need a P.E. (For legal purposes at least)"
"That's not akin to that. That would make sense if he would have said a Cornell alumnus with a BS in Mechanical Engineering still doesn't make him a bachelor (academic definition).

It's about his career that he could have been and studied in for more than just a few years, not the degree."
I never made it that far 
Bill Nye said sex and gender are two different things. That's literally all I stated and you stated it too.

"Haha yeah, I do it for the uhhh, ~~laziness~~ efficiency! But yeah exactly, if you have enough towels, you could just toss one in the hamper and use another one until the hamper fills up. "
use it as a wash cloth once a week.  let air dry.  now you have a clean hand towel. 
"Wait, you wash them weekly? Is that a thing? Maybe I should wash them more often!"
"Oh wait it's just for hand towels? Lol I thought it was like a Dyson airblade and you just walked through it to dry off your whole body :p

I guess nevermind then. I mean theoretically I could wait for one more dirty large towel instead of washing the hand towels in, but idk now it makes less sense. "
Can't tell if sarcasm.
"woah, no energy required at all for washing towels.  Each one is just incidently washed with the others for no extra energy.

He doesn't claim to have any authority - he says that the people with that authority hold certain views..... 
"He supposedly would have had that considering he worked at Boeing and invented a ""hydraulic resonance suppressor tube"" for them. He had a career change obviously but this whole semantic war is just people grasping at straws to discredit him because they don't like his message but lack the ability to actually debunk what he said that upset them."
"> After graduating from Cornell, Nye worked as an engineer for the Boeing Corporation and Sundstrand Data Control near Seattle. While at Boeing, he invented a hydraulic resonance suppressor tube used on Boeing 747 airplanes.

Either way even if he studied something unrelated it doesn't matter because he has a team of scientists and academics working for him to verify what he says."
"You said most academics agree with Bill on gender.

That's not true. While they are obviously separate things, Bill implies that gender is defined by the individual when it is actually a construct of society.

Gender is a highly accurate generalization of the roles the sexes tend to prefer in a culture, gender is applied to someone externally. You are *told* what gender you are, you don't choose.

Gender identity is correct phrase for the internal relation to ones external gender / gender roles.

Bill also states that someone can have no gender (not true unless the culture itself promotes no genders / roles which is not the case anywhere as far as I am aware) and that gender can exist on a spectrum (also not true, since gender specifically defines the roles traditionally associated with one of the two sexes.) Your gender identity can borrow from both sexes, but that doesn't mean you become a new thing. If I take some fruit (male gender role) and place it in my bag (gender identity) and then take a vegetable (female gender role) and place it in my bag, I don't have a bag full of some third, yet to be defined substance.

I have both fruits and vegetables in my bag


EDIT: I see I've managed to confuse and piss off both sides of this debate. Nuance is rough, and harder than just buying into a belief system wholesale. Don't take my word for any of this, do your own research, but actually do it before forming an opinion."
Exactly
How long are you using towels
Haha. Here I was thinking I was using less than most people.
It's really not necessary. If you just use them to towel off after a shower the only thing they're coming into contact with is your freshly cleaned body.

Because dryers use more energy based on how much water content theyre drying.........
..... dryers use more energy if their temperature is lowered by water in more and more towels... good try though.

What? I’m not even being rude to you let alone claiming I’m a victim as well. Look I don’t agree with you on this particular issue but you need to lighten up and stop acting so defensive when people aren’t even attacking you. 
"Working as an engineer doesn't mean that you have a P.E. It's something you have to pass, through a test and work experience. You also have to maintain it. I don't believe he's ever had one based on a quick google search



Also, whether it's a semantic war or not, I think it is clear that one of the two things is true:

1.) The word engineer is meaningless, so whenever someone says ""He's an engineer""... It means absolutely nothing. The word engineer isn't for those with an engineering degree... it's literally just a job title. You have sales engineers, train engineers, security engineers. Many of which don't even hold engineering degrees. Yet they can still call themselves engineers because the word ""engineer"" alone isn't a protected title. That's why we have things like P.E. which is a protected title

2.) He isn't an engineer because he isn't working as an engineer.

Would  be cool if it worked with the Model 3’s key card and you could personalize the car. 
So how does this work? Does it just recognize the card format and the Tesla name?

It is pretty nice. But isn’t it kind of useless in a real world environment because the person scanning the business card needs to have the right app installed and most people won’t? It’d be a lot more useful if it would work with major apps that a lot of people have on their phone but this is going to be extremely difficult and or expensive of course. 
Life changing.
What app is needed to see this?

Oh that is what would make this cool? Damn you are hard to please. Your parents must have hated buying you presents. 
Yes
An AR app I used before let you draw your own design and when it recognized the drawing it would place whatever model on it. So I assume it just recognizes the Tesla logo and it programmed to place the car on it. I think that if you pointed that app at any Tesla logo that it would put a car on it. 
"There's apps like sketchfab  or augment that let's you do this with any model imaginable, even your own. You can also program it to recognize any specific flat surface. This works the same way."
Probably something similar to the SIFT algorithm. It uses an image of the logo to know what to track

Do you have to wear any special glasses to see it or everyone can see it with their naked eyes? I see that you can move the card around. So it's not like a projection from a camera? How far away can you move the card?
"But that app only has the other car?

Edit: It Works!!!"
Tesla makes that app? How do an ordinary app recognizes tesla’s card?
Used it to order a Model 3. Thank you.
"NO! We use a “expired CC auto update” service for our company. We are able to automatically update expired cards to their new cards, about 40% of the time. This happens when you update your CC on PayPal or etc, they sell that info to anyone else who has the original expired card number, and a subscription billing agreement "
"You'd think that an expired card is useless... but it can still be charged in various circumstances at various sites.

I had my card used fraudulently once, and they went 10k over my credit limit and it was approved... I asked the CC why they approved it, and they said, it's more of a ""guideline"".

You should explicitly ask them to disable it, although maybe that happened when you activated the new one?"
"Hopefully its a different number than the last. Expired cards don't typically issue new numbers, just new date."
holy shit. some OC!!!!
"*Look at that subtle white accent. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh my God, its even VR capable.*"

"not really. AR kits are free, they surely have a 3D model of their cars and they do show the state of the car in app already, just in a picture, not in a 3D model. Even with the possibility of a control of a car, this can’t take more than few months for one guy, as it’s just implementing a framework, nothing new"
That’s me

I appreciate and enjoy the verbose and overwrought nature of *your* response. 
Yes
Vuforia and ARKit (iOS) have this capability and I believe ARCore (Android) might as well but I've never used it. Basically you can designate a specific image to track and when it detects that object you can have a 3d model appear. I've done it before with Vuforia and ARKit. These AR business cards are becoming a lot more popular. 
"Sorry I didn’t reply earlier, I looked it up and it was called Augment - 3D Augmented Reality"
I work with them! They're super awesome
[ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/arkit/) composites 3D objects onto your phone screen. No glasses needed. It is pretty amazing tech.
You can see it through the screen. That's augmented reality. There is no projection in the real world.
ARKit is easy to work with on iOS.
Performance Model I hope!

"Yep. Vuforia is great albeit crazy expensive for simple stuff.

Takes longer for the iOS build to run than to set up a business card AR app in Unity these days "
But isn’t it kind of useless in a real world environment because the person scanning the business card needs to have the right app installed?
The Android version is terrible though.

"I was referring to the ratings, which weren't looking so good."
"This was going to be a reply to the other comment that has since been deleted, but it works just as well as a standalone:

People (dumbasses) aren't expecting handicapped drivers to have nice cars.  They mentally equate ""handicapped"" with ""minivan with wheelchair ramps.""

If only they knew how absolutely killer the Driver Profile system and adjustable air suspension are for getting in and out of the car while handicapped."
"Didn't expect my five minutes of fame to reach the internet, but here we are. Some explanation though; personally i wasn't bullied (allthough someone else was) and i've been wanting this plate since the system for personal plates was available. The case mentioned was initially brought up on the norwegian Tesla group. One owner mentioned he got some rude remarks when he parked (with a placard) and stepped out in a disabled spot when his wife (who is disabled) was with him in the car.  

Not everyone is comfortable with the position they're in or with their disability, and remarks like these can have huge implications for some people. Personally i'm comfortable where i am, which is also why i agreed to front the case [in the media](https://www.nrk.no/vestfold/blir-utskjelt-pa-hc-parkeringer-pa-grunn-av-fin-bil-1.14117881) and have recieved exclusively positive feedback on it as it has started some talks here and there with regards to the stereotypes of being disabled and how to break them. Personally [i'm a huge car-nut,](https://i.imgur.com/VqvrGLU.png) so i've used this (and now the plate) to show that disabled people also can have [""normal"" interests like these.](https://i.imgur.com/E3jreCv.png)

I have also gotten some remarks, usually not rude, but they either turn away quickly or apologize as i start to unpack the chair. As for the plate it was applied for before this was ever a case. Several of my friends who are disabled drive nice or ""unassuming"" cars, everything from my friends' [American muscle](https://i.imgur.com/XFvErVz.png) with [adaptions](https://i.imgur.com/E8Lh3n0.png) to Teslas, or other (personal) [fun toys](https://i.imgur.com/kPWQuw9.png) with [varions adaptions.](https://imgur.com/a/n9FJj)"
"This was a follow-up Facebook-picture after an article at a Norwegian web site. The article is about people with nicer cars getting rude comments for using handicapped parking. He answers by changing his license plate to (in his own words): “avoid confusion”.

[Original article(Norwegian)](https://www.nrk.no/vestfold/blir-utskjelt-pa-hc-parkeringer-pa-grunn-av-fin-bil-1.14117881)"
"Interesting.  Norway has only had personalized license plates since June 15, 2017."
Why was he bullied though. I mean Whats wrong with owning a tesla and being handicapped
"Handicapped girl here with a model X. Fuck all those people. I’ve never been harassed but I’m sure people have wanted to. I felt super awkward getting my plates when I bought my Model x. Almost like I was ashamed because of what another commenter said, it wasn’t a minivan. "

"Still can't forget the day I picked up my brand new car and drove to pick up my heavily disabled father for a ride.


Whilst driving he asked if we could pick up a few items from the food store.

He had good blue badge (this is what we have in the UK for authorisation to park in handicapped spaces).

We go into the store for five minutes and return to a long, thick, deep key mark from front light, all the way down the panel to the rear cluster.

My dad hobbled in and I drove off absolutely gutted how people can behave like that. "
What a bad ass.. 
[deleted]
"My mom is disabled and has a handicap pass that she uses on her company car. She tries not to use handicap spots unless there is no other parking available or the available parking is too far away for her to endure. She gets nasty looks all the time for parking a car with company logos on it in a handicap spot. Once, a passerby confronted her about it, claiming that disabled people don’t work. My mom’s response: “Are you my doctor? Then fuck off.” The lady called in to my mom’s company (the number is on the car) to complain and was told that if she had a problem with equal opportunity employment laws, she should write her Congressperson instead of harassing people. "
Can someone who owns a wheelchair and a model S shed some light on how you get in and out of the car?
"And it's Norway, so it's not even like Tesla's are rare luxury cars. They are everywhere. What a bunch of cunts bullying a handicapped guy cause he owns an expensive car."
"I can see where the confusion comes from. Some people with nice cars, or cars the owner thinks is nicer than it is, *cough BMW owners, will use the handicap parking just for extra space to prevent dings.

So seeing a nice car in the handicap spot people often jump to thinking it is one of those."
Physical capabilities have nothing to do with financial capabilities
"There is the human condition to equate anything different from you to be less than what you have. A disabled person is less than you is you can walk so there is the tendency to assume everything about that person is less than what you have including their ability to afford things. 

Humans are intrinsically assholes. But because we can think, we are able to become broad minded good people. 

But that's only if we choose to think."
Bully is jealous they don't own a Tesla honestly.
"Hell, I have handicapped plates on my motorcycle. 🤷‍♂️"
He answered getting bullied for being handicapped and driving a tesla with a picture of him being handicapped and driving a tesla? I don't get it. 
Do people think that handicapped = not rich or successful? Because that's a messed up perspective.
"So the issue is he has a disability and was harassed for having a nice car? Who...who gets upset about that? Insane people? But wouldn't they have handicapped placards too?!

edit [like this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zyNkSsA3-s)"
This pic is fucking swag as hell!!
Dude I work with has a modified Lexus.  Is paralyzed from hips down.  He is a director at the bank I work for.  Works lots and deserves all the nice things he can pay for.  Same with this guy.  Too many people get judgmental about crap that is none of their business. 
I know a lot of handicapped people drive BMWs as evidenced by their inability to use turn signals or follow simple traffic laws.
Where’s the part about him getting bullied?
What sort of spineless pleb thinks handicapped people can’t have a nice car?
"Wtf? what, since he's in a wheelchair he's not allowed to own cool shit and drive bad ass cars? Wtf is wrong with people?"
We are all handicapped ... some are just more visible than others .
Aww. Mad they can't afford it?

Way to go Adrian!
Does he drive it?
"Well, my aunt uses my grandmothers handicapped sticker. She drives a van. So maybe, the stigma of the handicapped = van is from people using other people’s stickers? "
why does the car matter if you have a handicapped license?
"The thing is, not all handicapped outwardly look handicapped. Regardless of the vehicle, people should not have to justify their disability."
How do you bully someone for having a new luxury car? I am confused to all hell
The license plate is pretty clear! Lol
Badassery. 
"If you drive a Tesla, you make more money than me and therefore can probably bully me on how poor I am.

This entire comment section is nauseating drivel. Sorry. I am not a troll. It just is. Sorry.

Is that an x or an S?  I feel an X would be better for disability access...and modifications.
"Lets be honest here, most of these people are jerks because they wish they could park there without a disability"
"Well a ""cripple"" is more successful than me. That's my answer."

Its also shitty to pull into a spot as a 25 Y/O disabled person with their child then i get stared at cause im “Too Young” or they cant visually see my disability. I have hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome all my connective tissues are garbage and my joints always hurt.
"Likewise, I love the people staring daggers at my mother when she gets out of her car in a handicap space. She's got legal plates and a placard. Totally normal looking woman on the outside, but she was diagnosed with Lupus over 10 years ago. She takes an oral steroid daily to help prevent inflammation, but sometimes she has days where her own body attacks her joints, tendons, and mucles. She's 61, and when she's having a bad day, it's hard to walk across a parking lot, aside from walking around in the store too. 

How about we play a game were we don't judge others, and if someone is breaking a law, let's let the police sort that out? Sheesh. "
"Concur. 

Am disabled, have Tesla. 

My small neighborhood must think I’m a drug dealer because fuck me if I’m able to actually earn enough money to pay for nice things. "
"Most people don’t realize, the signs depicting a person in a wheelchair doesn’t actually mean “handicapped.” 

It means the area is “accessible.” This can include a wide rand of things. Not just a physical disability.

"> If only they knew how absolutely killer the Driver Profile system and adjustable air suspension are for getting in and out of the car while handicapped.

Tbf lots of cars have those features, what sets the Tesla apart for me is the Autopilot suite which lets me, driving with only my hands, offload stress from those hands. The AP lets me drive twice as far as i normally would be able to, and with the ""forced"" rest stops while charging i drive three times further in a day than i was previously comfortable with. I can drive six hours to my grandmother and be alive, awake and chat, instead of dead-tired and head straight to bed."
"I suspect it was my comment you were replying to. I was skeptical of the headline because (a) it's clickbait-y wording, and (b) it made no sense to me that anybody would bully a handicapped person for owning a Tesla. It makes more sense after your explanation and after I think about it.

Perhaps also part of what's going on here also is general resentment of people who have something you don't, and cognitive dissonance of somebody who has something you don't also getting a ""free"" benefit. A lot of the discussion around tax credits for EVs also has this flavor to it.

Edit: After further reflection, I don' t really think this is it at all. I suspect the instinct/bias at play here is much, much worse than simple resentment. It's probably more about cognitive dissonance between ""high social status"" and disability. Disability is probably associated with poverty and other undesirable characterisics; I suspect it is far easier for people to summon up the image of ""Tiny Tim"" than to summon up the image of a high-status, independent person who also has a disability.

It makes me sad just to give voice to that idea, but I bet it's what's going on."
"
>People (dumbasses) aren't expecting handicapped drivers to have nice cars.  They mentally equate ""handicapped"" with ""minivan with wheelchair ramps.""

To add to this, people (dumbasses) might also assume that all disabled drivers are unable to work, ""so how can they afford a nice car?"" Or, they might assume that all disabled drivers receive assistance, so ""why are they spending it so frivolously?""

"
"A friend of mine is paralyzed from the waist down. Here he is at the track driving his [tricked out AWD VW.](https://imgur.com/6H1KR3q) 

He literally has to strap his legs in place when at the track so he doesn't slide around.

Most handicapped spots in the US are taken by senior citizens and the obese. Frequently someone with a true disability shows up and must park in normal spaces because all the others are taken up.

"People also don't expect Young people to be in wheelchairs, ive pulled up into a disabled spot to then have some cunt abuse me because im young and therefore dont need the spot to then run off when i pull my chair out. Some people are just assholes.

"> People (dumbasses) aren't expecting handicapped drivers to have nice cars.

there was a paraplegic guy in my city while i was growing up that had a twin turbo supra. i have to admit it caught me by surprise the fist time i saw it...i didn't even know that sort of thing was possible"
People assume that handicap spaces are for people only in wheelchairs too. My husband can't even make it through a 20 min shopping trip at the grocery store and gets yelled at by idiots who think he's just some guy borrowing a handicap tag. I'm a momma bear type so it pisses me off more than him. Incredibly infuriating.
"I think about my own prejudices when I see a nice car in a handicap zone and for me personally, I think my assumption is that it's just another rich bastard taking advantage of a handicapped zone more so than a handicapped driver not being able to drive a nice car.

 At least that's the 1st think of. Though I always check to see if there is a handicapped mirror hanger and if not then I keep my hostility running. "
"A guy I knew in the Porsche Club had a killer 911, ""GIMP"" as his customized license plate, and a handicapped parking permit.  He also had a special, small wheel chair that fit in the (front) trunk of the car.

It was awesome (as was he)."
He could have a semi and be handicapped still. Maybe he became handicapped after owning it. Or even richer people become handicapped. 'Tell him' to get with the program.
"It is indeed a dumbass thing to expect the minivan. It's a whole different level of dumbassery to fucking bother someone for not fitting into that image instead of saying ""huh"" and moving on."

Huh? More info if you can offer it."

"Not really. Problem is that SOMETIMES very rich people just don’t give a fuck about parking in an handicap spot because they can easily pay the ticket, so when you see a luxury car the probability that it belongs to a scumbag is actually higher, because they are more than actual rich handicapped people."
Wait if he can't walk then how tf can he drive ???
Biggest shock I have ever had was a pontiac grand amas a paraplegic car. 
My wheel chair buddy drives a Jeep. Goes off roading and hunting and works at the gun range. He also has a kitty who all his para friends love because she's not scared of their chairs and hops into laps. 
">   They mentally equate ""handicapped"" with ""minivan with wheelchair ramps.""

Uh, maybe sometimes, but I'm pretty sure it's ""how can this handicapped person being making more money than me? They're probably abusing disability benefits!"""
Interesting. What are the accessibility capabilities of the Model S or Tesla?
Have you seen the minivans? So sweet!
"Don't call other people dumbasses when you call disabled people handicapped.  Handicapped is a pejorative.

"I watched a car show on Netflix recently. This one was basically a race between 3 built up garage cars vs. an expensive quasi-supercar. One guy who had a crazy hot rod. I was really surprised as they showed his truck, then him getting out into his wheelchair. I loved it! 

Even better was when he beat the douche in the Ford supercar. "

I did point out to the journalist that i have been wanting these plates since last year, only wasn't able to afford them until now seeing as i'm paying off the Tesla as well. The stars just happened to align. The plates were ordered before the initial article was discussed.

As a disabled guy; a lot of people assume (and kinda actually want) disabled people to be poor.
Good for you! I don't understand how people can be so judgemental. Maybe jelousy over your amazing car? Keep on not giving a fuck what other people think!
"Yeah fuck 'em.  Drive what YOU want to drive.  If you figure out how to fit a wheelchair in the passenger seat of a Miata, all the more power to you!

Though to be fair, the Model X *is* a minivan. It has 3rd row seating and rear doors that open bigger than normal. Definitely a fancy minivan ;)"
Guy near me has a lifted 4*4 with wheel chair lift to the driver side.  People equate handicapped with poor and destitute. Not minivan.  
"I’m missing an arm  - have a handicap park badge- and wrapped my model x in a matte/satin black , carbon fiber black out and vanity plates.  Let em stare. "

Kidding. Keep at it! Show them who's boss, don't let the stereotypical image the walkies have of us keep you down. Not driving a minivan should be a stamp of pride! If you're ever in Norway you can borrow the S as much as you want, plates included!"
"Well you CAN get the extra seats to make it seem like a minivan, but yeah enjoy the cars you like, don't let others pull you down."
Tbf the Model X is *almost* a minivan.
"Sometimes I judge people but not really to hard, just a oh my gosh to myself but your comment has made me change my mind. "

Because their stupid logic tells them that handicapped people can't have a tesla
Dan Neil was [bullied right the hell off of Twitter](https://tiremeetsroad.com/2018/07/21/here-are-the-tweets-that-drove-dan-neil-to-delete-his-twitter-account/) after he wrote positive impressions of the Tesla Performance Model 3.
"I can indeed. Butt first, pull feet in. Seatbelt on, swing left and ""hang out"" of the car. Take both wheels of and put them behind the passenger seat, then lift the core of the chair between yourself and the steering wheel and let it sit in the passenger seat. Put the cushion from the chair under it to keep your seat looking nice."
You open the door and get in? There are actually complete loading systems for the chair. And you can put a small board between the wheelchair and the drivers seat to scoot over. 
It's extra funny when i park [the BMW](https://i.imgur.com/VqvrGLU.png) in handicap spots. I should put the plate on that instead...
"Alas, we can keep saying that yet people will keep believing it as it is a way for them to feel superior to others"
"Don't you know? They're all supposed to have 1985 Ford Econoline camper conversions, or Chrysler Town & Country vans with the wheelchair lift thru the back hatch. I mean, how will all the rest of us know otherwise? /s"
I mean we use Reddit we’re all pretty handicapped
"Hell yeah, i drive it! Or it mostly drives itself."
"I know a carpenter that is handicapped. Lost his leg in a construction accident but still works and drives a work van full of tools.  Parked in a handicap spot and someone called the cops on him. When they showed that the helper  to send out the owner of the van. He wouldn't come out made them come in for obvious reasons. Then just pulled his pants leg up and tapped on the fake leg. Gave them a nice story to tell. 

"
In Norway it ain’t socially accepted to “show off” if you have money.
"It's a Model S, P85+ with AP. X is too tall for me to get into."
fuck off
"Besides, have you thought about what those customized vans must cost?  Sheesh, wouldn’t be surprised if a Tesla was cheaper. "
Well and not all people in wheelchairs are paralyzed and can’t use their legs. 
"There was a super nice older couple in my community that drove supercars with hand controls. She drove an orange Gallardo, then upgraded to a yellow Gallardo Spyder. He drove an R8 V8, then upgraded to a red V10. They would sometimes roll up to the local mall and if some kids (ie me and my friends) were hanging around and wanted to oogle their cars, they would always stop and chat with us for a minute or two. Last I heard, they both drove McLarens. Insurance really pays out sometimes, I guess."
"I passed a place in Texas that sold lifted trucks for wheelchairs, the door pushes out, and lowers like an elevator"
"Well, yeah. People very unfortunately often equate handicapped == loser. This thereby excludes anyone who drives a car that they perceive as nice or expensive, because people *also* often very unfortunately equate rich == impressive.

Instead of discarding their preconceptions, to reduce cognitive dissonance, they will conclude that a handicapped person driving a nice car isn't actually handicapped, instead of the more reasonable conclusion that handicapped people can drive nice cars."
"I have a patient that has paraplegia, and he rides a motorcycle. He calls it his “Roman Chariot”, but it is his daily driver. He’s gone from Louisiana to Alaska as his furthest ride and enjoys people asking about it and showing them that just because “everything in the trunk is busted doesn’t mean life has to be too”. He’s definitely a character, and I’m always happy when he’s in for his visits! We’ve been trying to find a DOT approved helmet that looks like a Roman helmet for him so he can cruise in style.

Edit... no a Trojan condom on his head is not an acceptable DOT approved helmet. Thanks for the very creepy messages though..... only on Reddit..."

[Here's](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkVV2Fzl9lI/?taken-by=jason_watt_dk) a video of him gunning it at Le Mans, while his wheelchair is attached to the roof. Guy is super awesome."
"An old boss of mine was paralyzed from the waist down after an accident a few years prior. Dude had all the confidence in the world, had a corvette that he whipped around, when we were at a bar women sat in his lap. Totally broke any stereotypes from them on. "
There's a guy in a wheelchair who has a hand controlled Chevy Blazer that he drag races. It's called Open Container and 1320video did a video on it.
"Buddy of mine was completely paralyzed from waist down, drove a badass M5 BMW, which really passed me off because it had a modified drivers seat and hand controls, so I couldn’t drive it. I think it was really selfish to buy something that only he can use. Oh, and for all of you bores out there, this is obviously /s"
"For some reason where I live in Florida, Maseratis are quite common in the handicapped spots. "
"I used to RallyCross with 2 guys in wheelchairs who fitted an old Nissan with a hand drive system (and other rally things). They weren't the fastest, but they definitely had the biggest smiles and were super cool with people wanting to sit in the car to check it out. They loved showing off how they built everything and how it worked."

"> Frequently 

Ok, this is a giant overstatement.  Does it happen occasionally?  Sure.  If you drive past handicapped spaces in most parking lots, they’re typically empty.  This is an infrequent problem at most."
"> true disability

What is a ""true disability""? If senior citizens or obese people have trouble getting around then they are disabled, especially if their doctor has signed off on a disabled plate. You sound a little biased against obese people and senior citizens. Look up the word disabled in the dictionary maybe you'll get a clue. "
"If people are disabled and can’t move much, do you think that might have an impact on their weight? "
"> the obese

If you have (say) a degenerative spine condition it becomes difficult or impossible to exercise. Also, a lot of medications increase appetite (e.g. steroids). So now you can't walk and are constantly ravenously hungry. You also have nothing to do all day but try to find ways to distract yourself from the pain. Most people will end up gaining weight. Some of them quite a bit. 

When you see a fat person taking a disabled space, it's not always accurate to assume they have a placard for being fat. They might have something wrong that makes them mobility limited, and the obesity is a side effect."
"The question is disabled because obese, or obese because disabled?  I have an injury that makes it so painful to walk I feel like screaming sometimes.  I go back and forth on weight because I have to work 10 times harder to lose it now (want to scream in pain from walking? sure lets run 3 miles a day!) but if I gave in and took the placard I qualify for I'd end up one of those obese scooter people you wonder why they're in handicap.  Fuck that, I'll go park my Tesla in the back of the lot where all the expensive cars do and walk three times further than your perfectly capable ass parking in the handicap illegally."
I saw a motorcycle parked in the handicap spot once. Sure enough they issue handicap motorcycle plates!
"my wife has stage 4 cancer and it has trashed a spinal disk. She can't walk because of the huge pain it causes her, and needs a wheelchair. So we have to do this dance of getting the wheel chair out of the back of the car, opening her door, moving it into place, and me standing over her so she can use my neck and arms to lift herself out of the car and into the wheelchair. Then move the wheelchair back, and shut and lock the door. So it requires some space on the passenger door side of the car to do this. I can't tell you the number of times people who can walk have abused the disabled parking privilege, and made us have to look for a parking place that has space on the side of it. Then I have to wheel her across the parking lot. Sometimes it is impossible for me to find a spot, so I have to park behind the disabled spots to unload her and wheel her into a store. It really pisses me off when, in the middle of unloading her, some idiot who was parked in the disabled spot, some idiot who does not have an ambulatory problem, asks me why I parked there, to hurry up so they and there snot nose kids can leave. Not once this has happened - three times this year alone. One well off couple, one family of seven, and one guy who borrowed a tag. None of them looked like they needed a disabled tag. I blew up at the well off couple because they said they were in a hurry. Didn't offer to help, hold a store door open, nothing. I told them ""I am sorry my wife's condition is inconveniencing you. And I think it went right over their heads."
"Obese people really grind my gears, literally dragging the country down"
Did you just fat shame? /s
"Here is the list of reasons that you can get a placard in MA https://www.mass.gov/service-details/disability-plates-and-placards.  Not listed:

* Being fat
* Being old
* Being an ignorant fuck (so unfortunately you aren't eligible)

Maybe your state is different though :)"
That guy is awesome. 
I mean if you had mobility issues a fast powerful car would be even more  attractive right.
"If he's not completely paralyzed, it's a pretty easy matter to move his hands and feet the small amount required to operate a vehicle.  This was the impetus behind the invention of vehicles; make it so people don't *need* to walk.

There are countless types of disability/handicap, some make it impossible to drive, but many don't impact the activity at all."
"Terminology changes all the time, give it a rest. And anyway, the picture on the post has a disabled person with a license plate that says ""crippled"" and the top level comment directly below this one has a girl who refers to herself as ""handicapped"". The person in the pic is using a pejorative word jokingly and handicapped is clearly still in use as a non-offensive term. I've honestly not even heard of handicapped being ""pejorative"" anyway given that it means exactly the same thing as disabled, but in the interest of not insulting people I'm always willing to listen to people who aren't assholes. Unfortunately, you seem to be an asshole, and one who doesn't even seem to have consensus on their side to boot.

"> They cost $1100 and don't work in many European countries. 

Not true. They are perfectly legal in the EU, just not yet recognized by every nations computer systems. I haven't heard of a single case where someone was told they weren't usable in any country they've traveled to and these have been going around for a long while."
Just like oil revenue!
"> don't work in many European countries. 

What? How is that even possible? Shouldn't other countries have no control over your vehicles registration?

I know I have custom plates here in the US and I have driven through most of Central America and back with no issues."
"I bet it will cost more than they bring in unfortunately. The management and productions costs a little bit, but the customization of [ANPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_number-plate_recognition) systems (including our automatic toll road system, police car readers and stuff like that) will cost a lot."
$1100 is like pocket change in Norway
Is it because seeing someone less abled than them be more successful makes them feel inferior? Kind of a big claim but it's the first thing I thought of.
"In Norway there's also an underlying problem fueled by the system in which disabled people only get financial help to purchase vans, even though a station wagon or smaller car will suit them and their needs way better..."
The thing is some disabled people (dont wanna assume or anything) are disabled cos of an accident and they probably sued and maybe won the case so they get compensated and They get money. Doesnt always happen but thats how it works. You get injured and its not your fault You Sue

Looks like some wheelchair accessible vans go for $30k-$40k new.
"The tesla is cheaper. One of my in-laws makes custom handicap vehicles. 100K plus for a motorcycle, they made one for a guy with no legs below the knee and only one hand. I wish I had a picture, the MC actually had a stand that came out at stops to balance the bike, among many other customizations. 

100K+ for a RV for a guy with 1 finger per hand and only one leg, etc. Every vehicle they have made was over 100K easily. Custom robotics, switches, seating, etc all made specifically for one person isn't cheap.
"
"There's also people who can walk without a wheelchair that need handicapped parking for other reasons.

As well as people who aren't visibly disabled that could need handicapped parking."
"Some are blind and can't use their eyes.

So hopefully soon Tesla's will fully drive for them."
"this is me right now, waiting for a left hip replacement so i cant walk all that great without being doped up on opiates so my doc gave me a recommendation for a handicapped parking placard.  i dont use it all that often because alot of the time i dont need it, but when i do and get out of a low sporty car people sure do look with disgust on their faces "
"Reminds of this super nice dude that lived near my dad.  He was a retired lawyer, he had a Dodge viper and a Diablo.  Whenever he would take one of them out he'd swing by the plaza that we hung around at after school, and if anyone was interested in looking at his cars he'd pop the hood, or let you sit in it, take a bunch of pictures, etc.  Just an all around swell guy."

"You gotta have some sort of handicap to want a Maserati. Well, to own one and actually have it between repairs. "
"I’m a disabled vet and I have a handicap that can be intermittent. Some days I can get around just fine and others I can barely stand, and it can hit me without notice. I get the “you don’t look disabled” all the time even though I’m considered housebound by the VA. So there are people out there with non visible disabilities that people should not assume they are just trying to get a close spot. 

Now me personally, I don’t have a handicap pass because I have the military mindset of “just deal with it and suck it up” and I also think there are many people out their that need the spot far more than me. Now for the people making up stuff to get a close spot or using someone else’s pass, that just pisses me off like no other. If you give your pass to someone else to use and are caught, you should be fined and lose that pass for a year on the first offense, permanently on the second. 

"
You really shouldn’t judge anyone who has a valid handicap placard just because they don’t fit your image of handicapped.

A friend I had would always get hassled because he looked healthy and acted that way when parking with his placard. Unfortunately he passed away a year or so after I met him.

Valid. Occasionally is more accurate. 
"Completely depends on where you live. You're less likely to notice the times when they're full if you're not someone that needs the spots. I have two options when going to a store - a handicap spot with a hashed area that guarantees I can get my chair in and out of my car, or parking way in the back and hoping no one parks next to me. "
"Depends! When I work out I can watch out the window to the parking lot, and there are only two handicap spots in the gym/strip mall area close by.. theyre usually taken by old ppl (I live in a retirement area basically) or indeed fat people. Once a lady parked in the spot, hopped out, and walked over and entered the gym to work out.. lol..(with a valid placard)"
"Obesity doesn’t naturally occur in the vast majority of people, even with an absence of exercise. It’s usually the by product of a lack of portion control or poor dietary choices, that are exacerbated by the sedentary lifestyle (whether this is intentional or not by the person). Limiting calorie intake and eating healthier foods can absolutely prevent obesity in most people, bar gland issues or a variety of other quite rare cases.
Obesity isn’t natural, we’ve just hypernormalized it. "

If they're claiming handicap because of being obese, which helps make them more obese, then fuck them.

">Unfortunately, you seem to be an asshole, and one who doesn't even seem to have consensus on their side to boot.

I'm not an asshole for calling someone out for mocking other people.  And if you are willing to argue with the dictionary then you are 100% the asshole.

Your definition of asshole is ""People who agree with you"".  I know you and the dictionary aren't on great terms but the term to describe a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to their own opinions is ""bigot"""

"They don't control other countries' vehicles registration, but which cars can drive on their own roads, and what type of license plate they need to have."
"Why?  Such an ANPR system doesn't get developed just for a single small country.  They are going to have customers elsewhere with other license plate designs.  Probably most of those places have vanity plates already.  I know Denmark does -- we've had them for close to three decades.

Different plate shapes, different colours, different fonts, and whether there is a blue strip with a country code and a flag probably all matter more."
No.
"Probably, yes."
"Just because you have a physical disability doesn't mean you're mentally handicapped.  The woman who used to babysit my kids, her husband had a spine issue and couldn't walk.  He was a CPA.  He could drive, I'm sure he could figure out a Tesla if he wanted.  He did have the classic van though lol."
"Eny is to desire or have something someone has.

And jealousy is just showing envy for someone else possessions or achievements. 

They'er pretty interchangeable, except generally being in envy of someone isn't looked down upon as much as being jealous.

">So hopefully soon Tesla's will fully drive for them.

"Side note, and you may already know this, but don't drink alcohol while on opiates.  The combination can deaden the part of the brain that controls your unconscious breathing.  I had a 32 year old cousin who was in pain and on opiates for the pain.  She had been drinking to help dead it, thinking that the alcohol would amplify the opiates effect.  She then went to take a short nap.  Her husband went in at dinner time to wake her and she was dead and her body was cold.  He was later told about the combination of alcohol and opiates being deadly, and that she had just stopped breathing while asleep.  He, and she, had never been told about this possibility before.

He remained super active, and if he's not wearing shorts you can't really tell that he's on a prosthesis. He does sometimes park up in disabled bays though, because he can. I've been with him when someone has called him out on ""not looking disabled"" and his go-to response is to pull off his prosthesis, throw it at the person and scream ""HOW ABOUT NOW? CAN I PARK HERE NOW?!"" Not because he's particularly angry or indignant, he just thinks he's funny."
"So that explains why you spend so much time on reddit. Seems like you and I are in similar situations. Non obvious disabilities are frustrating. Today I'm fine, tomorrow though ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.

Well at least the world gets your amazing analysis of space and technology stuff. :)"
Isn’t the purpose of the space’s proximity to the business solely for the purpose of the driver or passenger being physically handicapped? I know people who are mentally handicapped and they don’t have one. The only time I ever had one was when I was in a wheelchair. 
"Did someone say they have a valid handicap placard?

I think the Mercedes is probably key. There's just an expectation that someone driving a newish Mercedes is probably going to be an entitled, selfish jerk, so it comes as a surprise when they're not.

"> Obesity isn’t natural, we’ve just hypernormalized it.

My point isn't that normalization of obesity is OK, it's that just because you see someone obese with a disability placard doesn't automatically mean they got the placard *for being obese*. The fact that a badly disabled person doesn't starve to death in the forest but rather ends up in a vicious cycle of overeating and weight **gain** is a testament to just how far civilization has brought us, and how we as hairless monkeys are so ill equipped to deal with it."
"All those nice choices can be absent when you’re marginally housed, have no income (because SSA takes years to find that yes, you are disabled), and can’t even get a proper diagnosis.

Thanks for the info! 
Thanks for the response!
Nope.  Youre just such a bigot that you demand to live in an echo chamber of your own ideas and any suggestion of the presense or validity of other ideas is angering to you.
"You can very absolutely regulate who can enter your country, with which goods, with which vehicles, and with which papers. That's customs for example. You can even require that you can't drive certain vehicles on your country. Or bring in Kinder Surprise.

I don't know much about Norwegian license plate laws, but France, for example, wouldn't say that Norwegian cars on Norwegian roads can't have certain plates, but that they can't have them in France. Or a country can prohibit dangerous dogs, or meat, or meat without inspection, or meat without some license, to be brought in. 

You seem to have interesting ideas about laws and countries. I have no idea whether other countries actually have issues with Norwegian Vanity Plates, but I don't understand why they wouldn't have the right to have standards. Countries may agree on accepting the other country's plates, or they may simply don't care, but it's absurd to think they wouldn't have the right, absent any binding international treaty on the contrary. Maybe there is some EU regulation, dunno, but Norway isn't in the EU, but forms another union with Scandinavian countries (some of whom belong to the EU)."
It's still $1100 though. $1100 is $1100 no matter how many years you spread it over.

"You can get a card as a passenger, too. Old couple I know has one for the wife who won't drive; he only uses it alone when parking to pick her up."
"It's not really an issue if the triggers for them are basically deterministic and easily avoided (say, if they enter a particular posture that is nothing like that used for driving). It *is* an issue if they're random, or the triggers are very difficult to avoid (e.g. epilepsy).

Predictable, easily avoided seizures are much less dangerous than elderly drivers. Mostly because they *know* they can be dangerous and drive accordingly, but naturally also all of the other risks with the elderly."
You can get a placard (at least in my state) even if you don't own a vehicle or aren't a licensed driver.  This allows a car which you are a passenger in to park close to the entrance of where you are going.

Other than being elderly, she looked able to walk normally but because her leg muscle couldnt get good circulation she could only walk a short amount before needing to sit down to recover. 

A few years later with chemo, just being steady on her feet and walking was hard. Depending on timing, it wasnt always obvious she was on chemo.

I dealt with wheelchair bound people working for a wheelchair design company. I know people with disabilities have major access battles and I already knew from my brief involvement with ems, elderly people can have really shitty experiences. Helping my mom, who was hyperself-reliant, every week and seeing how many things became way more difficult so quickly really opened my eyes so simple struggles we take for granted."
Those who cant walk as far or have issues with holding bags of groceries are the first two that come to mind
"Weather is not the driving factor on being close. Some people struggle to move themselves in a wheelchair, or tire easily. Wheelchair use is really hard on your upper body joints."
"I had a friend in college who’s lupus made it so he got really sunburned after minutes of direct sunlight, so a handicap spot + and umbrella were basically a necessity for him to go out to the store unless it was really cloudy out.

His issue was definitely unique though"
That is very true. Could be a pick up. 
"This is true.  I know someone with brain damage that loses consciousness without warning, she's visibly normal unless you see an episode but her husband has a valid hc tag because she's in less danger if she spends less time in traffic / parking lots.  "
"Like what?

I’m not trying to argue with you either. This is just how I try to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. I can’t think of a physical handicap off the top of my head that can’t been seen when they are walking. 

Edit: Thanks guys. Now I know. "
"My family did this when I was younger. Grandma had a handicap card and my parents would take it and use it when we went places. Even though I was really young, it never felt right and I felt pretty guilty getting out of the car and being perfectly capable. I knew we were taking a spot from somebody who actually needed it and it made me feel really bad. Although, whether it's guilt or otherwise, I now feel like I have a lot of respect for handicapped people. I try my best to be as considerate as possible."
">	That's not abusing the system, that's simply illegal.

This is a false dichotomy. The better the law gets, the less likely it is that someone could abuse the system it creates without breaking the law. "
"I'm not arguing that it is or isn't illegal, and I'm not trying to argue semantics, use whatever word you want. People do this very commonly."
"Serious question: what if the spouse is picking up the disabled person? Wouldn’t it make sense to park close, so that they can easily get into the car? Would this usage still be illegal?"
I agree people shouldn't judge. My dad had a lung transplant. He could walk just fine but was distance limited. 
"> There are so many different handicaps that ""having a hard time walking"" isn't a catch-all.

Back when I was recovering from a major leg injury and could hardly walk, I was on a forum for people with physical disabilities and this was actually a pretty regular topic of discussion. Months of back and forth pretty much solidified the argument with regard to disability parking down to this:

>Disability parking is intended for those with mobility issues that make parking farther away or with no side room unworkable. With the exception of people with a missing arm or hand(s), there is no person with a mobility issue who will ever *run* into the store. Short of seeing someone do that, you cannot judge... and even then you must make sure they're not just the *driver* for a disabled person and are picking them up, because that's also allowed.

That said, there are clearly plenty of people who have placards as little more than a privilege of being older and having a doctor willing to sign off on it. You just can't say anything because *you never know which ones they are*. "
"That's not accurate at all, plenty of people borrow said placard just to park there. "
"My parents have a handicap sign, they can walk just fine. Just lazy and entitled. I’m sure many other people are that way. I refuse to park in a handicap spot when I’m with them. I’m sure this is not a one off thing."
"Also, you can get license plates with it on it. I think my dad's says ""Partially Disabled Veteran"" or something like that"
"Lol, so your entire argument is based off of your own personal speculation?

No, vehicle registration is not the same as goods passing through customs. That's a completely separate and unrelated topic, is hilarious you are trying to make them seem like the same thing. You obviously have not driven over many national borders. 

It would be asinine if they would tell you you cannot enter the country with vanity plates. All border agents care about is the vehicle being properly insured and registered per the requirements of the country of origin. You don't have to register your car every time you cross a boarder."
"Not really, paying $1100 once is a lot more of a burden on your wallet if you make like $5000 a month, compared to paying $110 10 times "

I stared at it for 2 minutes and forgot you were handicapped. 
Yoooooo that pooper scooper. Necessity is the mother of fucking invention bro. Keep fighting the good fight.
Woah man you have an amazing life. I will read your book. Sorry about your accident whatever happened
Cute doggy... sweet ride...
"Sure. I can see that. If you can feel it coming or you can avoid it, I can go with that."
"YEs, some canadian provinces issue rearview mirror hangers - but it is an offense to use them without the person it's issued being involved. MY father in law used it for transporting his wife's mother who could barely walk. "
Fair enough. I can accept that.
"Polio.

My dad is more or less bound to a wheelchair now, but back when he wasn't he was just walking a tad slower than most people.  
..and after 100 meters he had to sit down and catch his breath, because the illness caused his spine/chest to partially collapse and push on his lungs so he had ~30% lung capacity.

Also: Vaccinate your damn kids, people."
Heart problem which makes you unable to walk far. The guy above who had stomach surgery. A bad knee that can’t take a lot of walking. Lots of stuff. 
"I have multiple sclerosis. If I’m walking slow (not cartoonishly slow, just normal slower pace) you probably can’t tell. I can’t do heat at all, heat causes me to lose the ability to push off with my right foot and seriously affects my balance. So on hot summer days I park in the handicapped spots so that I can get into the AC as quick as possible. Have been on the receiving end of some dirty looks but I just think of it as people using the power of shame trying to protect those spots, so I’m ok with it.  "
Chronic pain (central sensitisation / hyperalgesia)... *raises hand*
"I wasn't arguing semantics; I was saying that it's more than just cheating the system.

At least, the way I see it.  Cheating the system would be, like, if it were technically legal, but obviously not the intended use.

... OK, now I'm arguing semantics. "
"My mother (who does have trouble walking and really does need a handicap spot) will give friends & family her handicap sign if they are going somewhere.  I feel super sketch when she gives it to me, I don't actually use it.  But I sure do see lots of people who appear to not be handicapped use the handicapped parking spots, and it tends to be people in nicer cars.  

Some people use their dead relative's handicapped sign. 
 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/parking-permit-fraud-toronto-1.4375813
 
"
"Then report them. If their lying about that then they could be lying to get other resources that are for handicapped individuals and thats fraud. 

My wife is disabled and a lot of times she can't use handicapped spots or take up resources because ""frauds"" and assholes will take the spots leaving her to have to pretty much limp across the parking lot. Plus several places will automatically give you resources specifically meant for disabled persons simply because you have a sign. This takes up the little resources truly disabled people have. 

If they truly need it then it'll be worked out. But if it's really fraud like you say then theres no excuse and they need to be turned in so the sign can be taken. "
That's not the only reason to disallow though. Plates are also used for tracking and infringements.
A friend of mine has scar tissue on his brain and is prone to a seizure or 2 a day. He can always tell when one is a out to happen about 5 minute before.  His foresight let's him use it as a party trick to scare the shit out of people. It's even gotten him a few pity fucks.
">MY father in law used it for transporting his wife's mother who could barely walk.

It took me more than a second to figure out this is just your father-in-law's mother-in-law."
">	But I sure do see lots of people who appear to not be handicapped use the handicapped parking spots, and it tends to be people in nicer cars.

I want to emphasize that just because they appear to not be handicapped, it doesn’t mean that they aren’t. The fact that they drive a nice car may feed into this bias. This can be dangerous thinking. 

If they have a placard, then a doctor was willing to approve the paperwork for it. I’m not more qualified than a doctor to argue. 

Some people may use their relatives’ placards, but we should discourage this behavior if we see it. Even though I’d never use my wife’s placard without her in the car, I know my wife would not approve of me doing so. I’m glad to hear you don’t feel comfortable using your mother’s placard.

Even then, I’d rather give these people the benefit of the doubt. Report them to the police if needed, but don’t harass them. "
"Yup, my parents always try to give me theirs when I go to Disney since the parking is so far. I don’t use it."
Careful assuming. One time my daughter was berated by do-gooders when she returned from a store to her boyfriend’s car to get his wallet. She’s perfectly able-bodied. He’s paralyzed from the waist down and in a wheelchair.
"> Plates are also used for tracking and infringements.

Well yeah, of course. But it's not like vanity plates are used any different than normal plates. "
"Please do this. I am currently recovering from a pretty major abdominal surgery; I look healthy enough, and can walk okay, but can only walk a few hundred feet before I’m pretty much wiped. There are certain places where if I parked in a non-handicapped spot right now, I’d have to take a few breaks walking to the destination.

There are a lot of people with ‘invisible illnesses’ which can be quite severe and require disability tags (lots of autoimmune diseases can be this way).

Even here, though, I will not use the tag if I’m feeling well enough to walk the extra distance, or if I’m having a good day."
"So people who can walk but are just to lazy to walk end up taking the spots of people who can’t walk?

That’s some bad karma."
"Honestly only report if you know the person personally and the circumstances are clear. Not advocating for going after people in the wild. The reality is that plenty of people have hidden disabilities (my wife is sorta like this) that justify them for needing placards, you can't judge anyone without knowing the individual and their situation personally. But plenty of people know others who purposely go out of their way to commit fraud and the only people who can stop them are those who speak up and out against their behavior. 

I can get people who help or serve disabled folks and are just caught in the judgmental crossfires; I honestly have no issue with them. I have situations like your daughter all the time when I'm out with my wife and people don't notice or mind her disability and call me out. But those with no disability or are not serving a person with disabilities at the moment need to rightfully be told their committing fraud and held accountable, and the only people who can really report them are like the poster above. "
Yup
"The follow up is that she showed the lady the hand controls in the car, and the lady was mortified. Point is, if there’s a placard and/or a plate, be prepared to be humiliated if you feel compelled to call someone out."

I know 7,000 seems close to 5,000... but it's actually 40% more.

This is fraud. No way they actually produced 5K in a week based on the past numbers that Elon himself disclosed. Not to mention that they fudged the April numbers to get it over 2K.

"> 5000 model 3s, 2000 S and X according to electrek who has an internal email.

Here's the exact quote from Elon's email:

> **“Not only did we factory gate 5000 Model 3’s, but we also achieved the S & X production target for a combined 7000 vehicle week!”**

Amazing - I didn't expect them to push full Model 3 capacity while they are doing full S and X capacity as well!

(BTW., this means that last week's paint shop conspiracy theory which has ""proven"" that the Fremont paint shop cannot paint more than around 4,000 cars per week ... just went up in flames, just like the short position of the shorts who were spreading it.)

Also note that the 5,000 Model 3's manufactured last week is **not a sustained rate: the rate will keep rising to 6,000/week and 7,000/week**, with burst tests. Tesla has guided in the past that they believe they can reach 10,000/week with ""minimal additional capital expenditure"".

____
Update:

here's a quick analysis (well, guesses really!) for what might happen to the TSLA stock tomorrow:

- The 5,000/week target was communicated in May already, but the big rally from below $300 levels started on June 6th, right after Elon Musk's shareholder meeting on June 5th.
- The biggest news was the Chinese Gigafactory, so I think the Chinese GF is probably already priced in.
- Two short months ago in April Goldman Sachs was predicting [1,400/week Model 3 numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/goldman-sachs-cuts-tesla-price-target-predicts-model-3-disappointments-and-capital-raise.html) ...

Against that negative sentiment demonstrating 7,000/week combined output in a single week (which rate extrapolates to about 5 billion dollars or revenue per quarter and about 20 billion dollars of revenue per year) is very big news and a real confirmation of the Q3 profitability guidance, and I expect tomorrow the TSLA floodgates to open in two ways:

- **90% of the short thesis just went up in flames**, after which rational TSLA shorts have no choice but to liquidate their short positions
- **a very significant bull thesis got confirmed**, which will draw in more conservative long-term investors as well

I cannot possibly predict what the effect of these two forces *at once* is going to be ... except that I'm pretty sure that it won't be a small price move.

"Along with some Chevy Novas they threw in made with the old NUMMI machinery, just for fun."
[This article](https://electrek.co/2018/07/01/tesla-model-3-production-milestone-record-total-production-elon-musk/) says 2k S/X + 5k 3

That's what I'm assuming...
I think it has to be based on all reports.

7000 per week for S/X."
God damn would it be a delightful July 4th if we hit $400. 
I think it will be blowing past $400
"I hope so, for the sake of my calls expiring *shortly.*"
Is buying just one stock possible? 
The road to $400 is paved in shorts' shorts and tears.
Reading this three days late is proof of why I don't put any money for or against this company.
"That article mistakenly claims Tesla is producing 7,000 S/X per week."

What do you use to see that?
Or the Reddit “fuzzing” algorithm. They still do that right?
"As a comparison point:

An S or X rolls off the line every 302 seconds on average (based on 2k/wk)  
A Model 3 rolls off the line every 121 seconds on average (based on 5k/wk)

An F150 rolls off the line every 53 seconds (based on Ford's tweets recently) which means they make about 11,411 of them per week.  And that's just their top selling vehicle."
"Ford sold ~6.6 million vehicles last year, which comes out to ~127k per week.

I follow a bunch of shorts on Twitter so let me tell you, ""Tesla will not meet their doubly-delayed production target"" is not the basis of the short thesis.

In fact, I think that if you made a survey among the shorts one year ago, most would say that Tesla will achieve 5k *before* today."
"> except that I'm pretty sure that it won't be a small price move.

I don't think it will be huge.  Most people who buy in to Tesla already believed they would hit the 5k weekly mark soon, so this isn't positive news above and beyond what was expected to happen.  For people shorting Tesla, I doubt many did so on the belief that they'd never be able to hit a 5k weekly rate.  It's probably more about not thinking they can do so profitably.  Q3 and Q4 numbers will be the thing needed to prove them wrong.  Though either way, this is confirmation that Tesla is doing something right, so that's reason for at least some bump in stock price.

Of course I'm just a shmuck who has never bought an individual stock in his life, so I could certainly be way off base here."

Worth remembering that even at very low rates, the q1 average was lower than q4 burst, which will be informing the goldman model "

That is where Tesla wants to get to with Model 3.

What I don't know is, how long it took Ford to ramp to that level of production...

Most probably Ford had a factory that was already making a similar model.

Most likely the engine is made in a different factory and again is a minor variation on engines Ford previously made.

I'm not criticising Ford, but the challenge for Tesla is substantially bigger.....

So it might take Tesla a bit longer to get to that 10k per week level.... the main thing is they get there..."
"Sweet, :) as soon as Tesla starts making trucks they can up their throughput."

Which they are. They own the entire vertical. If the expand beyond infrastructure to services, they will become the next definitive big tech company."
"> I predict the stock does nothing noteworthy and ultimately sells off with earnings.

If you are a TSLA short then I encourage you to hold on tight to your short position based on that theory, until the margin call: this altruistic act of selling low and buying high will give Tesla the biggest overall benefit, where Tesla shorts will partially pay for all the damage they have caused.

"You are correct




""Buy the rumor, sell the news"" The movement already occured but then again, this obviously doesn't always apply "
"> ""Tesla will not meet their doubly-delayed production target"" is not the basis of the short thesis.

So here I'm more referring to the more credible bear/short Wall Street analysts making rational arguments, like Goldman Sachs who two short months ago predicted [1,400/week Model 3 numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/goldman-sachs-cuts-tesla-price-target-predicts-model-3-disappointments-and-capital-raise.html) ...

The shorts and conspiracy theorists on Twitter have no coherent, rational arguments, so it's hard to ""prove"" that cesspool of opinion wrong - the best we can do is to pick out the ones that are presented as rational arguments, and disprove them one by one.

Such as [last week's paint shop conspiracy theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8v5hj4/anyone_able_to_fact_check_refute_confirm_this/?sort=confidence)."
">  For people shorting Tesla, I doubt many did so on the belief that they'd never be able to hit a 5k weekly rate. 

[Here's Goldman Sachs predicting 1,400/week Model 3 numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/goldman-sachs-cuts-tesla-price-target-predicts-model-3-disappointments-and-capital-raise.html).

Investors giving any credence to Goldman Sachs investment advice will certainly update their portfolios - (including Goldman Sachs themselves, I hope).
"
Not positive news? What? 
"It went from $280 to $350 recently, likely baking in the fact of production getting better.

I'm not sure investors are valuing it at $350 and poor production (which would be the case if it were to sky rocket on this 5K number)"
"Meh, then people will just move the goalposts again like you did in this comment. This happens every time Tesla does something people said was impossible.

Tesla haters: that's impossible no way they can do that.

Tesla: *doing the supposedly impossible*

Tesla haters: well yea, they were able to do that, but what about this completely new impossible thing that I didn't mention before!?"
"> I don't think this alone will be the burn of the century.

Maybe, but it could be more than enough for a 'bear trap': a persistently high share price at which shorts can only close their positions at significant losses - while further driving up the share price.

But we'll see it tomorrow - I'm very curious."
"Credit rating likely won’t be changed until there is a clearer indication of quality and margin.  5,000 cars a week does nothing for Tesla’s credit rating.  If margins are low and cars are coming back for repairs than building more cars could hurt their credit worthiness."
"> Genuine question, what do you expect q2 model 3 production was? I'm expecting somewhere in the 30-35k range. 

I have no idea, but it could easily be disappointing, because they were clearly holding back production both due to the upgrades for the ramp-up and due to the 200K limit.

Nor does it matter much IMO, now that they've demonstrated 1 week of production of 7,000 cars. They'll now be able to ramp up their supply chain as well and turn it into a sustained rate and beyond.
"
"5k was not expected, even by bulls. Optimistic analysts expected between 4200 and 4500, but not actually make it to 5k. The 7k is definitely an added bonus as some were expecting Tesla to focus mostly on model 3. Especially with the shared paint shop being the last bottleneck, I think it was sort of expected that they would only/mostly use it for model 3's."
Worse?
"> The company's outlook is looking worse compared to when they were at the all-time high.

I find a lot of the bull/bear argument a bit repetitive....

But this point caught my attention, what is your basis for making the claim?

Tesla are now in the position of having ramped Model 3 production to the level which they think can sustain profitability...

This is something they didn't have at the last all-time-high, they may have had the promise, but delivery  ... even late delivery is so much better than a promise.

EDIT:: Sorry I see your points below..."
"> I'm certain  

Hah, okay..."
"> I'm certain a lot of these came out of repair, or were offlined waiting for final assembly/QC.

LOL, there's very little extra space inside the Fremont factory: it is hosting around ~1,000 robots and machines and space is at a premium.

The Fremont factory is also one of the most monitored factory buildings in the world.

Where do you suppose did Tesla manage to store hundreds or thousands of partially assembled Model 3's, which takes up a *lot* of space, and moved them back into the factory, without it being noticed by anyone?

How do you explain that observers only noted trucks full of Model 3's *leaving* the factory building?"

Buy and hold stock..
"its not the logic & numbers people are investing in.... Its the dream. There is so much ""shit"" that the media focuses on nowadays. people who are making 70k+, they just want to invest in something that makes them happy when they go to sleep.


Elon, Tesla, (spaceX) etc.... they are not selling just cars, they are selling the idea of a future where we don't have to worry about climate change, Puerto Rico going out , and not being self sustaining, relying on a Gov that never came. yadda yadda yadda, this is why i think, a big part of its selling @ 20 times earnings.

"
Are the debts that have to be paid in the next 12 months more or less than 2.5B?
Big assumptions.  
"Per vehicle is not really a useful metric IMO, because the impact to the bottom line changes drastically with changes in volume.

Quarterly gross profit at 25% gross margin would be a little over $1.5B. Then you have to subtract operating expenses like R&D and SG&A (for Q1, this was a little over $1B) to get net profit.

For Q2, they likely won’t be at 25% gross margin yet which is why we probably aren’t seeing profitability until Q3. 

Hopefully OpEx will remain about the same, especially considering lay offs and some other things. Then, hopefully they can meet or exceed 25% gross margin. On top of that, if they can reach 10,000 Model 3s a week or anywhere near to it, we’re looking at some fantastic profit."
You people are so fucking delusional it's not even funny anymore.

"End of quarter is push time for all companies everywhere, all sector. Has been so forever. What do you expect, them to now work towards deadlines? "
"If they did in fact bring workers from other parts of the company, then they know what it takes to get 5k sustainable. And people will go back to their primary tasks, but I agree, I’m curious what the costs are going to be.  At least we know they can do 5k with some extra resources."
"Still very exciting IMO. 7K cars per week is no joke, very impressive. And Musk just mentioned they’re on track to up that to 8K next month. That’s almost half a million cars per year from one factory "

"> 30% chance TSLA will topple previous ATH and slimmer but possible chance to reach $400 Mon then behave sporadically after.

I'm going to make one prediction: if TSLA gets past $389 then I believe there's no known force in the universe stopping it from blowing past $400, from the many stop orders amassed in the $390-$400 range.

We know this because the stop orders already cascaded two weeks ago at the minor resistance lines of $350 and $360 already, to the tune of about +$6.

And that was just a few months old minor top, $389 is a one year old all time high ..."
"Shorting directly is dumb. Buying puts is what you want to do if you go short.

The reality is that the market is not in a good place right now and people are selling the news. I expect people to sell the news on Tesla. 

Keep in mind that the short thesis on Tesla is not production numbers. Whether they hit 5000/week this year or next year is irrelevant. The short thesis has always been valuation. "
"I’m massively long TSLA but I agree him that the shares may not do anything truly noteworthy on this 5000/wk news. The equally critical questions are not yet known: 1) is 5000/wk sustainable? And 2) what operating profit margin (EBIT/Sales) will it be done with? 

We may not get much color on those questions until the Q2 Earnings call in August, and confirmed on the Q3 call in November."
"did you read the article? That 1400/week is over the whole quarter. and even bloomberg predicted a low period in Q2.



Don't get me wrong, 1400/week is still lowballing, but one 5000 week doesn't move the average as much as you seem to think it does"
"Well, 1400/w is more pessimistic than what most bears think, so I wouldn't call that estimate credible/rational."
"That was their prediction for the average rate throughout the quarter.  18,200 for the quarter still seems low, of course."
"It's positive news, but it's also expected news.

What I was trying to say is that people who invest long-term in Tesla fully believed that they would hit the 5k/week production rate in the near term.  So this news was already priced in to the market for them, so to speak."
"> Tesla haters: well yea, they were able to do that, but what about this completely new impossible thing that I didn't mention before!?

The real reality check will be when the shorts will be facing margin calls, and then they'll declare another impossible thing: ""What do you meant that I should transfer more cash to my investment account if I want to keep my short position open?? Well, that's *impossible*, I'm short on cash!""

(Gives a new meaning to 'short shorts'. 😉)"
"My point is ""burn of the century"" usually happens when the company can surprise investors. Barely reaching the goal you have set out to do for a year is not going to cause the stock to shoot up. It's very much priced in. So I hope Elon has something else up his sleeve."
"They were supposed to be a 5K a week a year ago. 

Let's not act like Tesla has a history of proving doubters wrong."
"My point is since Elon said ""burn of the century,"" so there must be more for it to happen. Otherwise, Elon is wrong."
"> Credit rating likely won’t be changed until there is a clearer indication of quality and margin.

What Moody's cares about most are *financials*, i.e. quarterly reports. An upgrade will be very much in the cards after the Q3 quarterly report showing profits, i.e. in November 2018.

That is well before much of Tesla's short term debt is up for renewal."
"What matters is q3 overall production and profitability. Q2 burst rate is not a perfect indicator of q3 production, as shown by q1 being lower than q4 burst despite a burst of 2k in the last week of q1. 

The bottleneck appears to be general assembly, no? Given the stories out of Fremont, I'd be surprised if it were anything else.

What are your expectations for q3 and q4 production?"
"Among the bears I follow, there was high confidence that 5k will be announced / claimed. But to me, 7k total was a surprise, it means that 5k is more sustainable than I assumed."
"Yes. Out of my head: They had to move to 24/7, less automated production (must be great for gross margins). Had to build 1 or 2 (not sure) new assembly lines. Production ramp took at least twice as long as expected. Executive departure rate accelerated. China imposed tariffs + aluminium/steel tariffs. It seems that they're short on cash and it's quite possible that they might have problems raising it. One implication is that investment into future growth (Semi, Y) has been slowed down."
"> to the level which they think can sustain profitability...

Regarding this point, I think Elon might pull off Q3/Q4 profits, but after that most/all of the high-margin backlog will be exhausted *and* the vehicles will gradually become $7.5k more expensive. So I expect they will do a massive raise and continue to lose money. Or I could be wrong, that's just what I think is likely."
I've spent quite a bit of time in the factory. How about you?
"Like I said in another reply, I've spent nearly a year in the plant working on the Model 3 lines. I have a pretty firm grasp of what happens there, but maybe you know better? It's not my place to go into any depth on any of this, or I would elaborate. I never said they had thousands of cars laying around. You can see the off-lined bodies on the factory tour."
"That’s not true, if they just optimized for producing x and s without any investments for the future, they’d be very profitable. "
It's a weighted balance. When you're neglecting reality it becomes an issue 
"Tesla just doesn't have the capital, currently, to get it to market in a timely fashion. Semi trucks are a very different beast from passenger cars. So the expenditure to get a semi truck production going from scratch would be great. 

Their best bet is to partner with someone that already makes semis. Tesla would provide drivetrain, software, other electronics, and design. While the partner does the chassis, body work, and other traditional components. Volvo would be their best bet. "

"Yeah it used to be invite only, even with a reservation. Now the proverbial floodgates are open."
"Exactly this. Short sellers need to buy stock to close their positions, and a “Short squeeze” will occur when demand > supply, like this:

1.	Price goes up 
2.	Short sellers start closing positions while stock holders retain their positions, causing a spike in demand 
3.	Repeat"
"I think the dude was pointing out how reasonable 20 P/E is for the broader market.  It's actually a few points lower than the SP500 P/E (24.74), but admittedly, much higher than most automobile companies.

We need to blow through the all time high to trigger a real short squeeze. Institutional shorts have their positions secured against other assets so they can hold through a small spike. (If they wanted) 
"a small price move would be 5% or less up or down.

Take a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average (I was just looking for a list of biggest moves for a stock this one was near the top of the google results)

a small move is 0-5%  
a medium move is 5-9%  
a big move is 10+%  

but the thing about a ""run"" is that it won't just be one day. Do 3-6% day after day all going the same direction and a week or a month can be just as important as a single day with double digits."

"> I wouldn't call that estimate credible/rational.

The Goldman Sachs analyst covering Tesla is a member of a relatively small group of 20 Wall Street analysts following TSLA, and many bear/short investors would obviously take the opinion of an analyst confirming their beliefs seriously - *especially* if that analyst is at one end of the spectrum of opinion.

Furthermore, when trying to judge the risk of being wrong then it's a good idea to read the opinion of the ones you most disagree with - they could end up being right.

These bear/short arguments were presented as rational analysis.

Many of those arguments now went up in flames, and this would affect the following categories of investors:

- active shorts who used that analysis for their own portfolio decision - and would now be more likely to liquidate
- active longs who'd have *sold* in the near future due to that negative outlook - and would now not sell and decrease the pool of sellers
- passive shorts who were considering to short TSLA but will now *not* short it in the near future
- passive longs who were considering going long TSLA but were waiting due to credible looking bear opinion

This impacts all the main classes of investors: individuals, hedge funds, mutual funds and asset managers. They are probably not reading Twitter too often, but they are reading analyst opinion.

Not necessarily: a ""bear trap"" is enough to set up a ""slow burn"".

You left out a *lot* of positives which counter-balance these factors:

- Next year Tesla will begin selling the Model 3 to the rest of the world (the *other* 80% of the global automotive market), probably starting with high margin models
- The current significant payments for the new Model 3 manufacturing lines will be less as well, plus Tesla will be able to optimize their manufacturing like they did it with the Model S/X. (Possibly even more, due to higher level of automation.)
- Plus [starting next year lithium prices will start falling significantly](https://smallcaps.com.au/morgan-stanley-lithium-price-plunge-pilbara-minerals/) - by up to 45% by 2021.
- This combined with much higher Gigafactory output will reduce their battery pack prices *significantly* - which price improvements could be passed through to customers, partly offsetting the phasing out of the $7,500 tax incentive.
- A lot of people/families who can afford a $35k-$45k car don't have a federal tax bill of $7,500 to deduct from.

So I don't see margins coming down anytime soon in the next 2 years or so, in fact they could improve significantly - and I also see healthy demand going forward.

So I think if there's any significant short squeeze it will begin **after** TSLA reaches new all-time-highs.

That probably won't help many owners of the ~37m of existing shorts, and in particular those who get liquidated and lose much of their investment capital.

Retail investors might even go into debt if the price move is fast enough: stop orders don't have a price guarantee, and the stock can gap up on the open as well."
"> Tesla definitely will not benefit from tariffs.

While short term tariffs will hurt all the automakers, tariffs might even help Tesla in the long run: with the Chinese Gigafactory they could make themselves independent of U.S. tariffs and any retaliatory tariffs, while their U.S. Model 3 (and Model Y) production should be enough to meet U.S. demand.

"> Didn't even include all of them, out of my head there's also rising interest rates, more competition, service centers and Superchargers getting more load.

Yeah, so those remaining negatives are even weaker, in fact some of them are positives:

- Interest rates will only rise if the economy continues to do well, which is a (big) plus for Tesla
- The biggest competitors have plans to *start* introducing better EVs in the 2020-2021 time frame. Not a single major one plans to introduce new, Tesla-competitive EVs in 2019, so Tesla's market share is still expanding in vacuum in essence.
- Supercharger costs are actually accounted for in the manufacturing costs of the Model S/X/3 already, so I'm not sure how 'rising load' would be a problem.

But, more fundamentally, how can you even *pretend* to be able to make a fair assessment of the growth and profitability prospects by only listing the negatives in a one-sided fashion, without showing a complete aggregate of both positives and negatives?
"
"Only in a short term sense, other luxury car makers (with purportedly better finishes and safer autopilot implementations) are bringing EVs to market so Telsa's market share could get eaten into, possibly decreasing the value of their brand (forcing them into being a battery/drivetrain company).  Continued profits are not guaranteed. 

Successfully delivering a high-volume more affordable product like the Model3, and expanding into the commercial market with the semi and pickup seems like the only way to ensure a long term company stability and profits (which is needed to make financing and delivering new models to stay fresh and competitive feasible)"
No it's not obvious at all. Do you have a source that shows Tesla profits on each sale?

"It's hard to say who has and hasn't lost money, or how much they stand to lose. Every short can be hedged with calls. Any long can be hedged with puts.

There have been numerous times in the last 5 years where shorts have made a killing. It's not like every short today is the same short from 5 years ago. In theory they could all be rotating out very regularly."
"I don't think we are. Look at how much money Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc make outside the US. The US most likely has a surplus with many countries when you factor in services.

Trade isn't just about physical imports vs exports. The world's biggest and most profitable companies are all in the US and highly digital. We code in the US, put bullshit subsidiaries in tax havens, and then invoice foreign countries for 100s of billions."
"Tesla will never have that problem at least. ""Too much money, don't know what to do with it"" is smomething Elon will never say."
"No smart money actually thought Tesla would be bankrupt. Their brand goodwill and IP alone are worth more than their debt. It would be probably impossible for them to go bankrupt.

It was in fact possible (still is?) that they run into liquidity problems, but that is not the same as bankruptcy."

"> remaining negatives

I didn't imply these are remaining, just those that immediately came to mind.

> even weaker

Sneakily implying the previous ones were weak. I think they're quite strong.

> Interest rates will only rise if the economy continues to do well

Economy continuing doing well + rising interest rates is a worse situation than just economy doing well. My point is, the macroeconomic factors are more likely to become worse for Tesla than better.

> The biggest competitors have plans to *start* introducing better EVs in the 2020-2021 time frame.

Jaguar I-PACE, new Leaf with better range, etc. The thing is, the competition doesn't necessarily have to be better than Tesla (it will be in some ways) to hurt their demand. Oh, and their first 200k vehicles will still have the $7.5k subsidy.

> Supercharger costs are actually accounted for in the manufacturing costs

Ok, didn't know that. Source? Does this hold for service centers too? 

> by only listing the negatives in a one-sided fashion

When I'm arguing for a certain POV, I focus on the arguments supporting it, it's not an academic paper. I don't think the positives affect my point much. BTW, almost everyone does this, including you."
"Point well taken of course, that’s a well reasoned observation. The big part of this equation is the time horizon you are optimizing for. I think it’s clear Elon isn’t interested in a quick buck. He’s been very clear about this. It seems silly to me that people continue to be surprised by his long time horizon for his companies. 

If investors don’t like his strategy, just don’t buy it, he’s been very clear about it. Nothing to me is surprising about the financial performance of Tesla.

"> It's hard to say who has and hasn't lost money, or how much they stand to lose. Every short can be hedged with calls. Any long can be hedged with puts.

Firstly, from your comment I believe you do not appear to know an important aspect of the options market: CALL and PUT options are (net) hedged by market makers by taking direct short/long positions on the market, and delta risks are immediately hedged for liquid stocks like TSLA.

So when a trader buys a PUT option, it's made delta-neutral by the options market maker by selling the equivalent shares short on the spot market. (It's more complex than this due to the non-linear nature of options, but this is the gist of it.) I.e. in an indirect fashion PUT option owners have TSLA long counter-parties.

So when the NASDAQ says there's 37 million shares short, that's the **true net exposure of all short positions, including vanilla options contracts**.

Secondly, due to the delta-neutral (and other greeks) hedging of market makers, when the price moves up, and there are a lot of PUT options at lower strike prices, market making banks will start buying shares, to follow the updated risk profile of the open options contracts.

I.e. the money you spent on the PUT contract will, once the price moves up and it becomes less likely for your option to be in the money, is used to further increase the price of TSLA. I.e. the excessive use of PUT options by shorts can exhibit short squeeze characteristics as well. (Although the losses will be limited in that case.)

Secondly, there's a number of TSLA shorts who got into the habit of selling CALLs and earning the premium plus any short delta, which was a profitable trade for a long time - but is now an obviously dangerous position to be in, which can lose a lot of money - with no limit on the losses.
"
"> No smart money actually thought Tesla would be bankrupt.

Agreed, else we would've seen it below $200, or even $150.    
That said, the fact it's at $350 implies smart money believes they *will* hit 500k/yr (sustained) in the not-so-distant future, else the valuation wouldn't be this high.    
Until the growth rate slows, I'm a believer too.  (currently the growth rate is still accelerating YoY, and faster than even AMZN in their early years)"
"> No smart money actually thought Tesla would be bankrupt.  

The reason people think this is the high profile (read: loud) Tesla shorts (Spiegel, Chanos, people on Twitter) keep suggesting that Mus is perpetuating a massive fraud and is days away from insolvency once the continually changing smoking gun is revealed"
What makes you think TeslaCharts (or do you mean someone else?) is insane / crazy? It's one of my favourite Twitter accounts.
"> >  The biggest competitors have plans to start introducing better EVs in the 2020-2021 time frame.

LOL:

- Jaguar I-PACE planned maximum annual unit count: 15k?
- Nissan Leaf new battery pack: 39.5 kWh - while Tesla decided to *not* build a 40 kWh model back in 2014 already?

Sorry, there are no credible competitors for the Tesla Model 3 and Model S/X in 2019 in sight from any of the major players."
"It's amazing the amount of pain he (and his staff) have taken to deliver his vision, but that vision always implied heavy re-investement and very long timeframes.  Yet he continues to deliver.

It doesn't seem unreasonable to think another good quarter or two of Model 3 and production ramp up, that the risk of his strategy won't be so crazy anymore [but I do wonder where the balance between profits/dividends/happy stock holders and seeking more investment/building out new lines/factories will occur.]

Why are you scared of their success? What is the thing that pushes you to hate on a good cause?"
"> Could you ELI5 gap opening?

The NASDAQ is only open 6.5 hours per regular workday, which is only 19% of the hours in a week. When a trading session opens, the opening price is established via a 'pre market trading' protocol.

Statistically most of the major news that is breaking will break in the 80% when there's no regular trading active. As an effect of major surprises the stock can 'gap up' or 'gap down' depending on the positive/negative nature of the news.

Here's a quick example of a 'gap up':

- Someone is short 1,000 shares of TSLA with an average position price of $300
- With last Friday's closing price of $343 the floating loss of the position was about $43,000.
- The trader, to manage risks of the short position, has also placed a stop-loss order at $350 - which would close the position with a loss of $50,000.
- But if TSLA ""gaps up"" to $360 on market open, then the earliest available price to execute the stop order on will be $360 - and it's also quite likely that there are other stop orders who are competing for people willing to sell TSLA - so the order could easily fill only at $365.
- This means that instead of the expected $50,000 in maximum losses, the trader will see a loss of $65,000, much higher than anticipated.

With more violent price movements the gap-up losses can be even larger - and they can even result in the trader ending up being in debt, especially if the position was leveraged via a margin account.

CFDs and shorted TSLA options can result in even higher leverage - and even higher losses on a gap up.

Note that price movements very similar to gap-ups can happen intraday too, if major news breaks during trading hours: there's no guarantee that stop-loss orders will fill at the intended price levels.

One of the biggest gaps of a major financial instrument in history was was the ""SNB Bomb"" of 2015, which resulted in a 20%+ intraday move of a currency pair that was often traded with a leverage of 50x-100x, resulting in losses of 10-20 times the trading capital (!), and widespread bankruptcies of both brokerages, hedge funds, large traders and individuals.
"
"Is it though?  As a simple example, if I sell 100 shares short and buy 2 call options at the strike I shorted, and someone else sells me those 2 calls (and they are covered), those shares show up as shorted but the net position is bull for me and bull or flat for the covered call seller.  I'm assuming some of his risk/reward and he gets my premium but there isn't a net short position here.  

But nasdank would report 100 shares shorted.  So this seems to me its the ""exposure"" of short positions, but not the ""net exposure"" of short positions.

I agree that options do impact the underlying as MM try to be as delta neutral as possible, but I wouldn't call nasdaq reported shorts as ""net exposure"""
*she blinded me with science*
"Couldn't find source on I-Pace production but surely the supply is flexible to some extent.

I was talking about 2019 Leaf with 60 kWh battery.

But this doesn't matter, the point is, every competitor takes a little bite of Tesla's demand. Leaf is a worse car than Model 3 but it's significantly cheaper.

My argument isn't ""competition will wipe out Tesla""."
"> every competitor takes a little bite of Tesla's demand.

That's another fundamental misunderstanding: EVs take demand from ICE market share primarily, not from each other.
"
"Damn, *another* fundamental misunderstanding, so embarrassing.

Thr reality is, new EVs bite into demand of both. Whether it's primarily ICE cars depends on the specific situation."
I love that your office parking lot has a solar car port.
That's funny because I hide mine under the awning at work to avoid the rain
[deleted]
Sneaky.
You lucky Americans our Canadian Teslas need a key to be next to the car for summon to operate... 
"It looks like your window is open, you let water inside your car"
"Neat trick, but anyone that takes pride in keeping their car clean knows rain is NOT a free car wash."
Can you repark it from your office too? 
I would have preferred to stay dry and avoid water spots 
Poor guy spent all his money on the car and now he can't afford a $6 car wash...
The guy behind your S can’t park for their life. 
I’m just sittin’ here waiting for my Model 3 software update (with Summon).
Show off.
"More than this, something more funny was when I played a prank on a bunch of teens who were standing next to my parked car at a cinema parking lot. 

Around midnight, they were chatting about the horror movie they just saw inside, I summoned my car a few feet back and all the girls started screaming/jumping that the car was driving itself! They were stunned to see me walk to the car and get into the driver seat, and they asked me to explain how I did and what kind of car was that. 

After all being a TSLA long, you got to do small things whatever you can to see your beloved company through success. "
"How does it work? I thought if you summon, it would come to you. So how did you get it to come out like that and then go back to the parking spot?"
Did you just park it in the middle of the parking lot?
They should add a ev charging with all that solar
"I always wonder what Tesla owners have for occupations...

I want one so badly... soon... soon"
"\> **free car wash in rain**

That's not how it works :D"
"Why would you 'wash' your car in the rain, it's probably gonna end up dirtier..."
This is the future.
Oh what a time to be alive 
Man I want to buy my 3 so bad. But that 9k for the LR is just too much
The water spots though. It’ll need a good detail again with the rain. 
Is this at the Lockheed Martin facility in Tampa?
I would do this more often than I care to admit in public. 
Mad idea!!!!!
T@aaaaaaaaaaaaaaarhteaat@ættttttttttt the same 
It hurts just imagining the water spots after :/
I wish my life was like this...
"So, dumb question: how tight of a space can Tesla summon in and out of?

I'm a long way away from affording one, but I think my garage didn't fit it anyways unless it needs like next to no room to park."
Gee I like the idea of solar panels as carport 
"I would've loved to see a driver trying to park get annoyed that someone parked their car in the middle of the lane, only to watch it creep backwards into the space behind it"
I see water spots in your future.
"""look john! I remotely moved my car into the rain so its cleaned!""
-John: ""showoff...""
-John goes outside to get his car and parks in your spot
""You're a dick john."""
Everyone with jealousy issues hates you right now ;)
Why is the roof so tall?
"looks like the only person who'd be slightly unconvinced by this flagrant display of technical superiority parked like an asshole anyway, schooch back a few more feet."
I like how as afar as I know that no body has said anything about kit being parked the the middle of the parking lot. You know... where cars drive?
"I don't know why people think rain ""cleans"" their vehicles when in fact it doesn't. It actually adds more dirt and contains acid."
this is just some dumbass humble brag. rain always has dirt in it and it actually makes your car dirtier. 
If I had a Tesla I would be luring people with free parking space and then drive it back in again 
Too bad those solar shades don’t have heaters built in. Then you could just summon the car back in for a free dry. 
Lol free car wash? Poor car
Window slightly open ? :D Must have been a bit wet
It’s the simple things 
"Not sure, but ist the orange car a BMW i3?"
I thought you had gotten to your office then realized that you parked in the middle of the road. Lol I'm high
Uh... rain will leave a residue on your car.
Jelly
Bro I wanna work there just by looking at that parking lot. Where I sign up?
Your car is black. Are you crazy? Think about the water spots!
"wait, how.. i have to be standing right next to the car to do so. Not the case for the US?

I’m jealous lol
Can you move it back with out leaving the office or did you just block the parking lot?
[deleted]
im sure you have to wash your car after it rains.
What a time to be alive. 
Gonna wreck your paint doing shit like this. 
That seems foolish and kind of dangerous. What happens if a pedestrian comes along? A child running into the parking lot from the solar overhang? What would the car do?
Man posts on this sub are usually douchey but this takes the cake
Is there a maximum distance you could be away from the car to use summon?  Seems far looking at the pic!

Wait a minute.. did you control the car remotely?
"These are becoming pretty common in Southern California. My high school had a bunch, and I’m pretty sure all the local schools got the same panels over there parking lots.

When they first got installed I thought they’d hook up some car charge ports and were future proofing the lots."
Someone fix the solar panel snowy region problem economically already. Wish we had these in the north.
Yeah I wish my apartment complex did this lol
My co. too. 1MW over the car parking spots. Its 320W per panel with  2 500kw inverters. I cannot do this trick however. 1) my model S comes next month 2) Silicon Valley doesn't get rain at this time ;)
why are they so tall?
"Exactly, rain water is much dirtier than water from a car wash/home wash, the acidic properties in it cause hard to remove water spots and if I’m not mistaken can damage paint. 

Plus now it’ll dry and create water spots anyways 🤷‍♂️

Edit: a word "
"It was like something better than nothing as I wasn’t planning on a car wash today and it’s been a couple of week since last one. Btw, what do you do when it rains while driving? Do you always actively avoid rain and wipe off water everytime when your car drenched ? "
"This probably changes based on where you live. If it's a big city with lots of pollution, the rain will make your car dirty. If it's a smaller city with clean air, the rain will wash the car."
But... you don't tell people that you let your car have a shower while yourself staying at your working space?
"I’m on the 3rd floor. initially it said, I’m too far, but I had a clear line of sight and just moved to an adjacent window and it worked. I was able to push it back into the spot after a minute or so in the rain. Worked like a charm! "
You have to open your mouth wide and put the key up to your lower jaw. 
I was wondering the same. Everytime I've used summon I've had to get so close that the car nearly goes over my toes.. clearly I'm doing something wrong.
Dashboard for Tesla Android app doesn't seem to have the distance restriction
Use the app. 
Put the key fob besides a bottle of water : )
Squeaky.
"Easy, just duct tape a key somewhere hidden on the car. Then you don't need to be nearby at all!
Add in a webcam (unless you can get camera feeds from the Tesla), and you don't even need to be in visual range!
What could go wrong...

/s (obviously)"
I don't understand. Isn't the whole point of summon that you aren't that close to the car?
"Glad it’s not just me wondering what I’m doing wrong (UK Tesla owner). Sometimes summon has a hissy for if the fob isn’t near to the driver’s side of the car, let alone a dozen or more metres away. "
"User name checks out! Didn’t expect anyone to notice. Because of hot weather in NJ in the past couple of days, I had to turn off Cabin Overheat Protection and left the window slightly open. 

After I posted this and got off work at 7pm, I came to a slightly wet seats. Luckily it wasn’t too much. Sort of an anticlimax 😉"
Depends how dirty your car was before the rain.
"Yes, that’s what I did. "
Water spots are much better looking compared to bird droppings!
You bet! 
"It was for a minute! I just backed up, left it for a min while I saw no one near by and pushed back into the spot! No humans/animals were hurt in this act"
"Tbh this is the first meaningful use of summon in a long time for me since I don’t have a garage. 

"
Jealous 🤪
"In all seriousness, if/when my Tesla is ever ready, I’m going to have to play it pretty low profile at work. I don’t want to be the asshole with the fancy car, I just want the fancy car. 

I work in public ed, in low income schools, so flashiness is not generally good. "
"Did you gave those girls a ride? 
;)"
Can the car only move in a straight line by itself? Or can you summon it to the front of the building?  Either way it’s pretty cool. 
"Tsla long? 

Does that mean you work at Tesla?
Super cool!"
Summon is still in Beta. It just goes forward and backward at the moment. What you described is in the roadmap for full fledged summon. 
Proposed summon was to do that. Vut that level of functionality has never been implemented. Current summing just let's you move the car forward and backwards (some sideways motion) on command. It also does distance measurements so it will only let you back up it so far and not into a wall
"Not park, it’s technically in drive mode, the entire act of summoning back, wait and forth was a little over a minute, so I guess that’s fine. Given that its 4th of July tomorrow, the parking lot was so empty and lot open spaces behind my car. "
Usually Californians where making under 6 figs is poverty wage.  
depends where he lives. i find now that i live in a hot country rain just seems to add a lot of dirt to the car but in europe rain definitely cleans the car rather nicely. 
It’s worth the LR if you are in cold conditions and like the car to have good resale value. 
"It’s so slow... I get tired of it taking forever. 

Also they removed it opening the garage door as part of the process so I cannot even have it in driveway waiting like I used to. "
That’s exactly when it’s useful. It can summon into pretty tight spaces where it’s impossible to get in/out through the doors.
"It’s configurable, how tighter you want your Tesla to navigate. The mirrors close while in summon mode. I don’t remember the settings, but I guess around 1 to 2 feet on the sides. "
"Probably because of surrounding high elevated buildings, interstate highway etc., they would have calculated optimum safe height for harvesting as much solar energy as possible. "
"However, if it we're covered in dust/dirt before, it will undoubtedly look better after a rinse."
Looks can be deceiving!
I used the App on my iPhone 
Haha.. I’m not the boss.. not even by a long shot.. just passionate to own a Tesla.. 
"Summon is in beta which is goes forward and backward to help with tight garages, tight parking spaces and some odd unthought scenarios like this. In future summon is supposed to come pick you up and park itself after you step out of the car as part of future roadmap. "
"The car is equipped with cameras and sensors all around, it stops when an object is detected in path, summon works at less than 3mph speed, and more over it was raining and I had clear view of the parking lot. So, it was safe to operate the car almost as if I was inside. "
"I couldn’t find any documentation on this. But initially I got a message on the phone saying “You are too far from the vehicle, move closer and initiate summon” or something like that. I just moved to an adjacent window and it worked. From the 3rd floor window to the car, the straight line distance must be somewhere around 75 to 90feet. The image has been shot with 1.5 or may be 2x zoom "
"All those safety measures to not bump into people, cars, objects are in place with the use of cameras, ultrasonics, radars. If an object is detected/suddenly appears in the path then the summon is aborted with a message on screen - “summon aborted” "
"2028*

I wish every big box store would do this with their parking lots. 
"Praising the sun makes a lot of sense now, even though it's not sentient. The sun is nice."
"But but but, what if we put the solar panels UNDER the cars? That way they'll be more expensive and get less sun. And, I dunno... They'll have lights and stuff! And they'll melt snow! SOLAR FREAKING ROADWAYS!

^^/s ^^obvs"
Quite common in italy
"Nature should invent something like that. We could call them ""trees""."
"Petitioned the building manager to set up a level 2 charging port when they started the solar project, but they just said “phase 2” "
That is the summon feature 
You can only make it go straight forward or back. Handy for parking  in a tight garage for instance. 
"Well we are installing panels on roofs, so I don't see why we couldn't install these.  If anything, the snow issue I see is snow or ice sliding off them onto the cars parked below :-)

Supposedly there was an installation to start at Sheridan college in Brampton, Ontario, last year, (to be the largest in Canada) not sure where that's at."
My school has one in the midwest set up just like this :o
"The snow really isn't the issue, it's clouds and high latitude.  Light snow will slide off panels by itself, and the winter months when heavy snow is likely account for less than 1/4 of yearly production thanks to short days and low sun angles."
Biggest thing is rain needs a nucleus to form a drop. So each drop of rain that hits your car usually has a speck of dust or dirt on the inside which is why your car gets dirty after. 
"If a car’s paint can’t even handle rain, that’s the paints problem. "
But the entertainment value. So worth it. 😌
"Only the immediate rain, after a while it is clean rain."
"> hole wash

What is a hole wash?"
Lol
"Many people have cars parked outside and never in a garage or under a covering.  If rain destroyed paint, you would see it all over the place, but you do not.

My car has been outside for 10 years, the paint is fine."
I actively avoid rain by driving in Arizona. Can be done. lol 😂 
"Haha no, but I live in LA so there really isn't any rain!"
Cant speak for him but I agree with his thinking. I dont try avoid rain when driving etc and also dont wipe my car every time especially since a lot would be dried up by the time I was able to. I will say though (especially on black cars) most rains will make your car disgusting and I give it a rinse and dry almost every time I drive in the rain.
"driving it usually takes care of that mostly, sweeping away the rain water, but thats also why people complain about washing their car a day before a rainstorm

not because they wasted a few dollars washing it, but because now they have to wash it again after the rain"
I thought that the key fob has to be really near the car for it to work? My model S sometimes has a hissy fit if the fob is more than a couple of metres away. Did they change this in AP2 cars or something?
This shit works.  Saw this on reddit years ago been using it ever since. 
"Opening your mouth doesn't do anything, but it probably looks funny."
"Instructions unclear; Swallowed keys.
 

 
 
What now?"
I summoned from the other side of my house (inside) with no line of sight and it worked fine. Not sure what the restrictions are. 
Yep or point it at your head (which is also made up of a lot of water).
[Streaky?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J32L6dgbA-U)
"I don't have a Tesla (or any car that can be summoned for that matter) but my logic says that you should be close to the car to summon it. 

By the same logic I think the whole point of summon is to park/get out of tight spaces/garages easier."
what? I thought the whole point was to get it out from a tight parking spot.
Yeah its been crazy humid. The bears have overtaken suburban swimming pools. 
"If someone takes pride in keeping their car clean, it wouldn’t be dirty enough for rain to make it cleaner. "
Or how dirty the rain water is
Water isn't going to get it all off. Bird droppings and bug guts are very acidic and should be washed off ASAP to prevent damage to the paint. 
For me it's always a tonne of pollen. I'll definitely take that free wash. I'm also very curious what kind of rain you guys get because we definitely don't get any spots here in Switzerland.

"He was just saying the person behind you is bad at parking (look how far over the line the car is), not accusing you of anything."
"So?

It's still showoff.
"Yeah, well, at least I'm not too lazy to clean my car! hmph!!"
"Straight line, and only a few car lengths. But the idea in future is that it can valet park for you. "
"No, just a TSLA share holder for long term. "
"Oh, not even in the model S?

So the app has a backward and forward buttons or something?"
What good is just forward and backward? Other than the extremely rare circumstance of wanting your car to be in the rain instead of under shelter what is this good for? 
"I wouldn't say ""never been implemented"", probably just not released ( and not ready to be released). "
"Yea crazy stuff over there... I live just as, if not more comfortably with less.

">but in europe rain definitely cleans the car rather nicely

No way dude, this really is not how it works. It's not like rain in Europe is magically different. There's always gonna be stains. Even when I wash my car manually I always wipe water off.

Source: I am from Europe."
Mine still opens the garage door on 2018.24.1.
Man I hope they put that back. What’s the point without that?!
"That make sense, maybe the building next to it cast a shadow at certain hours."

Nice hopefully rain won’t mess with the vision image and whoever there will still be detected. 
A few of these in France
"Shit, even the damn high school I went to, the one where there was literally a school wide fight and half the students had class in portable trailers turned classrooms got solar panel car ports in the student parking lot. This is in the opposite of a forward thinking town to boot. "
Seriously! I live in Arizona so not only would it provide clean energy but much needed shade as well. 
"I wonder how this would effect the whole ""black top"" heat effect..."

"[](/tiajealous)

I think the only reason we haven't seen this take off in droves is because stores are in a rough spot nowadays. We haven't built an enclosed mall since 2006, and big box stores are getting suffocated hard from all the online stuff.

Basically, Swanson's Law's has already passed the point where it would make sense as a long-term financial investment, but brick 'n mortar isn't really a spot to be making *long-term financial investments*.

[](/sp)[](/youngtia-r)In another decade, provided they're still *around*, we could eventually see malls and big-box stores investing in that kind of infrastructure, though. Batteries in a decade will probably be substantially cheaper per MWh at utility-scale, so malls could install a battery+solar+wind package to both offset power costs throughout the week and incentivise a much larger market of EV drivers to shop while they charge. They could charge normal utility rates with discounts from regular shopping.

I'm actually surprised them parks aren't doing this already. They've *got* the regular income, large power requirements, and desire to add long-term investments that could heavily offset running costs.

edit: wait, [some theme parks](https://www.solarquotes.com.au/blog/solar-powered-theme-park-0433/) appear to be [planning to add solar canopies](https://www.themeparkinsider.com/discussion/thread.cfm?page=1771) on their roofs. "
Jolly cooperation 
Or is it?
"It’s crazy to think that basically all our power is basically just convoluted solar power.
Wind farms are utilising wind, which is created by the sun unevenly heating up the atmosphere.
Hydroelectric dams are taking advantage of the water cycle that the sun creates.
Tidal generators are mostly caused by the moon, but the suns gravity does still have some effect. Plus the sun pulled in the moon to begin with so there’s that.
Nuclear power relies on heave elements that were created in the heart of a massive sun (yeah sure maybe not OUR sun, but still...)
Even fossil fuels are just real old deposits of plants and shit, which were originally grown with the POWER OF THE SUN.

"So, all cars"
"It’s fine to have in the rain, it just leaves hard water spots, that over time, can cause damage or permanent water spots. All cars have this “problem”. "
"I'd say it's your problem too, when you own the car the paint is on :).

In all seriousness, the issue isn't whether or not the paint can handle the rain. It can. It's the contaminants contained within the rain that cause the car to look dirty and can also cause micro-marring on the surface that are the concern. When the water (rain, tap water, road water that splashes onto the paint, etc.) dries everything that was suspended in the water bead is left behind. That leads to water spots, bonded mineral contamination (particles that chemically bond to your clear coat), and etching (worst case scenario, usually resulting from heat and sunlight literally baking the water spot with the minerals etching down into your clear coat surface). Rain might make your car look a bit cleaner, but it's *not* your friend.

Good waxes/sealants and coatings put a protective, sacrificial coating between your paint and surface contaminants. All of the crap that would damage your paint eats away at your sealant instead. While it takes more work than just running the car through the local touchless car wash--which is ""touchless"" because it relies on higher water pressure and more aggressive chemical cleaners, some of which are pretty nasty--but the results are better in every respect.

Water spot damage might not be as noticeable as swirl marks, but it adds up over time. A good detailer can fix it with paint correction, but proper care and washing techniques will help limit the amount of correction necessary. You really, really don't want to be sacrificing clear coat to fix the problem every few months because you're washing your car improperly. That gets expensive, and there's a limit to how much clear coat you can remove. The [AMMO NYC beginner videos](https://www.ammonyc.com/beginner/) are a great resource for anyone interested in learning more about car care, though I'll admit some of his other videos can be a bit wordy at times."
"show us the magical paint cars should be using

link it below"
And it's your problem when you neglect the paint like OP over several years and slowly your resale value goes even lower than it would be for an outdated EV
"Home*

You do see it everyday just go look at some older cars in climates where there’s lots of rain or snow year round. 
"Yea, but when it does rain, it rains hard."
"> I give it a rinse and dry almost every time I drive in the rain

You're lucky you don't live in Belgium, you'd be broke in a year paying for car wash every day or two."
Note sure but I believe there's a difference between the US and Europe (rest of the world?) in how near to the car you need to be for summon to work.
Jeremy Clarkson taught it to me in Topeka Gear!
I’ve been doing this for 10 years. This tip came out about the same time that most cars switched to fobs. My estimate could be off but 10 years I’ve look like an asshole trying to megaphone my car to come to me through telepathy.

Same with the charging port. Different regulations in different places.
"Yeah, my European Model S I have to be right beside the car for it to work. "
"This is correct, in Europe the key fob needs to be near your car. Next to that, you can only use the summon feature using the app, not the app or the key fob like in the US."

"Emphasis on ""advertised"" (even though I'd like to see that advertisement). If you ask me it is not safe/reliable/feasible to summon your car at the entrance of the parking lot while you exit a shopping center or something like that. In the future I am convinced cars will do just that with no supervision from humans but until then we're stuck with using ""Summon"" for entering/exiting a very tight garage or taking the car out to a quick rain shower from your office.

Congrats for the car. Are you gonna be able to afford the Model 3 as well ? What's your work ?"

Oh don't worry. They're still going.
The worst part is I don't even think it's even really a scam. The creators seem to actually think it's a great idea...

Is this an updated feature? I know cars driving without someone in the driver's seat only recently became legal.

Belgium is slowly becoming a desert last couple of weeks. 
"Why is that? I think I read somewhere because of the keys didn't support dead-mans switch like in the app (you need to hold the button down). But to be honest, I feel like using the app is not as safe as the fob. I lost connection while summoning, and the car used 3-4 seconds before it noticed it had lost connection to the app, only way to stop it then is to fumble after it in my pocket to press a button to make it stop. That is crazy unsafe (although I don't think the car would drive over someone if the sensors failed to pick up a hindrance, as it frequently stops on the small step outside my garage) "
Last time I heard anything related to them was an interview on Joe Rogans podcast with one of Fred's grand-daughters who left the church.  But it feels like that was probably over a year ago?

allows you to get out and then move into a parking space that you wouldnt normally be able to open the door safely in.
I just realized this feature would be super handy for me in my garage.  It's really tight and hard to get in and out of the car on the one side so this would be really cool to have.  
There was a video of someone using it so that they didn't have to walk through a large puddle that had appeared around their car after it rained.
"some porches have been doing it for a while now. same thing though. just creep forward or backwards. I can't for the life of me see what the point is , well besides what op did "

"And get the car all kinds of scratched up from the people now a few inches away from your car on either side when they come back before you.  

Pointless"
I think it's intended for parking in tight spaces. 
"It's a good feature if you're parked tightly and want to be able to get into your car easily or have a large item you need to load into it.  There's also the cool factor.  It's more of a ""oh look at what it can do"" type thing than anything else I think.  "
The air is dirty
"dirt in the air, and how water has this tendency to pick up dirt because its moist and latches onto anything around it

Except the brits har har
French is the *lingua franca* of France.
"More like: helps you get into your car, after a thoughtless driver parks too close to your door."
"The suggested use is for narrow garages at home, not for parking lots."
When we all have the feature it would make for denser parking.
"well due to it helping the driver get out, that would put the other close vehicle to be the passenger side, which if they have more than any common sense whatsoever, the driver would get in, back up, and let the passenger in."
 **indubitably** 
"what about when the driver gets back to their car first and cant get in?

it always sucks having to put in an insurance claim

its not the money, its the time spent getting it fixed so that your car still holds a decent value when you sell/trade it in"
"Makes sense for the  shoe box sized garages in the Bay Area, but pretentious wank for every other habitable place on the continent"
Once they repaint every car park.  The logistics are just stupid.  You'd get *maybe* a 5% capacity gain where everyone needs the feature to be of use anyway.
You're assuming nobody ever has child passengers.  They don't care
"theres a passenger door also, along with that people park too close on the right sometimes too"
"I'm talking about a situation in which you park in a normal manner, and then some inconsiderate person later pulls into the parking spot next to you without leaving you any room.

If that driver gets back to their car first, then the problem is solved."
"> the driver would get in, back up, and let the passenger in

what?"
"> theres a passenger door also

not sure what you mean by this? for people to climb over and get in that way? inconvient and annoying when theres other options.

and ya, people do park too close on the other side which is annoying."
"i guess im talking about a situation where someone takes a tight parking space figuring they can just summon their car to get in and out

or even a situation where another driver pulls into a spot giving themselves enough room since no one is in the spot to their right and their passenger can get out, until they come out of the store and now the spot to the right is taken. also instead of being a conscientious person and pulling out to let their passenger in they are arrogant assholes who say ""well fuck that guy for parking so close to me"" and dents your car for their mistake

i get that this has never happened in the history of cars, but its nice to futureproof"
"You're making up a solution to a problem that doesn't really exist just to justify the feature.  It's cool, not useful."
"meaning that even if parking is tight and you can use summon to get your car out of the spot theres still some dude parked too close on the passenger side who will dent your car to get into his own

dudes not going to wait for you to return your car and summon it out of the spot just so he can go home to his shitty family where his wife bitches him out at the door for not getting the right sized orange juice, little timmy doesnt shit on the floor because he forgot the tendies, and dont forget little molly, because little molly is the crazy one who will slit their necks in their sleep because she has separation issues because daddy didnt get home quick enough

DO YOU SEE THE SLIPPERY SLOPE THIS TAKES?

THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FIND A MAN IN THE ALPS"
Summon is useful for getting *out* of a tight parking spot. Not for getting *into* one.
"except its a problem that does exist and i've had to deal with plenty of times, and have seen people doing plenty of times."
"are... are you ok? blink twice if she's behind you.

seriously though, if you dont give the person beside you any room to get in, its kinda you're fault and the spot was too small anyways. you should have room for at least 1 side to have a door open."
im only guessing it can do the opposite as well
"That's a bold faced lie.  I've driven a wide two door car for over a decade in the city.  Not once have I needed this feature to properly park.

You're allowed to be even a tiny bit critical of Tesla, just so you know."
"im just worried about your cars resale value

and your neck, because fuck little molly, bitch is crazy as fuck"
All cars can do a lot of things that aren't useful.
"well you're pretty fuckin lucky, or dont pick tight spots, cause my family has had to let passengers out then park due to this several times, and i've had to do this myself once or twice in only 5 years of driving.

> You're allowed to be even a tiny bit critical of Tesla, just so you know.

tesla wasnt the first to do this you know, and i liked that feature just as much then aswell."
"havent dented it yet, since i let passengers out BEFORE going into a tight spot."

* It's not the most sold vehicle (I'd argue a Camry or F150 would deserve that spot)
* It's not particularity revolutionary or amazing price point for high performance or some other metric (Nissan GTR). Bugatti Veyron would win on performance.

Great choise of course but I think that in the future most people will agree that the Model 3 is the car of the decade.

dark?

1990s: Mazda Miata"
The Miata is the best selling sports car of all time and beloved by all?
Own a 90s car. Can confirm
I think it started in the early 70s with the emission laws and the gas crisis.  Manufacturers had to put a bunch of anti-smog equipment on cars along with trying to make them lighter for mileage.  They didn't thoroughly test a lot of the plastics.  Remember dash mats?  They were popular because everyone's dash was cracked.
I'm sorry - a ~Dodge Caravan~ was the car of the 80s? How could you pass up a 1983s Chevy Camaro z28?
"The 90s had a Miata, i think the MR2 is better than a miata but still the mx5 is the second coming of jesus"
I agree. The ‘87 Buick GNX only came in black. 
the 30s will look back and say the 00s and 10s were a dark time too probably
The Buick Grand National is the one redeeming grace of the 80's.
"> or amazing price point for high performance

I don't think the ZR1 deserves it either. But I don't agree with this.

The ZR1 was an insane amount of performance for the price you paid. In 2009 638hp was an absolutely ludicrous amount of power for any car at any price. For reference, the Lamborghini Murcielago SuperVeloce at the time was making 670hp and started at $480,325. At the time the most powerful Ferrari was the Enzo at 660hp and is started at $670,000. Meanwhile, the ZR1 was $103k.

 But the ZR1 didn't just have power, it had lap times that were insane for its price. For example, it's Nurburgring time was 7:19.63. For reference, a brand new 2018 Ferrari 488 GTB ($350k) runs a 7:21.00  9 years later. Even on other tracks, the lap times it set 9 years ago are still pretty respectable today. "
"-Veyron is a multi million dollar bespoke exotic. ZR1 was barely $100k.

-The ZR1 also competed head to head on the Nurburgring with the Carrera GT, the Enzo Ferrari, and the Zonda F. The ZR1 also held better lap times than the Nissan GTR until 2010. Even then, the 2012 GTR beat the 2012 ZR1 on that track by half a second. The only posted Veyron laptime is 7:40, the ZR1 did it in 7:26, then in 2012 in 7:19. Straight line power isnt everything. The ZR1 cost significantly less than all these cars, par the GTR, and performs on par with all of them or outperforms them.

Thats the exact reason why the GTR is ridiculously popular. Its cheap and outperforms most exotics."
This is the car industry we're talking about. The next ~~year~~ decade starts in the last third of the previous one.
"We can call it a day. I doubt anything that would surpass the Model S’s influence would be released by December 31st, 2019. "
"Unless Apple unveils a car in a year, we pretty much know what cars which brands will make from now until 2020."
"I used to use Hagerty on my Datsun 240Z before I switched to USAA for the rest of my cars and USAA required me to switch to their own collector car insurance. They're known for being car enthusiasts who take good care of their members. In this case I had a stated value policy where I promise not to drive to work or more than x miles per year and if anything happens to the car they pay the agreed amount. 

A really cool thing that Hagerty once did is to reach out to classic car owners like me with a manual transmission. They realized that driving a manual was becoming a lost skill in the US and wanted to give young people some experience with them. The idea was to use a large parking lot and give people a chance to drive that classic Mustang or Corvette in a safely controlled environment. 

While it's obvious that their future business relies on people being able to drive these cars they were quite clear that was the intention. I thought it was a great idea."
"They are huge in the world of classic cars. I, and everyone I know with a classic car, uses them for insurance. Hagerty News is also fantastic. They sponsor classic car Motorsports events like the Great Race (which I just participated in). This company is legit run by car geeks.

I actually think this is a really big deal."
I don’t see what’s so special about the model 3 compared to the S. It’s slightly cheaper at the moment but no car for the masses yet. The model S sold enough to be the first mass produced electric car that enthusiasts wanted. The 3 is more of the same. 
"Shorts: “Model 3 a failure! Couldn’t even compete with its’ grandfather the Model S for Car of the Decade”

"
Found the guy who didn’t buy a Model S. 
"I dunno, it's still too expensive to really be mass-market. 

I really want to see what Tesla could do with no luxury or over-engineered features like the popout door handles. Get it to the price of a decently equipped Honda Civic plus the difference in the battery costs and we're talking. "
Probably next decade. Sure it's made this decade but won't really be prevalent in the market till the 2020's.
I think car of 2020’s. 
Maybe car of the *next* decade.
"That last paragraph really hits it home though. The Model S was absolutely revolutionary. The Model 3 is too because of how many more people it reached, but seeing the Model S be successful was like a new awakening."
"Considering the Miata is on there, I don't think the 3 is going to surpass the S for this award."
"Don't know why everyone loves the S or the 3 over the X, which is Telsa's best car"

"Idk, but I’m very much looking forward to the new roadster "
"Probably about the same as everyone who’s owned both a Tesla and an equivalent-price Porsche. One’s dead reliable with a beautiful and ergonomic interior, built with painful attention to detail whose value routinely appreciates with time. The other’s a Tesla. And yet Tesla gets car of the decade? It’s hard for me to call something the car of the decade when all that’s special about it is the power train and the halfway-there autopilot. Tesla’s cars are not reliable. Their interiors belong on cars 2/3 the price. They don’t handle great. Etc."
How could you possibly say that when there are still like 82 years left?
"We're only 20% through the century though. 

You usually wait until the end of that century before assigning awards. 

I'm sure Tesla will come up with something even more groundbreaking by then."
Nope 
"Why stop there? Car of the millennium!

It's still early. But I think it's safe to say no future flying cars are going to top it."
/s? 
"Eh- maybe the 3.... we still have a ways to go. Who knows what will happen in the next 82 years. Maybe someone will build a new, insane, electric flying delorean. "
"I could see the Semi taking it, because it has the potential for an earth shaking change in a huge industry.

If it saves the companies money in fuel cost, they'll stampede to switch.

The roadster is just the halo car. Looks like tons of fun, but it's main job is just to show what can be done with EV, not to really upend an entire segment."

"Although Hagerty might indeed have an American bias, there is a Mercedes-Benz on the list:

"Try to look outside of yourself. Look at the world around you.

"The 1980s saw the emergence of the American ""minivan"" and the Dodge Caravan (along with rebadged Plymouth Voyager) pioneered this market.

Quality or not, you can't argue that they weren't impactful or iconic for the time. My mother drove 3 generations of caravans throughout the 80-90s."
"What, you don't find yourself constantly lusting after an 89 dodge caravan? Truly, one of the worlds greatest collector cars."
"Those cars are the greatest game changers. Minivans might not be sexy, but the Caravan started a new market segment that's still going strong today.

Great isn't the word they should have chosen.  

This is their reasoning:. 
>No, we haven’t lost our marbles. Just hear us out. The original Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager isn’t just a minivan, it’s the minivan. There were attempts in the past, but the Caravan/Voyager got the formula just right and essentially started the minivan as a separate and ultimately very popular segment of the car market. Millions have been sold since, and while the crossover SUV has been on the rise in more recent years, minivans are still very popular (nearly half a million sold last year), and countless Millennials spent huge chunks of their childhood horsing around in the vast expanse that is the back of a minivan."
"It was the 80's and we were doing a shitload of coke, ease off our nuts."
2020s: Tesla Roadster 2
"I dont think people really realize how incredible the ZR1 was when it came out. Chevy took it to the 'Ring in 2008 and it did a 7:26.4 lap. That doesnt seem like much but the Enzo Ferrari came a month later and did 7:25.21. The ZR1 also beat the Carrera GT lap times(7:28 and 7:28.71, neither were conducted by Porsche). In fact, the ZR1 held a better lap time than the GTR did in 2008 and 2009. For America, the ZR1 was insanity as a factory car."

Easy. Because it was fugly right outta the gate
"Ah, the 83s. I remember those semesters well. The last half of freshman year was pretty good because I transferred out of a jock-infested, cheerleader coach-“taught” English class into one where I didn’t necessarily learn much more, but at least I didn’t have pencil shavings dumped on my head any more.

Sophomore English in the Fall was okay because I sat behind and just to the right of a kid who made this epic drawing on his notebook cover. It took him all semester and had maybe an elf resting against a tree with maybe a thousand leaves. Those leaves took quite a long time to draw and color. That kid grew up to be a Navy fighter pilot."
"the 80s/early 90s really did belong to the mini van

">car of the 80s? How could you pass up a 1983s Chevy Camaro z28?

"Yep, the fact that was the car of the 80s makes me think this ""car of the decade"" award is bullshit and meaningless"
"The zr1 was, and probably still is, the cheapest car you could buy new that would do 200, by some margin. While that doesn’t make it the most influential car of the 00s, that is a big deal in my mind"

The 3 is more affordable than the S but quite a ways from mass market appeal.  
Worst case we see the actual $35k version for sale by 2020."
I had the loaner S for over a month while they were dealing with my 3. Overall I prefer the 3 more than the S because of the minimalism. The only thing I miss on the S is summon which is coming to the 3.
Model 3 is designed for full autonomy....
"If reliability has these cars going 200k, they will go the way of Toyotas and have a high resale value with 100k miles compared to European and American cars which depreciate more. "
"When the 35 k model is out though and perhaps becomes even cheaper due to economies of scale and cheaper batteries that might be shift.

Edit: I dont feel it's more of the same; its twice and cheap as a Tesla S and X and possibly 3 to 4 times cheaper in the future. Its far more attainable then the 100K cars that are S's and X's, especially by the middle class."
"Minimally-configured it's $25k less = 1/3rd less than an entry-level Model S while offering 20% more range (the thing which non-EV owners seem to be the most apprehensive about). You could buy another (non-Tesla) car with the savings. At what point does something go from 'slightly cheaper' to 'considerably cheaper' for you? O\_o

Edit: Changed ""$25k"" to ""$25k less"" for clarity, because apparently people thought I was claiming the Model 3 starts at $25k. If you want to buy a Tesla today, Model 3 starts at 49k = \~25k cheaper than the entry-level Model S (which is what, about 75k?). That's \~1/3 less."
Have they fixed/upgraded the laggy/slow touchscreen in the S though?
I had a loaner S for a week and honestly I like the 3 better.  Only think I liked more about the S was the automatic suspension.
"Another question is if tesla really *wants* to go to the bottom part of the mass market. A lot of the design decisions (protected battery pack, large battery pack, aluminum construction for low weight) really push it up in price bracket. A lot of the other features are there to make the high price more ""worth it"". 

To go to a really low price, they may need to compromise on battery pack or crash safety, or at the very least range. None of those are things that I think they want to do. "

"I'm a huge Porsche fan, and I'm in general pretty critical of Tesla. You could say I'm biased, but Porsche didn't push the whole industry forward like the model S did. "
"I'm not saying that Porsche doesn't make amazing cars, because they obviously do. I'm literally wearing a 356 Tshirt as a write this. 

But which 911 has changed the auto industry?  Porsche has made fantastic, iconic cars, but they aren't breaking any molds. They've literally been making the same car since 1975!

Porsche is like AC/DC. I love that band and their great album that they've made 17 times.

"It’s not about performance or quality, but the impact on automotive industry. There were expensive electric sports cars and crappy, ugly “eco” cars, but model S was the first car to show that eletric cars are the future, no matter what your taste in cars are. Model S was also the first car to have some form of autopilot, albeit not a completely autonomous one.

Honestly the only car that could change autonomous industry as much as model S in this century is the hover car. But we aren’t even close to making one, they would probably require new physics dicoveries or fushion engines so small and efficient you could put them in a car."

"The Alfa Romeo Stelvio which is the record breaking SUV is pretty and the co2 emissions for the model that did the record are 210 g/km, so that answers my question but why is it that no one can answer my question in such a big discussion thread about the model s? "
"> A high priced car that won’t be able to charge anywhere usefullll.

That's greatly exaggerated. There are quite a few CCS charging stations already. In addition, Ionity (a joint-venture of BMW, Daimler, Ford and the Volkswagen Group)  is currently building up a charging network in Europe and VW's ""Electrify America"" is doing the same in the US.

> Tesla’s super charger network

Sure, that's a huge advantage right now. I'm not a big fan of proprietary charging networks though. Hopefully, Tesla will also embrace CCS at some point in the future.

> over the air updates

Considering that they can save quite a bit of money by switching to OTA updates, it's no big surprise that other manufacturers plan to support OTA updates as well in their new vehicles.

> autopilot

After all, that's still just an SAE Level 2 system. The Volkswagen Group (to which Porsche belongs) claims that one of their cars (the newest iteration of the Audi A8, to be precise) already has a Level 3 system. The Porsche Taycan will have a Level 4 system if I'm not mistaken.

"It'll be next year for $35k, that's practically certain, however, I do agree with the point that even at $35k, it's not exactly for ""masses"".

I see it as more of a competition for BMW 3 series, Mercedes C class, and Audi A4-5's, etc. 

For the similar dollar, the Model 3 is certainly more appealing in its own class."
"Also, ""average price"" means the average is likely increased by those who buy much more expensive cars.

The median price is probably less than $25,000. Maybe even less than $20,000."
I love my 3 but I felt like I was a bit baited by the 35k figure and the 2 year long wait. I guess I had the option to wait another year but I really needed a replacement for my 95 accord.
Like the S? I’ll believe it when I see it. 
Not really relevant to the thread. 
When it’s out.
"None of those things are true. The base price is $35k, which is more than 1/3 the cost of a base S, and the short range battery has a range of 220 miles, which is significantly less than the 75D’s 265 miles of range."
Please do that math for us?
"Screw all you folks who downvoted me and jumped down my throat because you misinterpreted what I wrote.

People got hung up on the ""$25k = 1/3rd less"" and took that to mean that I thought the Model 3 started at $25k. That makes zero sense in context. If a Model 3 were $25k, it would be 2/3rds less than an entry-level Model S. Further, if you bothered to read the rest of the sentence **it's clear that I was referring to the long-range Model 3**, not the future $35k version.

If you want to make the argument that a minimally-configured Model 3 is $35k, fine. I don't agree with that until you can order it, but different opinions are cool. But don't downvote me because you don't know the price of a Model 3 with ""20% more range"" ""than an entry-level Model S"", and/or can't calculate that there's a $25.5k/34% price difference."

"Literally the same car since 1975? Porsche hasn’t even produced a 911 since 1989. Every single car Porsche has produced going back a *long* way has set the standard for all others in that market segment. And every time they put out a car, it vastly surpasses anything on the market in one or more ways. Do you remember when the PDK was the *only* good dual-clutch? Do you remember when they put rear-wheel steering in the 991? Variable vane turbochargers? The list is actually quite long.

And innovating in the market segment is not the measure of a good car, at all. The measure of a good car is how well it combines technologies to create a reliable machine that’s as near to perfect for the job as possible at the price. Porsche does this extremely consistently.

Every car that Tesla has made, Porsche does better. Basically your argument is that since Porsche has been doing it better for longer, they’re like a washed up classic rock band? You’re thinking of Cadillac lol. Porsche today is better than they’ve ever been."

No one answers your question because the ring time isn’t relevant. Nobody cares about the Stelvio because it’s 5 seconds faster than a Cayenne in the ring.

"Appreciate the though out reply.

I do know about the networks being built. And some of them will support the taycan at full power. It will be interesting to see how these companies price in the demand charges associated with high power charging 

As for OTA. I stand by my point. The legal showdown between OEMs and dealers to actually allow OTA updates is going to be unlike anything we’ve seen in a longggg time. You already have EVs needing a fraction of the maintenance that dealers live on. They have everything to lose and I promise you the battle will be ugly. They have a ton of influence and will willingly cede NO ground on the laws that protect them. Right now it is very very illegal for OEMs to update cars once their sold. That will be a very hard, if not impossible thing to change.

And that means autonomous features on OeM cars will be impossible to implement. I don’t see a scenario where a system is capable of being put into production without regular updates and tweaking. Tesla has been able to roll out in pieces in a way no other OEM legally can. 


Lastly, the high price reference is because these cars are for a small subset of the population. Porsche has no plan to make an affordable EV. They will make a great car, but it’s volume will match the S at best in a market segment that is growing rapidly everyday and has plenty of room for both

$35k was just above my price range as a full time professional with very few bills and good credit. I’m right at the upper end of “the masses” as far as my income to expense ratio, but $30k is really about the top of my comfortable budget.

When it’s realistic for a high school / college student to stretch their budget to afford one (in the $20k-25k range), then I’d personally consider it “for the masses”. Other people will have other ideas of what that price range would be.

But it can’t be denied that Tesla has made HUGE strides in getting to the point where they can offer a vehicle at almost every price point. I’d bet that they’ll have offerings everywhere from $18k-$250k within 10 years. And of course it’s igniting competition across the rest of the automotive market and causing other manufacturers to develop electric vehicles at varying prices (which rocks for consumers)."

"I’d have done the same in your situation.

more so than the S. the minimal interior is so you can jack around in it when not needing to drive it. 
And you can’t buy the 35k version for now. 
"If you can figure out how to give Tesla $35k for a Model 3 today, let me know because I think a lot of people want to do this. Until Tesla sells a $35k Model 3, the base price is not $35k. It's great that they're going to sell it for less at some point, but we live in the present, not the future.

The Model S starts at $74,500. The Model 3 starts at $49k. Hence, the Model 3 is $25,500 or 34% less than the Model S. The syntax of my original post was confusing, I meant it to be read as ""it's ($25k = 1/3rd) less"", not ""it's $25k (= 1/3rd less)"". Language as it's commonly used is squishy, vague, and imprecise.

Of course if you compare the $49k Model 3 to the $74.5k Model S, the range comparison completely flips."
Sure. 74.5 - 49 = 25.5 less. That's about 1/3rd less than a Model S.
Don’t mind the downvotes. It’s Reddit’s way to misinterpret and that’s hard to get away from.  
"It will be 35k. Today, the minimal configuration is 49k, which is 25k less than an entry level Model S."
"What I'm saying is that the gadgets and such don't make a huge price difference compared to the rest of the car, and they make a huge perception difference. 

It's the same thing with a model S. It's expensive because it's made of aluminum and because it has a battery pack that costs $15k+ to manufacture. And yet it was compared to other cars in its price bracket such as Mercedes and BMW. Even with the pop out door handles and giant touch screen it was considered ""not fancy enough"" for the price. 

In other words, perception plays a huge role in how willing people are to pay extra money for an electric car. Most of them see the bells and whistles far more than the underlying technology, even though the bells and whistles are comparatively cheap. "

"I like em too. But Tesla doesn’t have a total monopoly on them either.

When I drive pretty much any recent Porsche, half the time when I touch a switch or knob, I’m thinking “God they were smart to put this here.” I didn’t find myself saying that when I drove a P90D, or the X. As much as the Tesla gadgets are cool, I find it much more satisfying to have a feature-complete car where everything is in the right place and responds exactly how I want it to. I found more of that even in the humble Mazda 3 than I did in the Model S. Which isn’t *that* much of a knock on Tesla, considering how brilliant the Mazda 3 interior layout is, but come on... if you’re going to take on the old guard, you’ve got to at least match them in the places that don’t cost you extra."

"Porsche builds performance cars and luxury GT cars. Things that need a lot of energy to be useable, but can’t afford a lot of additional weight. When they built the 918, which was in development long before the Model S hit the market, they were utilizing the current battery tech to exactly the extent that it would improve performance. It’s not like Porsche wasn’t planning on incorporating electric powertrains into their product line, they explicitly said they were during the 918 development. The reason they weren’t pursuing all-electric cars is because batteries suck in terms of power/energy to weight.

The reason they’re making an all-electric car now has a lot more to do with VW’s diesel scandal than it does with Tesla. It’s a PR move that also happens to more-or-less coincide with all-electric performance cars becoming marketable to Porsche’s clientele. Ie, the performance is reaching a point where there are advantages over hybrids or combustion engines."
"Comments like these are how you know you’ve hit a nerve. If there’s so much wrong with Porsches and there’s still such an obvious disparity between them and Tesla, that really doesn’t reflect well on Tesla."
">Completely wrong - Tesla does a much better job at most things Americans care about. The majority of Americans do no motorsports beyond flooring it between stoplights, and Teslas kick ass at that. Americans like to drive long distances on interstate road trips, and Autopilot kicks ass at that. Americans like to stare at screens instead of the road and the Model S has a gigantic 17"" screen.

I'm not even talking about performance here. If you're over 25 and have done well enough for yourself to own either car, you're probably not going to be flooring anything after your first week of owning the car. Maybe you do it as a novelty for friends and family, but that's a pretty fringe use case.

Teslas kick ass at going distances less than about 250 miles. Americans routinely do more than that. I've never driven long distances with Tesla's autopilot, but I've certainly flown long distances using an *actual* autopilot, and let me tell you, if you want to use Tesla's autopilot safely, it probably will regularly require more of your attention than simply doing it manually. You not only have to worry about other drivers doing the wrong thing, but your own car as well. Driving is predictable, computers sometimes are not. So I'll trade a half-baked autopilot for 5 minute refuels and a 20 gallon fuel tank.

And the 17 inch display was really laggy when I tried it about a year ago. Quite a frustrating experience. Especially when you're used to normal cars and aircraft cockpits where everything has tactile feedback."
"The things I'm talking about are the fun non car things, like waking up to an update that [turns your car into a christmas show](https://youtu.be/k46J7Fq4QJA?t=66), or when it shows you in warp speed mode, or how you can summon the car in and out of a parking space with no one in it. It's the little things that don't relate to the driving experience that I enjoy because they keep it always being fun."

"Yeah, good comparison, I think I agree with you now that the S probably will be the most noteworthy electric car. I’d like to think someone would invent an mode of transport better than electric cars in 100 years time too, which I think is where most of my skepticism comes from. "
"I'd say the Saturn V was a more noteworthy rocket than the Redstone, Soyuz, or any other 1900 rocket, though. First doesn't mean most noteable. The Model T was iconic, but it's at best a debateabke assertion that it's the car of the century."
"Even in the case of the Model S we have to credit electric cars that were created before it, some of them around 100 years ago!"
Good. This is why we shouldn't name it car of the century yet.

Which is something I forgot to mention. Any car accident will turn into a plane crash. 
"I mean, there are ultralights that cost less than cars, the problem is the average dumbshit driver piloting an aircraft would be disasterous.  Where I come from drivers licenses are handed out like candy and people keep them for life with no retesting unless they very severely mess up.  Even still, half the people have issues with land cars, and even simple things like turn signals.  If you added flying into the mix, there'd be people crashing into houses, each other, etc etc.  The technology exists, but the logistics of everyone having them and the amount of air traffic would be an issue.  Think about how bad traffic can be in a city...now imagine how difficult it would be to manage that many aircraft piloted by poorly trained average joe's.  "
"Race times really have no relation to most people’s car ownership experience. Sure enthusiasts like you may care, but most people care far more about comfort, cost to operate, cargo space, beating the other guy off the stoplight, coolness, pollution (less or more for coal rollers), or any of a hundred other things.

Tesla earned car of the decade because it broke new ground in engineering and checked all the boxes for the average person to make it desireable. It proved electric cars can compete with gas, introduced partial driving assistance to the public, and took a radical new touchscreen UI approach. It’s not perfect or even a good track car but it’s influence will be felt by society at large for a long by time."

"I floor it for kicks on on ramps, or passing trucks on highways, or from stoplights if I want to change lanes in front of another car. That’s real world usage and Teslas with electric motors are really optimized for that. Gas engines are less efficient in this regime and really shine in high output for longer periods, like racing or sustained interstate speeds.

I have driven long distances with Tesla Autopilot, including a 2300 mile road trip last week, and it works almost exactly similar to a plane. On boring rural stretches it maintains your lane and speed for you and reduces your workload to worrying about other cars and road hazards. Complex urban areas are different and I found myself driving rather than worrying about autopilot would do, but that’s also similar to a plane. Your workload goes up in crowded airspace with lots of ATC communication and it may be easier to change your course than program all corrections into autopilot.

Finally I agree the touchscreens were a little laggy last year, but it’s been fixed in 2018 and all  models are smooth now, especially the 3. The original screen was pretty solid for a tablet in 2011 but our expectations have changed very quickly.  Regardless, it’s a feature with almost no peers and really shows off how Tesla has a totally different design philosophy than most manufacturers. They are attempting to create a unified, software controlled vehicle while the old guard is still mainly integrating separate systems."

Edit: I'm not suggesting people should use this as a justification to drop an extra $5k. I can't even justify it to myself. I'm driving my own car for a few more years at least."
"You should try driving a few. Anyway chances are if you’re in the market for a Tesla, you’d prefer a Macan. Which at $50k-60k is *far* nicer than any Model X or S.

Accidents caused by the driver getting complacent and the autopilot not responding correctly are the result of a serious issue with this level of automation that Tesla has not adequately declared to its customers. You can be more complacent in most flight regimes than when driving a car, because unplanned deviations from your intended path will virtually never result in you striking other objects at 34,000 ft. You’ve got at least 1,000 ft vertical separation and 5 nm horizontal separation from other aircraft. But when you start getting into terminal airspace, autopilot is nothing more than a hands-free device for flying. It does not reduce the amount of attention required to fly the aircraft. And it’s the same thing with Tesla’s autopilot. I trust Tesla’s autopilot less than I trust FMS autopilot in an aircraft, and I don’t trust that much any time deviations can be fatal. So I disagree with the idea that autopilot is a good thing to have for distance driving. It’s good in aircraft because the cruise environment is low risk in the first place. Cars moving above 45 mph are not ever in such a low risk environment. And far greater code complexity and processing is necessary to make it work in cars. It’d be great if it were perfect and you could actually trust it. But it’s not anywhere near that yet."

">I would strongly suggest you try it before making up your mind.

Yeah, and I think you're probably justified in being confident about its accuracy on rural roads. From my perspective though, autopilot is not very useful, because I hardly do anything but urban driving and highway driving. I'd rather have a simple radar cruise control, where I only have to babysit the computer in one axis. Just out of curiosity, does the Tesla have a radar cruise-only mode?

>That Tesla is making this technology available to the public and causing the industry to debate it is a reason in itself that Tesla was named car of the decade.

There's something to be said about putting state-of-the-art technology in the hands of actual customers. But shouldn't it also be at least *one of* the best cars in the price range? Yes innovation should be rewarded, but attention to detail and commitment to reliability and quality should probably be rewarded more when the sacrifices the car makes for it are minimal. The Model S sacrifices ride quality, interior quality, comfort, handling, range, reliability, and resale value compared to an equivalent-price Porsche or Lexus, in exchange for a half-baked autopilot and an electric powertrain that *can* be faster, but only if you spend another $40,000 on top of the normal P100. And by then you're in Panamera Turbo territory, which in every way besides ~0.5s 0-60 time is completely out of Tesla's league. The ability to recharge in your home is a nice upside, but the increased time to recharge is a significant downside, and I think the two cancel each other out. Lower energy cost for electricity is the one uncontested card in Tesla's hand. Is it worth it?

The Model 3 I'm undecided on, it's a completely different animal. I'm talking strictly about the Model S and X here, since they're closely related and the OP is about the S."
It's the first use of assembly line right ?
"When you said model T I assumed you where referring to a Tesla car. I do know this car, it's the first one to use an assembly line for production. The workers where paid double the normal and most of them couldn't withstand the work until this raise in revenue (which in turn made the workers able to consume Ford model T too)."
I agree 100% with that and Miatas handle very well. Fun to drive no doubt but I would never daily one

"> Just out of curiosity, does the Tesla have a radar cruise-only mode?

Yes, you tap the control stalk once for radar cruise and twice for full autopilot. 

> But shouldn't it also be at least one of the best cars in the price range?

No, it doesn't have to be the best at every traditional measure because it is a revolutionary car that is shaking up the world industry. The Panamera is a really nice car with great numbers but the Tesla is good enough at normal car stuff and does so many new things:

- zero emissions
- first electric car capable of long range travel via supercharging network
- first car with usable touchscreen UI
- first car to deliver semi-autonomous driving to the public
- first car to deliver software as a service with regular OS updates over the air
- dealer free direct sales model
- 0-60 times beating supercars
"
Yes
There isn't a Tesla model T and there never will be.  The entire reason the Model 3 isn't the Model E is because Ford had a model E from back in the day.  The model T will always refer to the Ford Model T
That reminds me of the episode of M.A.S.H where Klinger tried to eat a bicycle.
Quality isn’t just an interior thing. It’s also a reliability thing. Something that Teslas really struggle with... and Porsches don’t.
"Zero emissions, unless you live in one of the many places that still burns fossil fuels for electricity. And if you don’t count the carbon footprint of mining battery materials. Lower emission for most people, but it’s not zero emissions.

Capable of long range travel compared to other electric cars, but not compared to normal cars.

Touchscreen UI is a terrible idea in a moving vehicle.

Yeah, they’re the first to delivery semi autonomous driving.

Software updates... meh.

0-60 times beating super cars *if you spend $140,000.

And you say traditional measure, but it’s not like these things are old-school and going to be swept away by new technology lol. They’re still the things people care most about when buying a car in the price range of a Tesla."

I’ve debated enough. It’s clear you just don’t like them and that’s fine. But the Model S does so many things first or different than everybody else and sells every car they can make. That’s why they won the award the article is about and why Tesla is in the news constantly.
Well the moving part is what made it affective at the time
"Yeah I agree this is going longer than necessary. Look I used to have a much better opinion of Tesla back when the Model S first came out and it was clearly most of the way towards being a credible alternative to combustion engined cars, with advantages. All it needed was a little more refinement. Being a much simpler car inherently than its competitors, I figured reliability wouldn’t be a problem. But after 6 years Tesla hasn’t been able to get itself the rest of the way there. The clock is ticking for the company – if they don’t fill in the gaps, they’ll find themselves surrounded by competitors that found it much easier to build an electric powertrain and license autonomous driving software than Tesla is finding it to catch up everywhere else."
Really nice demonstration 👏👏
"So it can parallel park, but can it unpark itself from said space?"
But will it autonomously honk the horn and flip the other driver the bird when they cut you off?
Correct me if im wrong but i thought Elon said that on the TM3 w/o autopilot enabled the emergency braking and side collision warning would still be available as it is a safety feature?
"Need to change the auto park section showing the car driving by the spot 3 times. Then when the space is finally recognized and you’re 10 feet in front the space praying no one behind you goes for the spot. Finally when you get started it takes forever and adds unnecessary turns. Throw in a curbed wheel. Boom, done. ✅ 

Edit: Just noticed a week later this got gilded. Thanks ❤️ "
 I like how every car around it is another Tesla haha 
"As someone who lives in the city and rarely drives on the freeway, $5k is tough to justify. Any other city dwellers feel like they could pass/wait? "
so do I need EAP to get blindspot warning? seems like that should be standard.
"Can someone parody this --- slow down *just* the autopark portion to about 1/5 the speed?

Edit: I'm serious. Someone? Please?"
"Cool video, but that didn't look like an appropriate amount of space before cutting in front of that model x on the lane change."
had anyone witha model3 received the updates with these features?
I will buy Tesla!!! Promise to myself
"Summon. ""i Call thee forth, oh mighty carriage of steel!"" please tell me that's how you do it. "
"In each clip, all the other cars are a Tesla, except for the last one where all the other cars don't brake in time. Clever little marketing detail."
See? Autopark is really quick!
If only auto lane change would actually change lanes automatically (without having to use the manual turn signals) for you instead of just slowing down to match the car ahead of you...I can’t wait till they enable this to allow the car to slice through traffic

"Only one EAP feature to go! (""Auto Lane Change"")
We are *very* close to the first (of *many*) post-EAP features.

Only those who purchase the FSD package will be able to use these (many, incremental) post-EAP features, for example,

* Traffic lights
* Stop signs
* Yield signs
* Pedestrian crossings
* Zipper-merges
* Actually taking exits
* Turning when the GPS/directions say to turn
* etc., etc., etc.

Of course those are not full-self-driving - you will still need to be in the driver's seat - you will still be the driver. But only those who purchased the FSD package will be able to access them.

Then eventually, after enough of these incremental features are rolled out, Tesla will petition to various governmental authorities to authorize the car to drive itself - full-self-driving. But in the meantime I for one want to enjoy all those many incremental features. Yes I will still need to be the driver, but yes it will be awesome to experience my car getting smarter & smarter & smarter & smarter."
"If these are all the features that will be available with EAP, then I'm sorely disappointed.  The initial description of EAP gave me the impression that the car would handle everything from on-ramp to off-ramp.  So that includes automatic lane change, but it should also detect which lane it needs to be in during the journey so that it stays on the correct route, and takes the correct exit.

Then there's smart summon - the summon that they show is straight line.  Previously, it was smart summon, where it would be able to navigate through a parking area to get to you."
Funny how some of the features like advanced summon have disappeared without a trace 
Last one was impressive 
I don't think I'd ever be comfortable standing in front of my car and summoning it.
"How do I know if my 3 (took delivery June 1) has auto lane change enabled? I didn't even realize it was released yet, I thought it was still a vaporware feature."
"If I don't have EAP, will I still see icons of cars around me on the screen?"
"This is for the 3k upgrade right, not the 5k upgrade?"
Where's the actual link for that on the website?
"Does side collision warning also help you if someone is trying to come into your lane from the front of your car?  Someone almost hit me yesterday when they tried to change lanes into me (they were slightly ahead of me, I was slightly behind them to their left in their blind spot)."
"Sweet! I cant wait for model 3 to come to Sweden. 

My son is infected by my love of Teslas, and are always on the lookout after one when we are on the road. There are one between our house and his school, so when he calls on the way home, he usually say things like “I’m at the Tesla house now”. The best time is when we are at a burger place who have a supercharger outside so he can check them out.

I wish that I could afford a Model S, thats such a beautiful car, but I’ll just have to wait another 1-2 years for model 3 to come to Sweden. It feels like its worth the wait!"
"Powerful presentation, now let's see this on the roads!"
"I just don't even know how to reconcile the image of lane change with the need to constantly supervise the car. How, exactly, am I supposed to know when to look behind to see if the change is safe, and how long do I have to abort the car's move if it is not?

Because if there's one thing Tesla and /r/teslamotors is good at, it's blaming the inattentive driver for EAP crashes. Spontaneous lane change takes that to a whole new level and I have no idea how that feature is in the least bit useful until it can happen without my attention."
 Doesn’t emergency braking only work if the car detects no other alternative for the driver to take? This illustration seems to indicate that it will just do breaking for you even if you could turn left or right to avoid. That’s very different from my current understanding of the feature. 
"If the car realizes it cannot break in time, will it break and swerve to the safest possible position?"
Can you use the summon feature regardless of where it’s parked? I’m envisioning it pulling up to the curb when I’m done at a restaurant or something. 
"I had the weirdest thing the other day. I used this feature and there were no cars around, and my car did not change lanes. I almost go off on the wrong exit due to it not changing. It was not skinny broken lines in the roads but the fat ones. Would that matter?"
"Does ""side collision warning"" move the car a bit automatically or is it only an audio/visual warning?"
Now show what it does when it meets a center divider
"When breaking, should it go as close as possible to the car in front, because you might get hit in the ass."
Auto steer would be a killer features!
so..... how about that sumon..... plz tasla....
Where's a barrier it drives into?
"Hmmm... So the car automatically breaks the law by undertaking. 

Who's liable here?"
"Super cool, but seeing the vehicle automatically changing lanes while accelerating made me think r/nonononoyes. 

I know it's better at it than most drivers, I just have this irrational fear it's gonna send me spinning off the highway at 70mph."
"Too bad autopark never really works.  I used to occasional see the P come up but now it's very rare.  When it does come up, I'm already reversing into the spot myself.  "
"Not yet, no"
"I actually never thought of this before, but the exact same tech could be used to leave the spots. Weird they're not using it. Then again, it's considerably easier for the driver, as you pretty much don't have to control angles at all, backup a bit, turn left, done."

"and just fyi, some people have reported it bumping a car when parallel parking. Most likely due to faulty or damaged censors though. That or it's just people lying trying to make the car look bad"
Would pay for FSD if this was the first feature.
Next update
"Or when you try to parallel park, somebody pulls up on your bumper before you can reverse in, then lays on the horn and makes and obscene gesture."
I’ve used Autopark twice now and it’s worked beautifully each time. Clearly YMMV!
[deleted]
"It hardly ever shows the P to do the autopark for me when I need it to, but it sure as hell shows it quite frequently while sitting in traffic. "
Yeah AutoPark is NOT as smooth as is depicted.
"The thing I can't figure out is how to trigger it, it's only popped up twice for me ever. "
Did a test drive in Fremont Tesla parking lot and couldn't get auto park to work there either! Just ridiculous. 
"This is accurate, and would make for a much more entertaining animation!"
Maybe your speed might be too fast?  I was having trouble with it until it was pointed out that you need to be under 7 mph while you're driving by the spot. 
Very optimistic San Fransisco demo
The future is near!
Except for the one in the side collision slide where it cuts the car off and the slide where the other cars dont break in time.
It must have been filmed in Amsterdam. 
"Hell no. I really want my freaking car to drive for me as much as possible.

But I think you can add it later when you're a little better off financially, right? Which is probably what I'll be doing."
I use autopilot whenever there are clear lines for EAP to easily identify a lane. Highway use is actually quite low compare to other busy roads that often have significant traffic during rush hour. I would never give up autopilot is the one feature i would never give up now that I have experienced it. 
City driver here. I'm going to pass on it for now and possibly add it later. I enjoy driving and don't fully trust the tech or myself at this point. 
"I paid for it and you are right, I wish I could return it"
"From my experience, EAP is great on the highway but not good on city streets.

 When traffic is stopped in front of you, the car doesn't slow down soon enough and it ends up slamming breaks.  

It wobbles too much in the lane and likes to hug to the left too much.  No pothole avoidance. 

I haven't tested it over road humps yet, but I'm nervous to do so because I don't want to hit one at 35. In my town they are designed to be safe at or below 20 mph. "
"No, not sure why they're showing the standard safety features under EAP."
"It should be standard, and it should use the side cameras that are currently reserved for FSD only.  The ultrasonic sensors used by the current blindspot indicator seem to not be very reliable in real world driving conditions."
There is no blindspot warning because it hasn’t even been released yet. Not sure why this isn’t a standard feature. 
"And make it move back a forth a couple times before it finishes.

I don't have my model 3 yet but I thought that would be funny and more realistic to how I sometimes had to park. Haha"
"I was half expecting the ""Emergency Breaking"" to show a car crashing super hard into the back of a fire truck and catching fire."
"I tried, here you go : 
https://vimeo.com/281012076"
"I took delivery yesterday and tried it out. It never auto changed lanes. And one time I guess I didn't press the turn signal hard enough, because right when I let go, it swerved hard back into the original lane."
"My model 3 does all these features, since June delivery. I was a little surprised that ‘this is all EAH is’, but I think that’s it before an August self-driving features update. "
"Yes, has everything except Summon"
"No, I haven't, been patiently waiting since it was first released 3 weeks ago.
This would be really useful for me"
Yes. What features are you missing? 
No. ( yes I’m bitter about this) 
"Not only that, it won't change lanes with the cars that close, at least from my experience."
"Cars are not meant to “slice through traffic” drivers that do that are assholes. If you’ve ever seen the traffic snake gif on Reddit, those are typically caused by this.

Remember kids, stay in your lane. Switch lanes if the guy in front is doing 20 under, or your exit is in 2 miles, but randomly cutting people off in a desperate bid to shave 30 seconds off your commute is not polite or proper.

I’ll eat my hat if Tesla ever condones this behavior with automatic lane changes."
Patience my friend
Is BMW developing this technology? Because that sounds like what you’re looking for. 
"It only currently uses the ultrasonics, until it starts using the cameras, it has no clue if someone is coming up on you quickly."
"Be thankful. We have to put the indicator on, and then hold the wheel for it to move in the UK/EU."
That feature is a part of Enhanced AutoPilot. Coming soon hopefully! 
"Imagine a whole freeway with autopilot cars. If car a at 65 sets a follow distance of 3 in a line of other Teslas, there will be full car gaps in between without V2V communication. One guy sets it to 65 in the slower lane so it cuts into any gap in the chain and it would create a chain reaction of cars going 65 slowing to 60 to increase the resulting gap. This triggers cars with sightly different radar control algorithms or human drivers in the back to change lanes to the previously slower lane and automatically start looking for places to cut back in ahead. It introduces unnecessary churn if every car aggressively looks for gaps. I've already seen this on two lane highways when people start to utilize the following space between multiple Teslas on autopilot, it ends up annoying the people in the back of the line from the constant braking just to play musical chairs, and then people try to pass around the convoy with little safety space by accelerating in the slow lane often slamming on the brakes to cut in. Rinse and repeat."
So you want the asshole mode that won't ever be legal? lol
"Practical point: if you can afford the FSD package ($1.60/day approx.), and if you want to enjoy these many, *many* incremental features, do it - buy it with your vehicle. The first post-EAP feature will likely be coming out soon-ish (perhaps this year, certainly within a year).

Too many people have erroneously written, in these pages, that the FSD package has no value until Tesla gets full-self-driving approved by various regulators. That's just wrong. The FSD package enables you to enjoy the many incremental post-EAP features, and those will start coming out soon-ish. There's only one EAP feature until EAP is done!"
"The advanced park summon thing is part of FSD, not EAP. "
The wording is not right on the site because those features are not EAP. 
You mean that feature that's most likely part of the FSD package that hasn't started rolling out yet? It's going to be a bit still until they feel comfortable enough with it to roll it out to the masses.
"And is the feature that works the least.

\*Edit: Whoops, thought the last one was automatic parking."
You set the length of the summon from your garage but I understand what you mean. Altough I think the sensor detection has inproved over time so humans get sensed easier.
It changes automatically when you active the turn signal while AP is turned on. It doesn’t yet literally do it by itself without any input. 
Yes
This is for enhanced Autopilot (5k). Not full self driving (3k). 
[deleted]
"On the model 3 page, scroll down to autopilot then learn more. "
it does indeed move the car automatically.  there are youtube videos of it happening.
"There have been multiple reports of the car actually moving in the lane, and that is also what the video shows. "
I'm not aware of any official clarification from Tesla on this.
"What?  No. It (and you) should leave a safe and reasonable gap at all times so if some inattentive diarrheadrop hits you, you don’t get pushed into another car and become at fault for that. 

Is this stuff no longer covered in driver training or do they just pass everyone even if they don’t pay attention? "
">but seeing the vehicle automatically changing lanes while accelerating 

Uh.. that's what you're suppose to do when changing lanes. At least what they told me in driving school. "
"You can still set the max speed limit the car will go, no?"
"Having spun off the freeway at 70mph once before in my GTI, I can say it's pretty fun after you realize you are still alive and managed to not crap your pants."
Just stick it in autopilot and wait for all the cars in front to move.
Cant it just do every move it just did to park and reverse it??
"I heard that you can with using summon from the app in the direction of where it came from, but, I only tried twice and chickened out each time :) so can't confirm. This was with AP1 on X90D too, my Model 3 still does not have the summons update. "
"> the exact same tech could be used to leave the spots.

The exact same *turning* tech, but vastly different *safety* tech. Pulling out *into* traffic is much more about safety (not hitting cars as they whiz by) than it is about angles. Backing into an empty parking spot is more about angles - there are no cars whizzing by - the parking spot is and remains empty."
"I don’t, but it seems like with the tech already there they should give people the option, it could be considered an update to the summon feature "
"We are approaching the era where computers can reason far enough to rightfully counter-irritate people who are being assholes on purpose.  When your grandchildren ask you (grandpa) what life was like when you were young, you'll be able to tell your grand children of a hard-to-believe story of the time when computers always followed the instructions from humans, regardless of how bone headed the instructions were, and everyone thought that was completely normal even though tens of trillions of dollars were lost due to it.

Musk says this stuff shouldn't be used for military purposes, but I'll tell you what, eventually this stuff will be the only equipment on the battlefield.  Those who don't or won't will fall like a heap of dry leaves, like a novice before the best chess playing algorithm."
"If I see this update without credit, I’m asking for a free Model S, but I’d settle for a Model 3. "
I think we've always had that problem
"It's okay, I'm patient. I'll wait. "
Every day in LA lol...
"You just have to signal right and come to a complete stop next to the spot first, then _slowly_ pull forward. 

Stop pulling forward if they don't stay where they are, and kinda try it again.

Usually works for me."
"Does it do parallel on both sides of the street? I have it in my Fusion, but it only does the right side! I assume so from this demo. "
"It works great if nobody is around to interrupt it. It goes about its business pretty slowly so if I don't have to worry about others I do it and read my email / facebook, but if others are around, I prefer to self park faster than autopark. "
I can't even get my MS to reliably show spaces to park in. 
"Mine likes to pick up the space like 50 feet behind me. I’m sure I’m doing it wrong, but haven’t had enough time to experiment. "
I do it for perpendicular too. I feel like with the last updates the rate of it identifying a perfectly good spot has gone down drastically.
"You have to be driving really slow (<5mph).  Or better yet, go to a stoplight, and it'll think the gap in the cars also waiting at the light is a great spot to back into!"
"Also lane changing isnt moving from lane to lane as fast as depicted. But future software updates will maybe fix this. It actually used to be much faster a few updates ago, but some people complained about it being jerky etc. I prefer the old style but am looking forward to improvements in the near future. "
"I think the best way to trigger it is being at a stop light, not wanting to parallel park, when it reads a small gap next to you as a spot"
I think I read in the owners manual that you need to have rear camera mode on while driving for it to pop up with the option when you slowly drive past a parking spot. I tried it yesterday and it worked both time for me to back in a spot.
"Depends on your speed and where you are trying to park.  In my experience parallel parking looks for spots below 15mph and it notifies you about 75% past the spot you're going to park in.  This works ok as you would pass a spot you intend to parallel park in anyway, but it's hit and miss which means you slow down a lot for nothing sometimes.  That leads to you speeding away as the park icon comes on and a bad user experience. "
"I saw FIVE Model 3's today on a quick drive from south Seattle to about 4 miles north. I still get excited when I see them, but the excitement is waning, which is a good thing. "
Coincidence? I think not!
You can. I'm doing the same. Also because I spent the extra money on LR battery now...oops.
"I'm deliberating on adding it to our order.  Can you expand on why?  What sort of driving conditions do you use it for, and what's it good and bad at in your opinion.

$5k on dual motor vs. EAP is a tough call, and tbh, the fact that automatic breaking is a standard feature, is directing me towards dual motor.

Thanks!"
"Same goes for AEB, not sure why a safety feature would be behind a paywall if it comes built into the car."
"I think that they don’t process the ultrasonic data properly. The hardware may not let them fix it in firmware, but essentially the ping and pong should be digitized, and a neural network would be the perfect solution for making the sensors work better. That’s what neural nets are very good at. Most likely though, the hardware is a standard automotive ultrasonic sensor that provides a crude “no object” or “distance to object” indication only. "
"I tried : 

https://vimeo.com/281012076"
"Hahaha 

Nicely done, sir"
"If you don’t see the lane lines for the neighbor lanes on your screen then lame change won’t work.  To engage, full press the desired turn signal switch and watch the magic.  It will turn off the turn signal for you at completion."
It only changers Kane’s in divided highways. I have had it swing back to the original lane at times. It must sense something it does not like.  
"Check your AP settings. 

Auto Lane change can be turned on and off. "
"Unrelated, but I’m looking for input from people who received delivery yesterday: 

Did you get kicked off the app? My at-home delivery person said “it’s just a thing: sometime tonight, the app will log you off and say there’s no car on your account. It’ll work again in 2-3 days”. 

It happened and it sucks :(. "
"It’s not about pressing it hard enough, you have to keep it pressed until you’re almost fully in the new lane. 

I stand corrected, apparently if you press hard enough to engage it further than the usual 3 blinks it’ll do a full lane change and turn off. I’ll try this today. "
It doesn't have summon?! that's the one feature i wanted
"The summon update was stopped for a bit to fix bugs, which is the whole point of a staggered rollout. They are now pushing it again. "
Your service tech can push the update to you. Mine did yesterday. I finally have summon.
Summon is in the update that's been a little slow to roll out. 
Unless we get the Mad Max mode. 
I'm quite happy it doesn't as that would be extremely uncomfortable. 
Agree 100%. [Here's an excellent explanation which demonstrates what happens when you do things like that.](https://youtu.be/iHzzSao6ypE?t=1m2s)
Mythbusters tested this once and they arrived like 2-3 minutes ahead of the car that never changed lanes once. (And very stressed out about driving like maniacs)
"This wouldn't be a problem if people stopped cruising in the left lane.  


Remember kids if you are in the left lane and not actively passing someone get over! "
"Not even 30 seconds likely!

"
thank you
The rest of the [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHzzSao6ypE) of the 'traffic snake gif' I think you're referring to is also pretty relevant to this discussion.
">Remember kids, stay in your lane. Switch lanes if the guy in front is doing 20 under, or your exit is in 2 miles, but randomly cutting people off in a desperate bid to shave 30 seconds off your commute is not polite or proper.


Not to mention, it also doesn't lead you to you getting there [any faster](https://lifehacker.com/does-speeding-really-get-you-there-any-faster-1556767685), at least not significantly."
"Water does this for higher throughput, works fine in nature."
"I don’t think they’re saying the car won’t use turn signals, but it will change lanes automatically using the turn signals on its own rather than you having to activate the signal to initiate the lane change. "
Ultrasonics and radar
">and then hold the wheel

Like you're supposed to be doing anyways?"
"Advanced summom, (garage to front door on private property) used to be (edit: [and still is](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot) ) advertised for enhanced AP."
"No, he means the feature that was/is advertised as being part of EAP. "
Emergency braking works the least?
"Yeah but I've never seen the lines showing the adjacent lane. Do I need to do something to enable it? Should the lines appear when AP isn't engaged? I don't use AP much because I don't find it very useful, though auto lane change might change that.

Would have been nice if they taught me this stuff when I picked up the car..."
"Sorry somehow I was confused, I thought thought Enhanced auto pilot was 3k and full self driving was 5k.  I see I had those mixed up, thanks!"
"Sweet, thanks!"
Any with video confirming the driver didn't move the wheel?
"Serious question, does it move the car even if it can't see/resolve the lane it is moving into? what if you are driving next to a cliff and someone pass near you?"
"As a European, that clip of overtaking on the right and then changing lanes on the highway is really cringe to me.

White car should either be overtaking the other white car or in the right lane to allow the red car to pass. That's all."
"Yeah, overtaking on the right will get you a fine in most EU countries. You can pass someone if you're already on the right and they're going slow, but ""overtaking"" is not allowed. Which is probably a good idea because it reduces chaos a bit and it's one less variable to control, but only works if people do try to drive on the right lanes.

You can also be fined for driving on the left when the right lanes are free."
"It's absolutely what you're supposed to do, not sure why they thought that was a bad thing"
r/ShittyLifeProTips 
My model 3 got the summon update about a month ago.  Do you have the WiFi update yet? Maybe try connecting to WiFi in case you have crappy cell coverage where you park at night.
"And judging by how we've not yet have things like blind spot alert, and the fact that the rear cameras probably doesn't look that far like the front one, and that whatever camera there currently is in car isn't as good as spotting cars whizing by, the unpark feature probably would need some add'l cameras and/or hardware..."
Especially when I already had my blinker and reverse lights on.
Yes it does
Wait what year of fusion has that D:
"For the 3at least you kinda just have to learn what it wants. Drive really slow, under 5mph and go close to the car before and the one after said spot, close enough so the ultrasonics are in range to see it and once you see the P hit it in reverse and you're Golden."
"You can also be on the freeway with concrete to the right of you.

Given how useless it is right now I'm not sure I'll ever trust it if it does start vaguely working someday."
"Well it can't be required, because it has done it for me when in reverse and mostly standstill (backup camera on?). Besides those two times, I can't repeat it. "
Wasn't a tough call for me. I can get eap later. Can't change my mind about dual motor.
It’s not there yet but calling it “lame change” is harsh :)
"I wish it would indicate when auto lane change was possible so I don't look like a dumbass engaging my turn signal and then not changing lanes. Newly striped and paved highway and stupid auto lane change doesn't want to auto lane change.

Edit: You guys are responding like I'm insane or something, so I'll just have to take some photos of my screen to show you next time I'm on that highway. For the record, I use auto lane change ALL THE TIME. I know what I'm talking about and it just doesn't work on this one stretch."
"> It will turn off the turn signal for you at completion.

It will? It doesn't on my AP1 S"
"It's also tied to your driver profile. I didn't realize this at first, and couldn't figure out why it would do auto lane change when I was driving but refused when my wife was driving. The setting was off!"
"Yup, happened to me too (at-home delivery on Wednesday July 18th).  Ended up emailing about it, and got ""it's normal"".  Which it sounds like is technically true...

It came back this (Friday) morning."
"Nope. I connected to it while waiting in the lobby and haven't disconnected since 😬

Pixel 2xl on Android 9."
"I found that if I press it all the way down so that the signal light stays on, it changes lanes then turns the signal light off."
Yeah and if you let up too soon it will jerk your butt back into your original lane very aggressively. You have to get at least 3/4 through the lane change or you're in for a rough ride.
"You're not crazy, I thought this too."
"Haven't received the latest update yet, but we have everything else"
Don't phone them for this. Just wait.
Yeah. Bug fixes on Tesla's end. I had to get my charge cable replaced yesterday and they pushed it to me. Not a ton of practical applications of summon for me. 
That’s pretty but it doesn’t quite jive with where the problem is: the drivers who over-brake. They do because they brake too late. 
"Depends on the type of traffic. Gridlocked traffic usually doesn't make a difference what lane you're in...slower like 55mph average traffic if you do some weaving, you can really make up some time.."
If I'm going 80 in the left hand lane and you're tail gaiting me you can fuck the fuck off. 
"Correct, but the idiot water leaving a huge gap doesn't then slow down even more when other water starts driving in front of it.

The ways that people act differently from water is three issue.The biggest problem is the ""accordioning"" of traffic caused by people having poor reaction times and varying following distance with speed. 

If you look through the car in front of you to the car in front of them, you can react to the same stimulus as the driver in front of you, effectively cutting the reaction time for your two cars to that of one car. Also lets you follow a bit closer unless the dude in front of you is tailgating the person in front of them, because you're really following the car in front of the car in front of you. 

It's more about seeing the big picture and trying to improve flow. Use all lanes, change into faster lanes, don't merge early when a lane closes ahead of you, zipper merge where merging occurs, etc. Jams happen when throughput can't keep up with desired flow. Anything that increases throughput is good. Be like the water"
"We don't have evidence that there's working radar in the rear.

There are some photos that suggest Tesla may have added a rear facing radar in the Model 3 but we don't know much about it."
Sure. Just explaining ha
Ah that's my bad. I was thinking it was the feature where the car finds a place to park when you arrive somewhere then comes and picks you up.
"It's working but still not as good as many other OEM systems out there. There is a lot of room to improve.
(talking about AEB when not in autopilot mode) "
"Yeah, no, my bad. Meant automatic parking. Forgot it scrolled further right."
"Did you purchase the AP option when you ordered your car? I’m assuming you bought it and have it, otherwise it won’t work.

[Model 3 Auto Lane Change](https://youtu.be/m0hfOZqf-PA) "
"No, all dashcam stuff that won't show the wheel.   But it's a well known feature, it's real.  The car will do a slight dodge to avoid a side impact. 
"
It won't move you out of your marked lane.
Welcome to my largest pet peeve of driving (US) .... Everyone wants to own that left lane regardless of speed. I probably pass more people on the right than the left these days. It's bad. 
Plus the red car should accellerate first. Then merge. Otherwise the leftlane car will slam on the brakes. This demo looks dangerous for europe drivers.
Puhleeze. I live in Asia where mopeds pass on the right while I make a right turn. Buses make left turns from the right lane. It’s so comical I don’t get mad anymore. 
"I wish they would ticket for this in the US.  And for following too close.  There's an epidemic of both, but police around here don't seem to understand that traffic enforcement involves anything other than speed limit enforcement and stop sign enforcement."
"And it does it rather well, just I find it still too slow in its sideways motion. "
"I also don't have the wifi update. I was even one time going down to the SC and thought it may have connected to wifi there, but then it said something like no connection, i.e. it didnt work, and I ran out of time as it was on the way to work and just let it go. 

But I heard the update that I would have gotten at the time increased the nags for autopilot and since I rely on that a lot in commute traffic, maybe I am better off waiting for the next refined release."
"> the unpark feature probably would need some add'l cameras and/or hardware...

Shouldn't need additional cameras and/or hardware - the AP2 hardware can see 360-degrees. But it will def. need some careful software. 

Certainly the unpark feature will be a post-EAP feature (it's def. not listed in Tesla's EAP-feature-list), thus available only to those who purchase the FSD-package.

"
"If you are joking, lol. If you are serious, my 2013 Energi Titanium has 'Active Park Assist'. Works 70% of the time, right side only. "
"Good logic, I think I’ll follow."
It does... it will only change lanes if the lanes are displayed on the neighboring lanes on your screen.  
The turn signal stalk on the Model 3 is different from the S.
It does.
Only on the model 3
"Huh, really? That's really odd. Will have to check this and see if that's why it wouldn't work when my boyfriend was driving, but worked fine for me..."
Having the app for 12 hours (exactly... that must be the threshold for the initial activation) was such a tease. 
"Hm. Thanks for the info—it was strange when she explained it, but I hadn’t read anything about the bug. It might have something to do with at-home deliveries, but I don’t see how that would make sense. "
Yep
"> then turns the signal light off

oh. that's nice. My (AP 2.0) Model S doesn't turn it off after completing the lange change. That would be kinda nice to have."
"Yup, fully engage the turn signal and lane change will occur. I usually cancel the turn signal when I’m 3/4’s into the lane because I feel like the turn signal stays on too long once the car is fully in the lane. "
"I didn't need to. My mobile tech was fixing my charge port door, I asked him about it, he said I can push it no problem. "
why?
"What were the bugs?    

Are they gone now that you have it?"
Can't know someone will cut you off until they do.
Why not just move over for the faster traffic?  Number 1 rule of defensive driving don't get in an idiots way.
"Slower traffic keep right(perhaps you've heard the phrase). I don't care what speed you're going, if people behind you are going faster you're in the wrong lane. It busts me up that you think you get to decide how much over the speed limit is the right amount. "
"This will, hopefully, be a non-issue if the majority or cars were autonomous."
"Agreed. Whenever practical, I try to drive by seeing the second or even third+ car in front of me. I'll see what they are about to react to and react in a correct way. Like if the guy in front of me is speeding up to close the gap but is heading for a segment of stopped traffic, I won't be speeding up with him. "
Which makes no f'ing sense if they haven't because it's the best way to handle blind spot detection. My minivan has two rear facing radars for that purpose and it's great. And it predates AP1 even. 
"I somehow totally missed the part where you were talking about someone coming up from behind - yes, there is no confirmation that rear radar exists, though I do remember someone seeing a harness which could likely be for a future implementation    "
"Ah, yeah, that is probably full FSD, but smart summon is supposed to happen. Its actually still advertised on [Teslas AP page](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot) right before they talk about FSD. Honestly, with the way its worded, it sounds like it should be able to navigate a parking lot to come pick you up, but not park itself."
Well my car has almost eaten a side collision many times without doing any such evasive maneuver.  I'm skeptical.  Can you point to a statement from Tesla claiming avoidance rather than just a warning?
"A couple of days ago I experienced it happening; the wheel pulled hard and moved me a few inches to the right to avoid a lone random traffic cone that was sitting alongside the road.  It wouldn't have hit it anyway, and was taking me closer than I'd have liked to the car next to me."
"I try to be conscious of staying in the right lane if I'm not passing people...but then I frequently get stuck in the right lane behind someone going 5mph under the speed limit as people ""parked"" in the left lane pass by, too closely packed together for me to merge.

Another motivator for not being in the right-most lane...I really dislike how autosteer needs to center itself between lines at on/off ramps. Sometimes it makes me wonder if other drivers think I'm drunk 😣"
"I've started honking at them (polite, short bursts) rather than overtaking on the right to start. If they don't get the hint I'll still overtake, but these people need to understand that they're violating a number of traffic laws, depending on what state they're in. Besides breaking laws, they're also making a more dangerous environment for everyone around them. So even though I've never heard of anyone else honking at people in this situation, I think it's more than justified, and when they do get the hint and move over, they usually stay over after that, and everything flows much smoother."
"Same here in Canada.

At this point I don't want to correct anyone because when there's 3 lanes the rightmost lane is mainly empty.

People will literally bunch up in the left lane, and struggle to pass the semi trucks in the middle lane, while the right lane remains dead empty.

It's funny blowing past everyone in the right too, because in my mirrors I can see them all having the realization of ""Oh right, we're supposed to keep right"" or ""Oh, an empty lane, why the hell am I sitting in traffic in the leftmost one"" as they put on their signals and move over."
Maybe you should obey the law so you wouldn't need to be passing that much.
"No, the epidemic is left lane camping"
"Note: I'm not saying unpark will require full-self-driving. There's a difference between:

* ""FSD package"" (which gives you access to *all* the *many* post-EAP features, even during the time when you must still be in the driver's seat),
* ""full self driving"" (the end-state after (1) all the many post-EAP features and (2) governmental authorities approving the car to drive itself)."
"Must only be a titanium thing, I have a 2016 energi and it doesn’t have that"
"No, it doesn't. Lanes are displayed, cars in the other lane show up as I pass them, but auto change lane refuses to work in some cases."
Sure if you are getting stuff done already. But people keep phoning. 
Because they are massively over stretched as it is trying to resolve problems that actually matter. 
"They don't release the bug fixes unfortunately. The guy at service said that was the issue. You can also tell because the number at the end of the software release changed. I got 2018.24.8 but the original release was 24.1 and then 24.7.  

This site shows how their members are on various versions:
https://teslafi.com/firmware/"
"Yeah but people overbrake all the time...alot of people's instinct is to follow too closely and then immediately slam the brakes when anything irregular occurs because they aren't paying attention. Rather than paying attention, leaving space in front of you, and then if a slow down occurs let off the accelerator rather than immediately hitting the brakes..."
"Agreed...But also, I don't expect people to get over if I'm trying to go faster than 75in the left lane. However, if I'm going 75mph and someone is clearly trying to pass me, I'll get over as soon as it's clear. It's just not worth it to slow down or brake check people, don't give them the satisfaction of ruining your drive because they want to drive faster than you...just get out the way and let em do their thing..."
Because if everyone else in front of me is going 80 and you're still tailgating me I'm not moving over. I refuse to. I'm not enabling bad behavior. Oh you want to pass me just so you can go the same speed the guy in front of you is? No thanks. I'll save the wear and tear on my tires and just keep going forward. 
"Make, model?
"
"I guess I can't be 100% sure.  
this is the closest thing I could find:  
https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/side-collision-avoidance.121320/
the post references the model 3 manual.   

Maybe it is a hardware 2.0 only thing?

I haven't experienced it myself and I'm not going to go try to trigger it on purpose  :)
"
Are you saying it actually swerved you away from a non threatening object and actually almost into another car?
People don't respond to a high beam flash in the US?
"I used to honk or flash my high beams to let them know they are impeding traffic, but most people here do not respond politely (middle finger, slow down, get next to a car in the right lane and match pace to really block any chance of passing, etc.).

Pretty much nothing on the road can match the Tesla's acceleration, and I use that to my advantage. I will hang back until there is room on the right. If they do not move over, I will blast around them quicker than they can react and be on my merry way. The Tesla's collision warning often gives me a congratulatory ""woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!"""
"Could be. I have 113k miles on mine, mostly electric! "
"No, this is wrong.  The lanes will display when lane change is available.  FAKE NEWS!  Lol.  Cars will always display but lanes won’t unless it will allow lane change.  Hope this makes it clear.  "
it needs to display two lane markers on a single side.  one next to your car and one farther over on the far side of the same lane.  won't auto change without both markings on the GUI.  also needs to be turned on in the settings before they will ever show up.  doesn't work for for me at all on non-highway roads.
"Thanks!  
I'm going to get mine ""serviced"" ( front license plate)  
And I was going to ask for the update"
"Sure, tailgating and lack of planning is part of it too but that doesn't remove the prior point "
"Nice pivot, people in front of you was not the point of your comment."
"2014 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite

Honda calls it the Blind Spot Information System. Two radar units mounted in the rear corners."
"I find it telling that the video describes it as warning and not avoidance.  Also, while you personally might not want to trigger it on purpose, where's a demo video of it from Tesla?  If Boston Dynamics can kick the shit out of BigDog, you'd think Tesla could do something similar."
"I have to *assume* that it wouldn't have gotten me dangerously close to the other vehicle and instead just trying to center me between the Scary-Cone and the Actual-Truck, but yeah, that's basically what happened."
Sometimes they brake check you 🙄
"That's what I do, but I usually get the 'WTF are you doing' look from that driver. Sigh.... "
"It's hit and miss.

Maybe like 30% of the time? 

50% if there isn't a car in the right lane for miles, then it's pretty obvious.

But otherwise they'll just speed up ever so slightly, but still take ages to actually pass anyone. It's aggravating."
From my experience most people don't even seem to know what that means
"In my experience, no. That's hardly ever worked. "
"Part of this may depend on age of driver. And region. If the highway/area is congested then no lane is the classic passing lane of days of yore. :)

And I don’t know if this is taught as a thing recently. I’ve been driving for decades and have never heard of honking for left lane hoggers. It was always flashing. So much for the classic shared experience. "
I've never even seen someone hi-beam flash while overtaking on a freeway in the US. It's not really taught or done here so I wouldn't expect someone to know what to do in response to one. 
Wait... there's a 'woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!'??
"Dude.  I drive this car every damn day.  I'm telling you, I get the blue lane lines and on this one particular stretch of highway for about 20 miles the damned auto-lane-change just refuses to work.

It's dumb because I have to cancel auto-pilot, change lanes, then re-enable auto-pilot. Since I am a courteous driver, so I stick to the outside lane and only use the inside lane for passing.  I either have to repeat that process every time I want to change lanes, or I just don't use auto-pilot on that stretch of highway."
Usually works. My charge cable died and they upgraded my firmware upon request when I stopped by to swap it out a couple days ago. 
Sorry I should have originally stated that. If people are going 80 in front of me and I'm going the same speed... I'm not moving over. 
Be careful these are less effective than Tesla's ultrasonics because the rated range is only 3-4 meters depending on the direction.
I see this all the time and have been driving for less than a decade. What part of the country?
"Well, it beeps at me when I get close to car in front of me during such maneuvers. I interpret it as an excited cheer instead of ""OMG! You almost hit that car! Let me out!"""
"You're looking at the wrong thing. If auto lane change is available there will be GREY lines showing the outside of the adjacent lanes. The blue lines show the lines of the lane you are in if autosteer is enagaged.  
  
Here is an example of the grey lines: https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2016/07/tesla-autopilot-5.jpg
  
In this case auto lane change is available in both the left and right adjacent lanes."
If yours does not change when lanes are displayed then you need to take it to service.  
"Ok, and if there is an empty lane to the right of you I guess I will have to use that...

The left lane is not for cruising, just because the person in front of you is doing it doesn't mean you should."
"They work just fine. Tesla can't do basic blindspot monitoring. In fact, it's annoying how reliable the Odyssey's blind spot monitor is, because it'll beep at me when I put my turn signal on and a car's there, even if it's perfectly obvious to me that a car is there. I've never seen it give a false negative, even deliberately trying to screw it up.

It's a crap shoot whether the Tesla will pick up on a car in the next lane. I never use automated lane changing while on Autopilot, because it's terrible at gauging distances to vehicles in the next lane."
"I'm on the west coast. I've seen people flashing their hi-beams to tell people to turn on their headlights or to signal to someone that they're yielding, but never for passing someone. "
"Yeah, I've been driving for 20 years, first in the midwest and now on the west coast, and I don't think I've ever seen or heard of that happening.  Flashing your high beams means ""your lights are off you idiot"" or ""slow down because there's a cop ahead."""
Hahaha fair. I was imagining something like this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6mh45mA\_JY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6mh45mA_JY)
"It does, usually, just not on this particular stretch of highway.  It's odd because it's actually freshly paved and freshly striped.

* Also, it's not really worth it to me to take it to service because service is on the other side of town and it's a 45 minute drive - 1.5 hour drive if it is anywhere near rush-hour, which it probably would be since the service center is only open 9-6.  I'll deal with it if I have another issue that I need to take it in for.

Which brings me back to my original ask - AP should indicate on the display if auto-lane-change is available."
"80mph is not cruising. And again, I'm not going to support terrible driving. If you crash because you wanted to go 90 mph in front of me you're going to ruin my day and cause me to be late. So no, you go around me if it's that important to speed. "
"Yep same with out CR-V, the blindspots detection is fantastic"
"San Diego checking in...I flash my beams to signal someone that:

A) Their headlights are off

B) It's ok for then to come into my lane (if they have signaled or I can tell they are thinking about doing it)

C) I'm trying to pass in the fast lane and they are going under 75mph. (If you're doing 75mph or more I don't think you should have to get over for anyone beside emergency vehicles.

Edit: formatting"
"But that's only if someone is travelling the opposite direction. If someone behind you flashes their brights, it means, please move over I'm trying to go a bit faster than you..."
"In the Northeast (and many other parts) it also has the 3rd meaning of ""Go ahead, I'm yielding to you"" - most often seen at an intersection with stop signs.

But yes, I'm also aware that flashing lights to get out of the left lane is a thing, though it certainly wasn't taught. When you think about it it just makes sense that some people are going to want to signal people to get out of the left lane, and the flashing lights is basically the only other signal (other than a honk) that cars can make. So it makes sense."
"Ah, I've seen it in Texas, which might explain some of the disparity in our experience. Flashing also has the meanings that you describe; in general, I just think of it as ""hey, I'm trying to get your attention for some purpose or another, look at the context to determine which meaning I'm going for."" (i.e. check that your lights are on, check the speed limit, etc.)"
It should totally do that on a ludicrous mode launch!
"Starting to feel like a broken record, it clearly shows it is available.  If you are having an issue it is with your individual vehicle. "
I second what is said above. AP clearly shows when it sees a lane it can change into by light gray lines to the left/right of the blue lines you mentioned.
"Ahhh, your the citizen police officer who is going to enforce the speed limit for everyone else.

In this situation cruising is maintaining speed in a current lane with the intention of staying in the lane, I don't care if you are going 55mph or 90.

Do you know what's more likely to cause an accident? The traffic you have caused to back up behind you. There is always going to be some one willing to go faster than you. The safest thing to do is to let them by.

"
"Why do you get to choose the speed? If you're impeding traffic, you're impeding traffic. Get the hell out of the fast lane."
"The suggested signal to get people out of the left lane is the left turn signal, but in practice nobody actually does that and a honk is probably the only thing that would be effective."
"No, I really don't care about the person behind me if I'm going over the speed limit. I just don't. It's YOUR job as someone who is behind me to make your decision to drive safely. I refuse to accept that I have an obligation to move over when I'm following someone in the left most lane going over 80mph an hour. Call me a citizen cop all you want. I'm staunch on this. "
"I agree, I always get out of the way if someone is going faster (as long as it is safe for me to do so). I'm only saying that I don't get annoyed with people going slower in front of me in the fast lane if they are at least doing 75mph, that's a reasonable speed over the general 65moh limit. Should they still get over? Yeah? But I understand if they don't feel they want to at that speed."
"In a lot of states its actually against the law.

In fact the Virginia Supreme Court has ruled that if you fail to yield to faster traffic you can be held responsible for subsequent accidents even if you are speeding.

So be as staunch as you want, you're still wrong.

Edit: Note in Virginia the faster traffic needs to signal by honking their horn or flashing their lights.  "
http://www.mit.edu/~jfc/right.html
"Oh ok I misread, sorry"
"I'm in California, so that doesn't apply to me, this applies to me:

Notwithstanding the prima facie speed limits, any vehicle proceeding upon a highway at a speed less than the normal speed of traffic moving in the same direction at such time shall be driven in the right-hand lane for traffic or as close as practicable to the right-hand edge or curb, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction or when preparing for a left turn at an intersection or into a private road or driveway.

If I'm flowing at the same speed as traffic in front of me, no one has any right to tell me to move over. And I'm not going to. "
I'm in California. The law basically backs up my claim that I don't have to move over because I'm flowing at the same speed as traffic in front of me. You just proved my point. 
"No worries, I was more clear in a different comment about being the person that will get over when I can, but I understand where you're coming from. It's annoying when people won't get over, especially when they're going at or barely above the limit..."
"I love how you inserted the traffic in front of you into the law...

If people are passing you, you are ""proceeding upon a highway at a speed less than the normal speed of traffic moving in the same direction""

Nice try though "
I bet you get pissed off and try to block out those people who wait till the last moment to merge too.
"No one is passing me, that's the point."
Somewhere there's a Tesla tech looking for their socket wrench.
Any chance that's a 10mm?
AKA: The most expensive wrench I’ve ever purchased
Thats your day 1 reservation gift.  They ran out of the diecast model.
"You’re supposed to smuggle parts *out* in your big lunch box (like nuts and bolts and all four shocks) not smuggle parts *into* the car. 

"
You get double points if the socket is 10mm.
Elon’s wrench! 
"Reminds me of the story my Dad tells about his 1975 Fiat 131 which he bought new from the dealer.  He heard a rattle coming out of the back, brought it to a body shop, and they found a ball peen hammer between the panel and frame.  I use that hammer to this day with metal work."
My grandpa said he practically assembled a new toolbox for free over his career... as an aircraft mechanic. 
"Tomorrow's headline on Seeking Alpha:

> Scrap! Scrap!
> Tesla is now scrapping their tools!
> Tesla is doomed!

/s"
That’s about $400 right there. I’m exaggerating of course but snap on is on the expensive side. Mechanics swear by it though. 
aaaand another lost 10mm
I bet a human left it there.
I’m so lucky!
And poor Jeff is like.. I swear i had it Yesterday! 
So *that's* where my 10mm went.
Elon’s magic wand!
Better check all the bolts in your car 
"Please bring it back to the shop.
That tech would be really thankful he doesn't have to buy another one."
"If that's 10mm, someone's going to go nuts "
Damn that wrench came in a fancy bit of packaging 😂 Make sure you recycle the packaging.
"So funny story, I ALSO found one of these in my model 3. Mine even had a little orange piece of tape wrapped around the middle of it for ease of sight I believe."
At least it's not a dildo 
[deleted]
Fuck..I think you're the first person ever to find the 10mm
You know that caused a 5 minute delay on the next car on the line because they couldn't find the 10mm
The handle is crazy short. Makes sense if it’s being used in a small space. I’ve never seen a non-standard one before.
"Thats pretty funny.
"
"Only tool I ever found after service was a long (24 inch?) Metal rod with 2 joints in it and a strong magnet on the end.

Great for picking up small dropped parts that I would never reach any other way."
*that’s what that rattle was...*
Tell Elon you'd like to hand deliver this back to the tech at the Giga.  Free tour!
Looks like someone is missing the keys to Falcon 9.
"Funny, but meh, I feel like I've found tools in the last few of my new cars as well.

Infiniti -- screwdriver; 
Genesis -- no tools, but did find ""extra"" bolts hanging out behind the headliner; 
Mazda -- some sort of wrench also under a floor mat"
Careful. Elon will see this and send and autonomous model 3 to come pick it up. 
"I would post this on Twitter, tag Elon Musk - Ask him if they want it back - Possible swag bag or something in return?"
I had a Kia that came with a screwdriver once. Must have been a long ride from Korea. 
"Remember the ""special something"" that was hinted at for reservation holders?

There you go...

;)"
"If this post gains enough traction, Elon Musk may ask for it back."
"It’s a feature, not a bug!"
"Honestly this disturbs me. If a intern can leave a tool under the floormat while building the car and no one even catches it before QC, i wonder what other serious fuck ups can happen. "
If the switch was set to “righty tighty” you’re all good!
Perhaps they put it down whilst they went for a break and didn’t finish bolting your seat in...😬
At least it's something extra vs something missing from your car lol.
Twist: that belongs to Elon
That QC is amazing at Tesla. 
"Snap-On, no wonder Tesla can't make a profit."
"That's actually a really nice ratchet.  I know I would love to have that back if I misplaced or dropped it.  Not only that, but returning it might get you a nice tour of the shop."
"Please try to return that, techs don't get paid well and that's a 75 dollar ratchet"
Will You return it? 😄
Noice.
Is it etched?
Damnit. This hurts. I lost my Powerbuilt wrench a couple days ago. Back to ACE ProSeries it is.

"I found a 12mm snap on ratchet spanner in my truck once.

Not a bad value adder tbh. Kinda wish it was a 10mm though."
Is that the performance version of the wrench?
"Ask musk on twitter if he wants it returned, maybe he'll send you a whole set from the factory :D"
I used to have a VW GLI and after taking it in for an oil change I popped the hood and found a nifty little tool someone had made out of a pair of long needle nose pliers. They had modified the tip to be at a 45 degree angle. I felt bad not giving it back but I'd be a liar if I said I never used it. 
"I honestly couldn't tell if this was actually a wrench, or if it was a pipe made to look like a wrench. "
WOW  That is worth it's weight in um well a socket wrench. 
Dude take it back to the shop. Those damn things are expensive. You'll make a friend for life.
I see you purchased the gear head premium package
Thats a good tool
Does it have the autotightening feature? 
That's one high tech assembly line robot.
Is that an 11mm?
"My Snap-On ¼"" ratchet is my favorite. That tech is surely missing this."
I wonder what your car needed rework for. They don't use hand ratchets on-line.

"That’s a genuine Tesla/Boring Co. socket wrench, valued at $2,999 to add to the cap and flamethrower collection. 1 of 1 too. "
You should return it. That's like $100+ of tool right there.
It's so when it starts to fall apart you have the correct tool to fix it with. It's a new feature.
I'll trade you for a long blonde hair I found in the tail light assembly of my model 3. 
Probably that due that tried to sabotage production by throwing a wrench into the Model 3 production line.

Well... "
tesla’s attention to detail is one reason im in a big rush to buy their vehicles
Pretty sure Elon just fired a bunch of people because of this. 
Tesla starts including free 10mm sockets with all purchases in a desperate attempt to win over mechanics. TSLA stock plummets. 
"And? These are included with all Model 3s. Part of the new ""fix it yourself"" feature. This is what you get when Tesla doesn't bother to quality test their cars. ^/s"
So return it. You know where it came from! Don’t be a fucking thief!
"Sears, that’s actually a little disappointing. "
That’s there to help disassemble the thing from the inside when the battery ignites and there’s no power to open the doors.
Their 10mm*
Snap On no less...
Sure is
"In case anyone doesn’t get the joke: 10mm are the most used, and therefore the most lost, and therefore most precious of all sockets. If you find one away from home, take a pic and put it on a car sub. "
all hail the mythical 10mm!
Came here to ask this question
Hooray for metric
This guy wrenches
[You could always go with these.](https://www.amazon.com/10mm-Socket-Pack-Drive-Shallow/dp/B077FFK3XB)  A good chance you will lose them before they break.

Up there with Occam's Razor and Schroedinger's Cat.
It very likely came from the tent...
My dad was a body shop guy. The story he heard in school was somebody got tired of hearing a rattle and took it to shop after shop. The finally found a glass bottle that was tied up inside one of the body panels with a note “how long did it take to find me?”
"Similarly I have a customer that is responsible for clearing debris off the runways at our local airport, and he claims to have completed an entire socket set from it."
"As an aircraft mechanic myself, that wrench with the 1/4"" socket is one of the most precious tools I have, along with the ratchet SnapOn screwdriver."

Sweet irony!
Everything is a dildo if you're brave enough. Including that wrench.
Dun Dun!
Oldest trick in the book and I fell for it
"Snap-on is a crazy good brand. If you’re not going to use it, I would suggest trying to reach out to Tesla to get it back to the mechanic. I’m sure they would do something really nice for you just for trying. Tools are often coveted and have some sentimental value to professionals in that field.  

I know a few weeks ago they had an all-hands-on-deck sort of deal going on where even Elon was out in the factory torquing wheels and such. I bet someone was rushing to get your car ready and forgot it. "
I’m work on aircraft for a living and a 1/4 inch ratchet would be my most used tool I reckon. Perfect for tight spaces!
"Doubt it. Can you imagine the headlines from the reporters who love to shit on Tesla?

""TESLA SO POOR AND ON VERGE OF COLLAPSE, CEO ELON MUSK ASKS CUSTOMER FOR $100 WRENCH BACK"""
"This probably didn’t happen at the factory...  they were in all likely hood tightening something at the service center, and it got left behind..  there was a straight razor left on my dashboard, at the SC...  they were fixing something that got caught in QC, and left behind a tool. 

They vacuum the cars at the service center, before delivery...

This happens as well in other cars, but they sit in a lot and get test drove many times, prior to delivery, and someone at the dealership spots it during a test drive...  But for Mo3..  the first time anyone looks at it other than the delivery center employee is the owner."
Enough people have mentioned how expensive it is that I’m going to take it back to the SC.
I wonder how fast it recharges?
"Those are great for hose clamps.  I have some, and I love them.   Truthfully, you should feel a little bad about not returning them.  But we all make mistakes."
Right. Maybe read the many replies about me returning it before you post that?
"Fuck, not the 10mm!!!!"

"why would they look, they know it's gone forever"
/r/justrolledintotheshop would love to hear about it
It would be genuinely surprising if it was anything else.

Thanks I was wondering... Also can confirm I have had a couple of cars that could be taken apart with a 10mm
M6 bolt boizz
10s and 13mms are the ones.i misplace the most
It is
Can you show me where the snap-on man touched you? \*points at wallet\*
Had to cut costs somewhere. Craftsman wrenches don't just come out of the ground.
[Sure is.](https://imgur.com/ypvUXJO)
And it didn't cost me a dime!
It’s a running joke amongst mechanics because it’s always the most common used/lost socket. 
The fact that its a 10mm makes this absolutely hilarious. Gotta tweet that and tag Tesla...
"It's a running joke that it's always the missing size. Presumably it's a common size to need, so common size to lose as well as to miss."

Been following that one for years. Not a 10mm socket to be found anywhere.

"I found my mechanic's awl stashed under the hood, just below the wipers - in that spot we all put a tool to grab later, then forget about. It's a Snap-On, too. Wonder what it goes for on the open market?"
"[This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/403/nummi) had a show about the war between UAW and GM at the NUMMI plant before Tesla bought it. Line workers put bottles and trash in the doors to rattle and cause a service visit. In addition to sabotage, there was also drinking, gambling, and sex on the assembly line."
"> Tesla can’t explain why they are loosing 5,000 10mm sockets a week"
They're not wrong.

"I live close to a service center. Next time I’m there I’ll drop it off. Maybe they can return it, and if not, it can stay in the Tesla family."
So you’re saying Elon put it in the car himself!
Great idea. I know if my Snap-on ratchet ‘grew legs’ I’d sure love to get it back.
Speed handle for me.
"The big thing isn't so much the price, but most mechanics actually use their own tools.  The shop only owns the specialized tools and very limited other things.  Day to day tools like ratchets, wrenches, screwdrivers, sockets, etc. belong to the technicians.  It *really* eats into their wages, to the point that unless they already have an extensive collection, their first month or more working as a mechanic can actually be at a loss to them financially.

The ratchet is between $45 and 55.  Beyond the money, it will really make the guy's day that he got it back.

I would still ask for a tour, though.  The worst they can say is that they aren't allowed to do it."
"Please don’t return it to the service center.

Tesla’s assemblers do not purchase their own tools, they are provided by the company.

You may think that you’re doing good by returning it but in reality they will figure out who’s it was and who missed spotting it and they will face consequences.

The assembler and the guys working in quality that inspect the vehicles for FOD and defects will thank you for keeping this to yourself.

Please keep it and think of it as a bonus for purchasing and awesome car.

"
my old 96' Jetta 2.0 probably could have been taken apart with a single 10mm...come to think of it...I think I lost one when I sold that thing - I bet it was in the passenger door pocket where I kept it for emergencies.
It’s always the 10mm
"in greece we affectionatelly call them ""δεκαράκι""/""thekaraky"" as in ""the small 'ten'"".

it's also common to have too many of them to the point where you reach behind the sofa and come back with a couple tennies."
Found the 10 mil
Not if you don't realize you left it there.
justrolledoutoftheshop
They also aren't very Tesla friendly over there. 
"> /r/justrolledintotheshop

oh man, I totally thought that's where I was for a second. "
/r/justrolledintotheshop might also be interested to know about [becoming a Tesla technician ](https://electrek.co/2018/03/26/tesla-start-automotive-training-program/)  — they guarantee their trainees a job.
But for that to be so easy it would have to be easy for someone to actually maintain ownership of a 10mm socket to take said photos with in the first place. And we all know that's impossible.
"A risky move, let’s see how it works for him, Cotton. "
For some more advanced karma make a video of a socket wrench over brodyquest
Oh wow I found this 10mm in my piña colada in the Bahamas! The vacation paid for itself!
"Wow, how does one go about being a Professional professional?"
you got that ratchet and socket for a deal if all you had to do was purchase a Model 3 for it! I don't like to think about how much I've spent on tools.
Now you have to add $75 to your monthly payments for the next 3 years to pay for that Snap On accessory.
"Was a mechanic in college, can verify (but couldn’t afford those expensive mofos. Hello Craftsman)."
"No joke that ratchet is probably worth $75, tech *might* buy you a beer for bringing it back lol."
You'll know it's me when I roll through your town 
"One year, my wife bought me 5 10mm 3/8 sockets for Christmas. I think I have one, maybe 2 left. "
So the equivalent of a Phillips screwdriver for nerds!
That’s pretty funny
It's also the most common bolt in cars. Most of the ground bolts and the fixing bolts are all 10mm heads. 
"Hmm, I definitely replied to the wrong person there."
Ticket for *two*.
"We could trade? Wives or tickets, don't matter to me."
Same here. 
"Seems like you know whose it is, so you could be a decent human being and give it back.  Just saying."
"Yeah, but it's different because it is a 10mm."
"When you have a shop full of mechanics,  it's like book day in school."
Much appreciated. I’ll give you a sweet jailhouse tattoo when I get out.
I’d tweet Elon that you have it first.
"It’s possible haha. I read somewhere on this subreddit a few weeks ago a story from a guy that works as an engineer or something along those lines. He said they were all called in super early to help on the assembly line and as he was working he was a bit awestruck to see Elon a little ways down working. 

Elon didn’t think much of it, but a CEO helping on the frontline of any company says a lot imo. "
Yeah true! That’d be another high use one. Although lately we have started using drills more. The amount of time you save is crazy. 
Not sure about US but in AUS that small 3/8 ratchet is about $160AUD. 10/10 a unhappy mechanic is turning everything upside down and inside out trying to find it.
"I had a Tesla Ranger tell me (in Canada, anyway) Tesla supplies all the tools for them. He literally has thousands of dollars worth of tools sitting at home collecting dust.

Best job he's ever had, he said. Side note: the Tesla Model S Ranger setup is badass!"
That's a Snap-On. It's easily in the range of 8-10 times that much.  Best quality of any tool made in the world. Lifetime no-nonsense warranty.
Why would you try to hide fod/quality defects? 
What if it was one of the service center or delivery center technician's tools? Could have been left in the car as part of the PDI process or something.

don't forget the 13 too!
“Missing tools critical to Model 3 production cause serious delays.”
"I believe the joke is 10mm are notorious for going missing so they often have to be replaced, so the guys joke is that the mechanic/manufacture already assumes he’s not gonna find it"
10mm lost/found and on a Tesla....They will have a field day!
"Well that actually makes sense considering that ICE cars require major maintenance on the CE, and they are mechanics in that sub.

Are there any real numbers out yet on how much lower EV maintenance costs are in the long run?"
That's awesome!
I’ve heard tell that there are only 25 10mm sockets in existence at any one time. 
Post a picture to /r/rolledintotheshop and we'll meet again tomorrow on the front page.

That his processes are out of control if your chief executive is putting the card together? I get the sentiment / moral boost but surely a CEOs role is anything but vehicle assembly? Hence you getting bonus parts in your vehicle.....
"Yeah, that ratchet is easily $80-100 USD. 

I've spent lots of time searching for lost tools worth less. The frusterating part isn't always the cost (although that sucks too), but the time wasted especially if it's a tool you use often. "
"I have a 1/4 drive Snap-On.  A la carte, it was about $75.  I am told they can be a lot less if bought from the vendor rep who visits the shop, depending on how much the shop people buy."

I have a 74 beetle. I think the entire thing can be taken apart with like 3 tools.
The reason they’ve been struggling to keep up with demand is that they’ve all been secretly sharing that one 10mm socket...
"And also that 10 mils are so common in working on a lot of cars, that it's no surprise they lost one and they probably have a bunch of extras."
"They'd somehow come up with it being ""made in a tent without any type of HVAC open and exposed to the environment"". Then some tirade about how the company will be bankrupt in 2 years.."
">They also aren't very Tesla friendly over there.

It definitely makes sense why they would be, it is a challenge to their livelihood.

  That would be cool to see, they don't really use the brakes since regenerative braking. There is no oil changes like with ICE. I could see some of the other systems (AC etc) eventually failing but without them being tied to an angry hot gas motor and being more or less enclosed they must have a much better lifespan."

however, there is still value in doing what he did:

a) morale boost

b) getting hands-on insight to figure out where bottlenecks etc. are

c) mixing up your 16h workday so that you don't always do the same

Of course if you don't have to lead anymore for the time being, then working instead of relaxing is also a good sign towards your subordinatws, but I highly doubt that there wasn't something to do..."
"yeah, I once lost a Milwaukee 3/8 rattle gun in a customers car once because we didn't have the globe in stock and thought he was going to wait but he didn't want to and drove off. Called him and all that, but he didn't come back for 2 weeks. Never left a tool in the boot of a car again haha. Lost a few sockets here and there but always double/triple check."
"Really, I didn't know they were that cheap.

I wasn't aware that they listed their prices on the website... that one might be a stubby 3/8 drive.  Looks like this one to me:  https://store.snapon.com/Dual-80-174-Technology-Compact-Head-3-8--3-8-Drive-Dual-80-Technology-Compact-Head-Ratchet-P648782.aspx  which lists for $92.

The 10mm sockets list for about $22 each."
"Weird, my OEM tool kit came with a wrench that was 10mm on one end and 13mm on the other, IIRC. That was for the Corrado though. The Golf just came with sadness and disrepair. "
"Eh, maybe more misunderstood. I think it's hilarious that we are all celebrating getting a free tool with a car that costs as much as a house. Myself included. In 2018 it's perceived harder to get your hands onto a small specialized tool than a crazy expensive car. Funny, no? Just me? Meh"
I had no idea there were so many running jokes about tools!
So what happens if a tool is lost like in this case? Is that Tech or Tesla stuck paying for a tool they don't have anymore? 
"I get your points and as an outsider to vehicle manufacture they’re all well meaning 

BUT for a standard output (quality cars with no bonus tools being delivered in them) you need a standard input

From material delivery, working processes, (enough) competent staff to build the cars etc.

And as we’re seeing one of the above (if not all) are missing which means the quality of the vehicles will suffer and the next wave of posts will be poor TM3 customer feedback 

A bonus tool in a car is a huge red flag that processes are not in control 

I’ll also bet £100 that tool is from a repair process, any torquing in mainline assembly is done on either DC tools (to kick back when toque is met and recorded where safety critical (body : chassis marriage, wheel nuts etc)) or done with much large tools, so that will have been placed there after doing something additional to the mainline and a repair head has left it there 

Really poor from a mass market manufacturer "
"Looks like it.  I bought mine because I was working in tight places where more basic ratchets couldn't get enough swing for the mechanism to work.

As for the sockets, the only ones I bother with from Snap-On are the high quality thin-walled sockets and the tapered socket that works well on semi-rounded bolts.  I'm not a mechanic by trade, so I don't go dump $350 on a ratchet and a dozen sockets easily."
"You missed the joke. It's not a specialized tool, its just a normal socket and ratchet. The brand (snap on) cost more than a house to buy a set of tools, people literally have mortgages for their tool sets."

You never been outside? All the joggers are laughing at you! #weak
"That tech. I can't imagine Tesla is supplying tools to their guys, especially not snap on"
You and me both!  I have some old Craftsman sockets from before they were offshored to China.  They are fine for non-pro use.
