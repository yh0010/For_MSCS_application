"This was always Elon Musk's strategy - to build the most desirable vehicles irrespective of their ""green"" benefit. And it's likely the reason that they've actually succeeded, unlike so many others."
"Whenever I list the benefits of EVs I always leave out environmental benefits. 

1. People will argue  whether or not they are better for the environment. Better to just leave it alone

2. Most people don't buy cars for the environment. They might buy a higher mpg car for their own bottom line. "
"If you have 45 minutes, check out [power4patriots](https://secure.power4patriots.com/index.php)

It's like they went so far to the left that they came out the other side.  It's promoting solar to give the finger to big government and regulation.  Tesla could take this even further with the solar roofs and home batteries."
"Trump Picks Top Climate Skeptic to Lead EPA Transition   :(

Elon is making America great again and he should be capitalizing on that.
"This is precisely the reason I purchased a Tesla.  Helping the environment is nice.  

My son not dying in the sands of Syria over oil is a hell of a lot nicer.  Which is why we need economically-sustainable renewables.

Glad to see Elon pushing for Tesla to join with a renewable company.

"I've been saying this for years.  It actually catches them off-guard a bit, which is good.

""100% of the money I spent in 'fuel' last year, stayed in America - it pays for maintenance crews in my town that maintain the lines, and folks that work at the plant an hour away that generate the power.  Not only am I supporting America, I'm supporting my local neighbors.  I prefer if my money doesn't leave our borders.

Half [or whatever the appropriate %age is now] of your money spent on fuel last year, went to the Middle East. So why again is your car better than mine?"""
"You make a good point and this has always been good marketing for Tesla. 

Many Tesla drivers, myself included, are interested in green causes but not especially passionate about them. I like that the car is green, but more than that I like the performance and technology. I can't explain it, but even excellent ICE engines seem somehow old-fashioned in my mind, now. That's not to say that they aren't superior in a number of ways, that I'll never drive one, that I think they suck, etc. It's just a mindset of, ""This is the future. That was the past."" 

I don't think I'm alone in that, and I think it would be a good way to focus Tesla's marketing efforts, if they had any."
Let em now that those Arabs and Muslims in the middle east don't make any money when you buy a Tesla and you've got a winning message that tugs at the heart strings for the right :D
"Counter Point: The Republicans in congress won't care that Teslas are made in America, because the factories are located in California and Nevada."
"Silly wabbit. Coal/Oil is American, EV's are not.. Perhaps you did not pick up the dog whistle from their main campaign slogan yet. They don't mean by America, what you mean by America."
I'd get a Tesla if I wasn't poor.
"Literally everyone here has a responsibility to push the new ""Before the Flood""  movie with Leonardo Dicaprio on NatGeo.  What a terrifying piece of film.   In it,  Elon says only 100 of his gigafactories could change everything.  Please push this on your friends and family.  "
"Your argument is based on the assumption that all or most car buyers are rational beings. I think it is safe to say the election more or less proved that people, in general, are not. They'll believe the story that most appeals to them. Facts are irrelevant.

Sad, but there you go."
"I don't think you have to believe in climate change to appreciate the other benefits that renewable energy brings. This is from a couple years ago, but Bill O'Reilly seems to agree:

http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-oreilly-lavishes-tesla-with-praise-one-year-after-blasting-it-2014-4"
"How much do electric vehicles actually help the environment relative to gas cars anyway? At the risk of sounding uninformed, just because EV's don't leave emissions on the road doesn't mean that the energy used is 100% clean. Like it or not, there is still coal on the wires that charge your car, not to mention the disposal of the battery. "
"My understanding is that ever since fracking debuted and disrupted the world, the US is no longer dependent on foreign oil. "
Not only will it eliminate foreign oil dependency but also solve national and NATO security issues.  Oil will no longer fund global terrorism.
"I'd rather have foreign oil than American coal. Until we get serious about renewable energy sources I don't like the Tesla's powering. That's nice that it's being worked on. One day it could be pretty cool. But for now? No. The coal industry fucks miners over hard. 

But since I support the humans gathering coal and doing the work who still need to put food on the table, I support retraining initiatives for renewable energy programs for those workers. But again, we don't take it seriously as a country. "

A lot of my friends didn't know they are US made.
"I disagree. Yes, completely, Tesla should sell themselves as the best vehicles you can get, American, all that. 

But right now, the half of the country that cares about the environment feels completely impotent. If Tesla positions itself as the certain action that you CAN take to help the world (with a side of wild acceleration, self-driving, and near-silent luxury), there will be loads of takers. 

By the time they run out of customers who see environmental benefits as at least a nice bonus, EVs should be cheaper upfront than ICE vehicles, and it doesn't really matter. "
Also start considering how other countries will feel about buying American. I actually questioned myself this morning if I should cancel my Model X order! :O
"All the energy that goes into a Tesla driven in America was produced in America! *

\* or Canada"
"No. If you want to sell Teslas, you have to make a case that it will be better as a car for equal or less money. It's only people on the margins who buy cars as an act of do-gooding.  Most economic transactions happen for financial reasons. "
I like the passion but we need a cheap model first
Isn't Toyota made in the USA?
"This may be a dumb question, but I am asking it sincerely:

Electric cars have to be charged somehow. Doesn't that come from electricity that comes from burning coal?"
It's sad that this is how we have to sell it now.
great idea actually 
"But oil and coal industries are much bigger and employees more people.. how are you going to respond to that argument? 

And what about the lobby $$$$? Also I don't think they care about the oil dependency, to be honest."

Every Tesla sold is like a freedom nuke lobbed at North Korea!

"I'm confused about what you think has changed or why you think this is necessary.

Tesla's not relying on the USG to purchase its vehicles..."
Why not both (or all three)?
Seems like a massive marketing misstep not to. 
"There are a lot of people who want a Tesla for this reason, but when your car is $130k+ fully loaded (Model S), you're priced out of reach for most working class Americans. For those of us already driving luxury cars, the option was to get a stripped Tesla or a loaded 5-series or E-class (or even a base model Panamera). It's not about the environment or patriotism, it just comes down to raw pricing. I'm optimistic about the Model 3, and try to buy Made In USA goods when possible, so time will tell. "
Didn't they announce that they will no longer provide free charging for drivers? 
"Isn't Tesla the most American car? (Serious question, labor obviously, what about parts?) Who is next in line to be most American?"
I agree. This should be a priority.  Tesla needs to build a plant in Texas!
And make sure you make 90k+ per year to afford :)
Great. This is the right way to say it. All true. 
"If Trump is worth his grit, he should keep his word and support American companies like Tesla.  Doubt he will, though."
I live in a southern state and do some work for DoE. This is how I sell EVs and CNG vehicles to southern republicans.
I would love to buy a progressive US product. But damn those things are pricey. 
"Trump's views on green energy aside, I can definitely see he and Musk working out something together."
How about you make them cheaper and people will buy them 
"Elon is opening Gigafactory 2 in Europe to create the batteries and vehicles there instead.

"Tax credit or not, I'm still buying the Model 3!!"
Rumor has it that Elon is moving Tesla to Germany once SCTY is acquired. And SpaceX soon after. Trump can have the rest of the gas and oil car companies to help make america great again.
"I agree, just from personal experience, my parents ridicule people who get electric cars because they don't care about the environment, but they love american made shit."
"**TESLA:** in shining luminious silver

Chorus of robot voices sound like Elon Musk, Cortana, Siri and WOPR , Arnold's Terminator on a black screen: 

*Assimilation is not optional.* 

It's just an idea.

"
The republicans I know who have model 3 pre-orders made them for that reason AND they don't want to be dependent on other people for power production (They hope to go solar for charging). 
Not everyone has 90k lying around though 
The average person could care less about the environment
"Sooo, those cars can't even be built without foreign oil...

Just saying."
"Solar is a threat to ""clean"" coal and Midwest jobs. Tesla's EV direct sales model is a threat to existing US dealerships and associated jobs. Teslas heavy dependence on conspicous automation is a threat to autoworker jobs in addition to autopilot. Expect the new administration to do its best to put Tesla under and kill any innovations they are engaged in."
\#MakeNUMMIGreatAgain
"The average person swept up in the ""don't send my job overseas"" can't afford a Tesla so I don't think it's wise to attempt to appeal to those people. The average blue collar worker making $14/hr isn't going to buy an expensive car. They're gonna buy some used car for $10k or less and make payments on it. Tesla should stick to selling cars to people who buy BMW M3s and $10k Apple watches. I remember when Cadillac tried to appeal to low income people buy selling some shitty Catera sedan and it flopped big time."
Funny. These are the reasons i love tesla and invest in them. I also invest in scty for similar reasons. Environmental impact has never been something i have cared about with tesla or scty. 
Is this seriously what we've come to?  Moved half of my TSLA to BYD yesterday.
"I think he understands that most people see the green benefits as not as a big motivator. No if he has the money will abondon a Jaguar for a shitty french electric car that looks like a tuna can on wheels. He understands that electric car needs to be as cool as or even cool as any Aston or Ferarri. I think he has achieved this with Tesla, and even Model 3 is the best looking car for the 30-40K price range!"
But I am European!
So play on their stupidity then? Genuinely good idea... they should do it.
"Many of us already bought the car because it is a great car and we love technology. I didn't buy it to save the planet but if it helps do that I'm ok with that as well. 

I highly doubt many Tesla owners only bought it to save the planet. Plenty of cheaper ways to effect change than to buy a car. 

"
I hope that Tesla continues to do well with the upcoming changes in our gov't. If I had the money I would be buying Tesla...one day I will.
Not just oil independence but energy independence! This is also the reason for buying solar panels and Powerwalls.
"Thats how to market in coal country right there.  My car runs on electricity from the local mine, not oil from the middle east.  "
"I take your point, but this sub isn't just for Americans. Using terms like ""we"" to mean those in USA is pretty short-sighted, even if it does apply for Tesla as a company"

"Want to win a Tesla? We are raffling a tesla for our campaign to put a price on carbon in Massachusetts. Check out carbonraffle.org for more information!
"
They are too expensive for the vast majority of drivers.  I can get a decent vehicle for $3500 and it will last me 5+ years with basic maintenance.  I won't be in debt. 
not to naysay or whatever because teslas are sweet and I'm all for getting away from oil. But lithium mining is fucking awful.
"The Model S isn't quite as American as - for example - a Ford F-150 or Chevrolet Silverado - which to be fair, have a more macho and American image than the Tesla, and are considered as American cars. It's not a bad car, but it's not seen as very macho to people who own pick-ups, Corvettes, Cadillacs etc.

With the Ford or Chevrolet - you have a dealer network for when it needs maintenance, that's well-supported, but for Tesla, uncertain residual values, and no dealers - which will put some people off."
The push? Teslas sell themselves on multiple levels.
"Doesn't matter, trump's putting in a pipeline!!!"
"FYI, I personally know a lot of people who think global warming is happening but voted for Trump anyway. It's not like 50% of the country thinks that global warming isn't happening. According to recent polls only 26% of Republicans think Global Warming isn't occurring.

Also the reason why me and EVERYONE I know that love Tesla has absolutely nothing to do with global warming. I personally also believe global warming is occurring but fixing it isn't anywhere near the top of my priority list of problems that need solving. I still love Tesla and will be buying one however. They're not very correlated."
Ya tesla and solar city exist dye to government subsidies. 
"And what's even more interesting is that this great new mantra that you laid out doesn't sell to liberals whatsoever.  

Probably because they are stuffed with a bunch of leftist cuckolds who would rather give housing and jobs to imported Syrian refugees more than they want to give it to American veterans and the American homeless here.

...And just to clarify on your other point.  Trump himself doesn't believe climate change itself is a hoax, he just thinks the problems that come from it are lower on the priority scale than creating jobs, individual success, and terrorists hurting Americans.  And I would somewhat agree with that assessment.

I'll also guarantee you that Trump will be willing to do a DEAL where both sides can get what they want."
Because everyone can afford a 120k car.   
Too late.  Musk's liberal bias is going to bite him on the ass just like the rest of the liberal fucks in this nation.  He is not going to send jobs overseas now that Donald Trump is president so we don't have to worry about that.  Now that there is no liberal influence on American politics we can finally drill our own damn oil so nobody's worried about that either.  The performance of electric cars is shit so I don't have to address that point.  He should have bent the knee when he had the chance but instead he supported Hillary.
And they're Made In America!
"Coincidentally, it also exposes the interests of those who actively root against Tesla.  "
"It is important to market to those that don't care about the enviroment using their own interests and perspectives.

Tell them how solar gives the finger to big government and regulations. Invest and become the owner of your own energy.

How Tesla is creating a lot of high paying jobs for the American people. American engineering, made on America for Americans.

Forget about metioning stuff that usually attracts those already interested in Tesla, becuz you already got them. Try to get those that dislike Tesla by speaking to them on their own terms."
"Yes, but he mostly talks about the Need to end fossil fuel dependency and go green essentially."
"Exactly.  Honda and Toyota started the ball rolling with hybrids in the 2000's.  They were ugly, weak, and slow.  Their owners are routinely mocked.  If you remove the moral desire to go green, they are completely undesirable vehicles.  Elon was 100% correct, going green is not motivation enough."
"Yeah, I really don't see a reason why I shouldn't buy a Tesla, except maybe the initial expense being higher than other cars."
"I think they could benefit by having a ""mystic"" about the technology behind the vehicle. They need to amp up a message of how intensely high tech their product is. But they should only do this once they get their production up. No sense investing in ads to sell nothing. "
"Exactly. As long as it's cheaper to own an electric Tesla than a comparably price ICE A6, the Tesla will win out in the end. 

One thing I can foresee is Tesla pushing a few traditional solar panels and power wall that generate just enough power to juice up your car every night, versus power your whole home. "
"How do Americans think about air quality in general? Is there a controversy around that topic as well? Having to smell all those exhausts while cycling next to a big street in summer is quite annoying imo.

It's probably not an good argument while buying your own car, but at least paints a pretty picture about a future with lots of EVs, and why the government should probably incentivize them."
"Most people don't buy anything ""for the environment"". People in this forum may not understand that but they are in the minority with respect to purchasing decisions.

Elon was smart to have his #1 goal to make the best car, the fact that it is also helping save the planet is great, but it would be a failure if it wasn't a great car. "
"Totally. I used to work in Tesla sales, spoke to thousands of members of the public about Model S, and took ~100 test drives. I'd estimate the number of customers for whom the environment was a selling point was <10 (for S/X, 3 was a bit better for this). 

I'd usually tentatively mention environmental benefit near the beginning of a test drive to gauge the reaction, but mostly the reaction was ""I don't care, can we launch/use autopilot again?""

"
Legitimate question: what other benefits do you mention to people?
"I usually leave out the economics of it as well, because people will always point out how expensive they are.

For my selling points I go with the convenience of charging at home and always starting the day with ""a full tank"", not wasting time going to a gas station to fill up."
"Solar is not a partisan issue, a true free market republican citizen wants to be able to invest in their own energy. Where the issue goes south is when politicians are more corporatist than conservative.

Yeah, and the poo pooing of a particular American manufacturer because it doesn't align with your lobbyist, is total hypocrisy. All the love for the former big three who are moving jobs out the country by the bus load. Again, free market republicans in theory should love some TSLA. Then again, I am not sure what happened to ""regular"" republicans."
This article is over 6 weeks old. Who knows? He might've picked a crazier person by now.
"LOL @ Tesla fan/owner Trump supporters. What did you people think would happen?

We'll be lucky if they don't pass a bill banning solar power and electric vehicles."
"Which still could be prevented as that--and other executive cabinet positions--require senate approval. With 46 Dems and 2 independents caucusing, it may be possible to sway a few Republicans: John McCain, Utah Senators, Pat Toomey, Lindsey Graham, Lamar Alexander. If Democrats, Independents, and Republican voters can influence those listed to reject Trump's nominee, then it's possible to negate the worst possible outcome. "
"you can talk about the EPA, but under Obama - the EPA was pretty impotent. "
Grab em by the inverter.
MAKE AMERICAN MANUFACTURING GREAT AGAIN!
"Yet, despite reducing dependency on oil and being completely American made...a Trump Presidency is going to negatively impact everything Tesla/Solar City."
"Tesla, powered by AMERICAN SUNSHINE!"
300% zoom in order to read that.  I hate you.
"I noticed this while standing in line to reserve the M3. It is not the granola crowd, but the tech crowd, that occasionally eats granola."
"I get what you're saying, it seems like we've reached the point of diminishing returns when it comes to R&D for ICEs. "
"Honestly anyone that supports tesla and clean energy should start talking now about it like they didn't cared about the enviroment.

Start talking like the right, becuz the left is already with you. Don't sell it to enviromentalist but rather to those that don't care about it, using their own interests and perspectives. On their own terms."
"Yeah, the two current models cost more than my house.  The 3 still isn't affordable for me.  I drive a 20 year old jeep, my wife drives a Kia.  I'd love to own one, but until they're going for under $10k it's not a realistic car for me and many people I know.

So basically, you early adopters need to adopt faster and bring the price down for us poor folk :D"
"Well if it is so simple, why dont you guys do that?

Tell them the very thing that would appeal more to them about tesla. Truly 'Murican engineering, made on murica for muricans. Get your own solar roof to give the finger to big government and regulations, invest and be the owner of your own energy.

So on and so forth..."
"Kinda depends on what you include in the scope of the environment.  As you said, they don't make emissions on the road, they don't make any noise running a engine, and at no point are they going to be blue smoke generators (burning oil).  So if we scope the environment to the local, neighborhood scale, then it is a vast improvement:  quieter streets, cleaner air.  

Moving to a larger regional scale, they help some by allowing us to locate power plants away from the population centers into areas that can better soak up the pollutants, or be designated wasteland space.  However, it is much easier and cheaper to replace a aging power plant than a million cars with high mileage engines.  So any upgrades/replacements that reduces pollution will be spread instantly through the fleet.  The efficiency of the power plants themselves are much higher than engines.  

Disposal of the battery is all about economics at the moment.  Li-ion batteries are recyclable, and are valued as such.  Oddly though, it is not because of the Lithium, but some of the other metals that goes into it.  Lithium cost more to recycle than new.  The battery overall isn't great for the landfill, but doesn't look as near as damaging as older lead-acid batteries. 

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lithium-ion-batteries-hybrid-electric-vehicle-recycling/"
"It's complicated. It's a global market, so anything that happens to impact the global demand/supply impacts everywhere else. So if Iran begins ramping up production as they're in the early stages of doing, that will crater the price of oil globally assuming demand doesn't increase with the additional supply or supply isn't cut elsewhere. Or if there's a major recession in a major market like China or elsewhere that could depress demand and cause oil prices to fall unless there's production cuts (as it did in late 2008-2009)."
"Last time I checked most cars don't run on natural gas.

EDIT: To add to that, looks the the US is 3rd in the world in oil production with [9.2 million barrels per day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_production) and 1st in the world in oil consumption with [19.4 miliion barrels per day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_consumption).  Soooo.... about energy independence.  Where does the other 10 million barrels per day come from?"
"You can see the total sources of imported oil to the US here:
http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=727&t=6

The US has net imports of 4.71 million barrels per day of foreign oil, and 1.06 million barrels of oil a day are imported from Saudi Arabia. All fracking has done is to increase the domestic production of oil, but it has not eliminated oil imports -- not even close.

The OP is right. Driving an electric vehicle is a patriotic American thing to do. This is something we need to be shouting from the rooftops. "
We can be our-hemisphere dependent right now. 
"ALL ENERGY ALL THE TIME.  Solar wind oil gas everything.  No more regulations.

Let's unlock all that dark energy beneath us before it's all worthless.  That's why it's important to turn up the spigout and extract all the oil energy that we can, as soon as we can.

Because as Tesla owners, we know that the black goo won't be worth very much for the countries who are sitting on it for too long."
They're working on that.
"Dude, he ain't 'merican. He's from the country of Africa."
Good thing Trump is pro-legal immigrants then.

"> with a side of wild acceleration

The base Model 3 is going to accelerate about as fast as a (cheaper) V6 Honda Accord or a base C Class Mercedes: 5.5-6.0 seconds. The top of the line model will be something like $60-65k and have acceleration right in line with something like an M3 or AMG C63 ATS-V, all of which hit 60 in under 4 seconds.

>near-silent luxury

They've got the silent part down, but not the luxury, not compared to their competitors.

They need to double down on their environmentally-friendly angle, and hope the rest of the car catches up by the time the big automakers are competing with Tesla head-on, because a great brand image can only keep you afloat for so long. A couple of wrong moves and Tesla will be nothing but a battery and solar supplier in a decade, this sub tends to take it for granted otherwise."
"Screw that, we're doubling down. I pre-ordered a Model 3 on launch day, and just talked my wife into a lease before then.

If they're not going to regulate in our favor, then I feel even more duty-bound to support Tesla, and my vision of our future."
I used to shop on American sites as much as possible to save a few bucks... Not anymore. (Canadian)
You would cancel an order for the second best car in the world simply because of the country it's built in?
"This is true. However going how the pricing of batteries has been dropping like a stone, this can't be too far off now. (Ignoring Model 3 as that's still too expensive for many, maybe second hand it will cover a wider base, but this is some way off)."
Some Hondas are.
"It doesn't have to. Even if it does (say you're in a state that mostly uses coal), the efficiency is much greater doing it that way - burning stuff in one big efficient plant as opposed to lots of 20-30% efficient internal combustion engines. I can't remember off the top of my head, but electric cars including grid inefficiencies are something like over 90% efficient at turning the electricity sent their direction into motion. 

Even better, as the grid becomes greener, which it inevitably will as solar and wind get cheaper and become more competitive, an electric car just becomes more efficient, cheaper to run in terms of fueling costs (still need to get the price of them batteries down as purchase costs are still too high), and greener for those who worry about that kind of thing."
"Coal, natural gas, nuclear power, renewables, etc. There's a whole mix of energy that goes into charging an electric car.

"
"That depends on where you are it could be coal, natural gas, nuclear, solar, wind, or a combination of sources.  The more we get rooftop solar and battery back ups, the sooner we get rid of all of the fossil fuels."
And there have always been climate change skeptics. Do you think this election will cause more people to be skeptics?
"Federal auto manufacturer dealership restrictions and excessive ""corrective"" EV tax laws are likely to pass congress unchallenged.

"
"Vehicles purchased after a certain date (Jan 2017 I think) will be give 1,000 miles of free supercharger network usage per year.

Existing owners will continue to get theirs free forever.

Their new restrictions are very reasonable and very necessary for the Model 3 rollout."
"There are several automotive assembly plants in the US.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_automotive_assembly_plants_in_the_United_States
"
"Have you a source for that? Lithium isn't actually mined as such:

> As of 2015 most of the world's lithium production is in South America, where lithium-containing brine is extracted from underground pools and concentrated by solar evaporation. The standard extraction technique is to evaporate water from brine. Each batch takes from 18 to 24 months.

[From Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium#Production)

Watch out, there was a media hit piece put out there by oil and gas lobbyists using a fictional example. And totally ignoring their own environmental production issues. It was an example showing this lithium 'mine' (which was nothing of the sort) in virgin forest, at the start, and after it had devastated the surrounding area. That particular example has already been thoroughly debunked elsewhere, but still gets quoted, so I guess it's paid off well for whoever put it out there. Is lithium environmentally pure? Of course not, but I'd wager the alternative oil and gas route is actually much worse, and less sustainable as you can't recycle it once burnt, whereas lithium can be."

Then I follow it up with cost per mile. It cost me 4 cents per mile or less to fill up at home. And that doesn't change with oil prices, electricity stays fairly constant. Then I mention all the free chargering stations in the area, Maryland has a ton. Then they start doing the math in their head; gas is $/gallon divided by mpg.

Meanwhile, moving manufacturing back to the US:

That ""small staff"" is typically well paid technicians and engineers, as well as assembly line supervisors. Also these robots aren't maintence free, they require skilled labor to service and those are jobs that can't be outsourced. 

Even with high levels of automation US manufacturing will employ millions of people.

Teslas are way out of budget for most common folks at this point in time, especially as people in Europe don't tend to drive anywhere near as much as Americans.

How about no subsidies..... Let business succeed or fail in the market place.  That's call capitalism boys and girls.  
"I mean, I agree with the direction of Tesla. However, the other industries employee literally thousands more people than Tesla. Peoples' livelihoods hinge on the companies' abilities to stay afloat. In time let's hope that Tesla and companies like it grow to a larger market share and can bring more to the economy.

It's a hard thing to balance. "
"May Musk shuts them all.  Its a David vs Goliath type of fight.

You have 1 company (well 2) that are trying to do good for mankind VS  disgustingly rich corporations who want ~~to destroy~~ quo status  even if the consequences are terrible just  for money, power. Whos the hero here?"
For now 
"I'm a big fan of Tesla and all, but Tesla is a teeny, tiny company compared to the others.  "
Am I correct when I say Tesla is the only US auto maker it's not trying to farm business offshore to increase their profits? I know they're talking about a Chinese plant but that's in addition to the existing infrastructure as opposed to a cheaper replacement.
"But the paid trolls will never stop spreading lies & BS, as long as somebody keeps paying them.  "
Wouldn't a better comparison be to other energy companies? 
"As far as I am concerned, Trump is an idiot if he actively works to not allow Tesla to complete the 400k preorders of this American company with items made in America. "
"This is so silly. Of course a single relatively tiny company is going to get smaller subsidies than two huge vital industries. 

TSLA would have been bankrupt years ago without government subsidies. Its been their entire economic model since the financial crisis."
"While the comparison isn't really apt, they also completely leave out the fact that consumers receive a significant tax rebate when purchasing an electric vehicle (and a solar PV system) which is really another subsidy for Tesla."
"Subsidies are bad. Arguing Tesla isn't as guilty of cashing in on the govt. dole as other companies doesn't make it better.

How about no subsidies or preferential tax treatment for any company or industry? How about every business compete on the merits of their product/service?

While we're at it, how about a carbon tax to account for the external costs of fossil fuel use?"
"God forbid that there be more than one electric car company. It might give the illusion of an actual, functioning market. "
In Norway waht we subsidies the oil industry with we earn back and even more then that Tesla on the other hand its only American getting rich from that and also wealthy Norwegian that get a sports car for next to nothing and can drive in the bus lane.

Good point. If you look at the source data, the images track state/local subsides since 2007 for Tesla (the majority of subsidies were since FY15; the Gigafactory) and since 1992 for Ford (the majority of subsidies were since FY10). Similarly, Federal awards were since 2010 for Tesla, but include awards since 2000 for Ford.

"I think your framing is a little off, but you have the right idea

i.e. saying subsidies are bad, but lets account for the external cost of FF use is quite contradictory

What you really want to do is look at the economics of externalities, both positive and negative. In other words, you want pigouvian taxes and pigouvian subsidies; both are by definition required to avoid market failure.

As it stands EV subsidies exist because we treat EV's as a positive externality (they benefit society relative to ICE's via improved air quality, small GHG emissions, etc...) and society should have to pay in for that in order to have an efficient market (it's a pigouvian subsidy)

in an absolute sense when EV's aren't replacing ICE's, but rather other EV's (i.e. they have a large market share) then its no longer a positive externality and pigouvian subsidies are no longer necessary

Of course you also want to push the cost of society from FF use (negative externality) on to the creators of these emissions (consumers that use FF) via carbon taxes (a pigouvian tax)
"
"and stop make roads free, as free gimme for cars"
Tesla doesn't pay *income* taxes because they don't make money.
The vast majority (over half) of the subsidies for Tesla are similar tax breaks from Nevada that were used to lure Tesla to Nevada.
"Their source, http://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org shows individuals listings by date.

Scrolling through the pages of GM subsidy/loan listings for the period since 2007 (Tesla's first listing) will make you lose your will to live, whereas Tesla's had 9. Ford almost equalled Tesla's lifetime subsidies on a single deal with Michigan in 2010.

Hell, never mind the American manufacturers - looking at BMW, they've had $10.326bn support since 2007, compared with $2.872 for Tesla. Weirdly it's mostly in federal loans rather than state subsidies."
"It's a rebuttal to an actual propaganda campaign and a disingenuous LA Times [article](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html#page=1).

These guys are attempting to focus the American people's resentment of subsidies on Tesla. They're trying to make Elon Musk the face of subsidies, and that is disingenuous. Like you said, it's just one relatively small company in a see of subsidies, yet they somehow get the finger pointed at them. "
How did this get over 40 upvotes?
As well as electric subsidies.
"It's hard to say who has the moral high ground when it comes to subsidies.  There is such a complicated web of implicit and explicit subsidies that no one really knows who is subsidized and by what amount.  What's $1 of loan guarantees worth vs $1 of direct subsidy vs $1 of direct to consumer rebate vs $1 of tax reduction in future dollars?  Add to this the lack of carbon taxes, and the altered depreciation schedules of oil/gas, the benefits like HOV access electric vehicles gain, and you'd be hard pressed to know up from down."
"When you understand the U.S. political system, it makes perfect sense.

Ethanol is a prime example, everyone in the U.S. knows it's bad.

Come election time, the Republican and Democrat candidates do a 180 and say they love the corn ethanol program."
I would be curious to see the subsidy/vehicle or the subsidy/mWh. That seems to me the most relevant metric.

"The factory was on a ""fire sale"" thanks to the recession but the same recession nearly killed tesla because of problems with financing in 2008 that were solved by Daimler investment "

Officially canon.
"He's going to stomp their faces in. Once Tesla sets up a factory, they don't need to pay for energy consumption any more. They got that vertical integration or whatever thing going, it's like a fountain of cars and advanced robotics once it starts.

Erase all energy subsidies and put that money to use in a UBI. People are going to spend it in what they want, be it petrol or solar panels. Let the consumer decide for themselves and free market take its course."
Not too big to fail. We're just in a capitalist market where failing is dependent upon the competition's ability to take away customers. Once Tesla offers more affordable solutions to the average consumer then conventional producers will start having to acclimate or fail. 
"It's more than that. Rather than using the profits from fossil fuels to invest in green energy, they would fund corporate propaganda to protect their profits and to slow down progress on green energy."
They'd have a lot harder time of it if they were forced to deal with the environmental externalities they create with their products.
"So does everybody else making batteries at this time because China is One of the few countries that's really exploiting rare earths.  Hopefully we will see batteries in the future that are a lot cheaper to make and don't require lithium etc.

Without going back and reading what I originally wrote (Mobile) what my intention was [in case I misspoke] to express that Tesla is starting up production outside the country but they're not moving production outside the country to make a bigger profit by cutting loose American workers. They're not cutting jobs in the US to move their plants somewhere where labour is cheaper. Automakers and other businesses that have or will move manufacturing to Mexico (or wherever ) are doing so  to reduce production costs and increase profits and more often than not that costs jobs. "
"> because there was something Yuge in it...for him.

fair enough."
You can't compare percentages of a mature industry operating at economies of scale to a newer one not yet operating at comparable economies of scale.
"If you do it by percentages, the subsidy for TSLA would look absurdly inappropriate because TSLA is such a tiny company and has received a lot of subsidies/loans/etc the past 8 years or so. Like I said, the company would have been bankrupt and ceased to exist 8 years ago without subsidies. 


> WRT your second point: to be fair, all the other auto manufacturers that got bailed out would have also gone under had they not.

Not all of them, but yes, GM along with TSLA would have been out of business. But the energy companies would have been fine. 


But overall, subsidies play a far greater role for TSLA than the general auto industry and definitely the oil industry. 

It should be interesting how things play out in the next few years. If Trump really frees the energy industry, then oil prices will stay long and gas prices will stay low and people will be buying non-electric vehicles. 


I hope TSLA succeeds because the TSLA nutjobs worship Musk as if he were kim jongun or something. It's crazy. "
"For their electric cars, yes. But those are a small % of what they sell, vs 100% of the car Tesla sells "
"Sure, but eligible sales only account for an incredibly tiny portion of their business"
"It's the government using tax dollars to pick winners and losers, even if the market (ie citizens) don't think it's important enough to support at it's true cost. If Americans ""agree"" that Tesla is the right direction, they would be willing to buy the car for a little more money without subsidies. In fact, only a tiny % of the marketplace would need to feel that way to keep Tesla afloat... Instead tax dollars are used to bring the consumer cost down. all of this is independent of the actual good Tesla does, my post could just as easily be applied to Corn subsidies if that helps "
You don't have a problem with the government subsidizing luxury cars?
"There are sources of investments in startups that do not demand subsidising it by the government.

Subsidies should be used to realise the policy of government like solving problems that are hard to be priced in by the market.
Carbon tax is superior to subsidies on EV but the tax breaks on EV are a good way to improve the air quality and with it decrease health care spending  "
Why?
"I'm not sure I'm on the same page:

- Subsidies, as a general rule, discourage efficiency. A $7500 tax credit for new EV buyers, for example, encourages automakers to increase the price of their vehicles as much as $7500

- Taxes, on the other hand, tend to be partially absorbed by manufacturers...if there's a tax on gasoline, for example, some (but not all) of the cost is passed on to the consumers. Gasoline producers and retailers take some of the hit, forcing them to become even more efficient

While there's a point of diminishing returns of course, it's far better to tax someone than it is to give someone money for these reasons.

I'd argue that taxing alcohol has forced producers them to improve their marketing, streamline their production, and maximize the performance of their retailers. The same would not be accomplished by subsidizing some other beverage."
"Having apparently too much time on my hands, here's a list for all relevant manufacturers during the same time period as Tesla's listings (so, since 2007).

"It is not a good source, however. 

Tesla and it's consumers hasn't really received $2.872bn. More than $1bn of it is the [limit on the tax breaks Tesla may have over a 20 year period of production on the Nevada's Gigafactory](https://electrek.co/2015/06/02/complete-breakdown-of-the-4-9-billion-in-government-support-the-la-times-claims-elon-musks-companies-are-receiving/), but has not received yet nor has the guarantee of receiving as it depends on many future goals they have to achieve.

And if it is counting BMW loan as a whole as opposing to to what extent the interest rate was subsidized, it is also a deeply flawed number for them."
"Calling the one article skeptical of Musk's achievements ""propaganda"" while giving a free pass to the coordinated, constant stream of pro-Musk content in every other cosmopolitan media publication is rich as fuck, man.

No. It's propaganda against propaganda. Like I said.

Well it isn't ""subsidies"". It's pretty much supporting a lone billionaire keep his company afloat. 

>They're trying to make Elon Musk the face of subsidies

He is. TSLA doesn't exist without subsidies. 

> Like you said, it's just one relatively small company in a see of subsidies, yet they somehow get the finger pointed at them.

Sure, but the subsidies are an existential necessity to TSLA ( a tiny company ) and it's primarily enriching a lone billionaire ( musk ).

"I think you might be missing the point of pigouvian taxes/subsidies, it's not really ""picking a winner"" so much as ending a textbook case of market failure. BEV incentives and carbon pricing exist not to support a particular company, but rather internalize externalities that competing products use to gain a competitive advantage to the detriment of society and force an inefficient market. These are quantifiable and objective externalities...."
"> Subsidies, as a general rule, discourage efficiency

No. Pigouvian subsidies are internalizing positive externalities, by definition they increase efficiency. (the common textbook examples used here are education and healthcare, a ""free"" market in these sectors creates inefficient outcomes) This is the same reasoning as a pigouvian tax (i.e. carbon tax, alcohol tax, etc). In the case of pigouvian subsidies society benefits from the product more than they contribute (I.e. is a freeloader), and has to pay in that benefit via a subsidy. Benefiting without paying in your share is a textbook case of inefficiency.
"
"We should also be comparing those numbers against the number of vehicles sold in the US. The earliest year that Tesla has any meaningful sales was 2012, so I'll use 2013 through YTD 2016 as the time range.

Still not quite a fair comparison, but Tesla is clearly being subsidized *far* more than those other manufacturers.

"I called the LA Times article disingenuous. My usage of ""propaganda"" was referencing the Conservative PAC ""Citizens of the Republic"". I agree that this article is biased in favor of Musk. I didn't give any free passes. I just said it was a rebuttal of an actual propaganda campaign and a disingenuous article. 

The author wrote the article to defend Tesla against claims made by another author. It would feel more like propaganda to me if he wrote this article just for the sake of bragging on Elon Musk and Tesla. "
"It's propaganda. 

Big Oil wants to go hard during the Trump presidency. Expect to see Tesla/solar/electric get shit on for the next 4-8 years. Climate science will also be under fire."
"So you are saying there is not a well funded anti Elon propaganda campaign? 

There is one. 

Why?"
"I'm not a Musk fanboy like many people on Reddit. I'm not super familiar with his story, but I'm more intrigued by the people like you that seem to hate him. 

I'm curious why do you dislike him so much. Are you just contrarian because of the circle jerk or do you have a legitimate reason? He seems to be a decent human being with a focus on innovating and improving average humans' lives. 

We have a nasty problem with innovation getting bought up and/or stifled by corporations to limit competition. We should have had a decent electric car long before now, but no one was innovating. That's reason enough for me to commend Musk. 

I also really like the idea of a solar roof and a battery pack on my house. 

These are products that are totally feasible today but weren't even on my radar a decade ago. I'm glad he's fighting that fight. 

With plenty of folks like you out there along with the fossil fuel lobbies, it's still an uphill battle regardless of the size of the circle jerk. "
"But, again, the Fremont factory is in the Bay Area... one of the most expensive real estate markets in the entire country. It's not in the middle of the desert, it's plopped in the middle of medium density suburbia. 

You're thinking of the Gigafactory in Nevada, which is a different thing. "
"Yup... Though it seems pretty shitty that those companies can play hardball in good times using ""free market!"" as logic but in bad times can rely on the govt to bail them out. "
Almost anything other than the internal combustion engine or a coal fired steam engine....  i'm looking forward to loading my roof up with solar panels to charge an electric car or to generate my own hydrogen. Something like that.
"So, you're saying that subsidies are required for things like healthcare or education for the common good, as they facilitate outsized outcomes?

In the US today, healthcare and education are *highly* subsidized. And - arguably - they are quite deficient.

I think this is a situation where theory and reality diverge. In theory, giving students and universities a subsidy facilitates higher education. In reality, it results in massive student loan debt and a lot of economically inefficient 4-yr degrees in ""dance"" and ""sports medicine."" This is because there's an economic incentive to provide education, even when said education lacks value.

If you wanted to advocate for outcome based payments - eg, paying people when good things happened (like staying healthy for 10 years in a row, or graduating with a 4-year degree) - and wanted to refer to these as 'pigouvian subsidies', so be it. I think that's a healthy concept that's less vulnerable to inefficiencies.

But again, subsidies (as payments to distort the supply/demand curve) inevitably discourage economic efficiency. The evidence is literally everywhere we look."
"Definitely not a fair comparison because the vast majority of Tesla's subsidies are state incentives for establishing factories. Genuine question because I don't know, but how many factories have the other manufacturers set up in the States since 2007?"
Do you not agree that this article is also extremely disingenuous?
"Big oil is not really concerned with solar and EV at the moment but with the supply glut that dropped the price of oil since 2014.
Impact of extra supply thanks to new capacity is much larger than booming renewable sector that even with it's incredible growth dynamics is relatively small compared with global energy sector"
[removed]
The rate of technology is faster than anyone imagined. I think the world will be just fine.
"> So, you're saying that subsidies are required for things like healthcare or education for the common good, as they facilitate outsized outcomes?

Outsized outcomes are not why they're economically efficient; society benefits from healthy and educated individuals, by definition if society doesn't pay in the benefits it's a distortion to the supply/demand curve.

> In the US today, healthcare and education are highly subsidized. And - arguably - they are quite deficient.

Yes and no. For example your single payer Medicare system is very efficient in terms of overhead, this is representative of most healthcare systems in the rest of the world. The rest of your healthcare system is an outlier, the least cost effective in the developed world - that's a structural issue, not a subsidy issue.

> I think this is a situation where theory and reality diverge

No, not at all. Once again, the proof is in the pudding, almost all of the industrialized societies in the world have much better education outcomes overall with much lower cost to the students. Once again, society has to pay in for its benefits, and it works. The US has structural problems treating public goods as private, this isn't a counterexample to pigouvian taxes/subsidies.

> But again, subsidies (as payments to distort the supply/demand curve) inevitably discourage economic efficiency

Still no! The supply/demand curve is distorted if someone benefits without paying in, or someone can push their costs off to someone else (positive/negative externalities)

The absence of a carbon tax is a distortion that discourages economic efficiency. The absence of public education being taxpayer sponsored is a distortion that discourages economic efficiency. The absence of public health services being taxpayer sponsored is a distortion that discourages economic efficiency. The list goes on and on and on.

The only noteworthy thing is that measuring the size of an externality is incredibly difficult (see research on the social cost of carbon for example). That's why you generally only bother trying to quantify large, obvious externalities (i.e. carbon pricing) - because if it's very costly to determine the magnitude of a small externality, the cost of doing so may outweigh the benefits of fixing it."
"True. I'm not really in the mood to research it, but looking through [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_automotive_assembly_plants_in_the_United_States) there are quite a few that have been built in the last decade.

Though at the same time, a big chunk of Tesla's subsidies are tied directly to individual car sales."
"Other ways to compare would almost certainly be better :

- Subsidies / Employee
- Subsidies / Investments
- Subsidies / Capitalisation (this one less than the other 2 above)"
Does it also include the subsidy buyers get? Sure it's not Tesla/Nissan that gets the subsidy directly but it somehow is in their favour too. That's another 4-10k per Tesla again.
"I would love to hear why. I'm being genuine. It seems to me like they rebutted multiple claims made by other articles. Those rebuttals could be disingenuous, but I don't know enough about Tesla to say that.  

I agree that Tesla does use federal subsidies, but they don't claim that they do not. 

I don't think it's as disingenuous as the LA Times article that seems to be from a world where Tesla is the only company in America to take subsidies. This is all my opinion though. I am open minded. Enlighten me. "
"> Big oil is not really concerned with solar and EV at the moment but with the supply glut that dropped the price of oil since 2014.

Expect that to change rapidly. Trump & Big Oil wants to production ramp up production while we're in the middle of a supply glut? Also getting friendly with Putin after the USA and Russia have been fighting proxy wars over control of oil in the Middle East for decades?

Were I to guess, Trump and Putin have decided to team up to challenge Saudi Arabia's dominance of the oil market. Renewables are a potential threat they want to mitigate now before it cuts into profits later."

"Hey,go back to r/The_Donald you rambling fool."
"I hope so. I believe we're at a real tipping point as far as climate change is concerned, it won't take much to push us over the edge either way.  

It bothers me immensely that we are where we are right now because of greed. All the technology that has become critical today, and alternative fuel vehicles are only one of those technologies, we could have had a couple decades ago or even longer. The oil industry didn't want to give up its stranglehold on the automotive industry and made a conscious and close to successful effort to destroy the electric car.  Even now, instead of looking to the future for their children, there are powerful people trying to slow down the implementation of solar power in a lot of places, governors who won't allow Teslas to be sold in their state even though they're completely American-made. All so they can have more money in their bank accounts. That's one of the things I really admire about Elon Musk, he is successful but he still clearly cares about the environment and wants a better world for his children. If a few more powerful people felt that way things might be very different right now.  Imagine if the EV1s hadn't been crushed, if they had been perfected. 

/r"
"I appreciate your points re: structural issues, but I'm not sure that infrastructure investment (say, investing in education infrastructure or health infrastructure or roads and bridges) is a subsidy.

Put another way: I know that giving EV buyers a $7500 tax credit is a subsidy to EV automakers. But paying for education for all that want it - or healthcare for all that need it? Those aren't subsidies, per se, because they don't *defray* costs.

Still, I wonder if our argument is semantic. I argue taxes are better than payments, but I suppose one could claim they are essentially one in the same..."
Looking at the individual subsidies [here](http://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org/prog.php?parent=tesla-motors) it appears that somewhere between 50%-95% of Tesla's state subsidies are attributed to the Gigafactory.
"Literally 99% of the subsidies are from Nevada state, which is associated solely with the upcoming factory (plus the usual stores, Superchargers and service centres). As u/nsandiegoJoe says, there's one initial $1.3bn balloon figure in 2014 when Gigafactory groundwork began, and the rest was in the form of state tax credits in 2015 (including a little from California). According to Electrek, around $1bn of Gigafactory funds are payable over 20 years rather than up front, but I don't know their source for that.

Until 2014, the company had received a grand total of $647,626 in subsidies, in the form of training reimbursement. It doesn't appear that *any* corporate subsidies are tied directly to individual car sales. Presumably the federal EV grant is applicable to the buyer rather than the seller.

---

Looking at the list of US car factories, *none* of the big three have built any since 2007. GM built two in the preceding five years, both of which combined are massively smaller and with fewer employees than the planned Gigafactory.

The only manufacturers from the list above who've built factories in the US since 2007 are Toyota and Volkswagen, both of which are about the size of the Gigafactory *now*, and employ 30/50% of the planned number of workers. VW also published their investment for their Chattanooga plant, which was a fifth of the Gigafactory's ultimate figure of $5bn (although Tesla has apparently spent $431m so far; unsure how much Panasonic has spent)."
"In short: because Tesla is a much smaller company. The amount of subsidies they've received *per vehicle sold* is far higher than those other manufacturers.

And this isn't the first time Electrek has pulled this sort of crap. A few months ago they published an article claiming that the Model S was the #1 luxury car in the US, but they were excluding models of BMW and Mercedes that are undeniably in the same class as the Model S."

"I'm not worried about it... none of the predictions from 2005 came true, the ocean is able to dissipate far more heat than we thought. The AL gore prediction was 6 inches in 10 years... we've had 2 millimeters, but the climate change policies enacted have disproportionately affected poor regions of the world.

I'm not saying do nothing, I'm saying the pace we are at is perfect, any knee jerk reaction could have unintended consequences. "
"They have the Gigafactory lumped into a single line-item, so it would be 53%.

That's less than half their overall subsidies, leaving $1.585 billion."
The Gigafactory isn't an automobile assembly plant.
"That's very disingenuous. I agree. 

Another question: does being an EV company result in more subsidy opportunities? Is that the reason they get more per car? "
"Wow.

I'll bet you're fun at parties."
"Dude, you are a one-man circlejerk."
"I don't think that all Gigafactory related subsidies are that single line item. When all California subsidies amount $15.6 million, how can none of the remaining $1.1 billion Nevada subsidies not have anything to do with the Gigafactory?

Edit: also that single line item is for 2014 while the others are all 2015. Probably broken up instead of lumped. There's no way that Tesla sells enough cars in Nevada to claim $1.1 Billion in State subsidies compared to the much larger state of California which only claimed $15.6 million."
"Okay, so the numbers listed looks like it has nothing to do with car sale subsidies and everything to do with factory subsidies for new job creation. 

Look at the details for each Nevada subsidy and notice the Number of Jobs or Training Slots item tagged on all of them: 6,500. This corresponds directly to [exhibit A](http://nytimes.com/2014/09/13/business/nevada-woos-tesla-plant-in-tax-deal-but-economic-benefits-prompt-debate.html) which explains the initial $1.3 billion line item in 2014 as an incentives package for the Gigafactory which is expected to create 6,500 new jobs.

Compare that with the $15 million California subsidy in 2015 which includes a Number of Jobs item of 4,426. [Exhibit B](https://www.google.com/amp/www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-tesla-grabs-california-subsidy-20150609-story,amp.html?client=ms-android-att-aio-us) explains this subsidy as an award for creating 4,426 new jobs by 2019.

Finally, [Exhibit C](http://www.rgj.com/story/news/2014/09/04/nevada-strikes-billion-tax-break-deal-tesla/15096777/) breaks down what some of the other Nevada 2015 subsidy line items are for although it appears some of them changed slightly from when this was written in 2014:

>A 100 percent sales tax abatement for 20 years: $725 million
>
>A 100 percent real and personal property tax abatement for 10 years: $332 million
>
>A 100 percent modified business tax (payroll tax) abatement for 10 years: $27 million"
"They don't get more per car. They get the same amount of federal subsidies per EV as any other manufacturer for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the US in the form of a $7,500 tax credit to the consumer.

In addition to that, we talk about State subsidies in the form of EV credits in the States that do mandate EV sales quotas or buying EV credits in lieu of it (such as in California). However, Tesla actually benefits less from these EV credits than some of the other manufacturers do. Some manufacturers opt to build EVs at or near cost just for the EV credits they'll get and therefore not have to buy to make up any deficit in their EV sales quota.

Say that each EV produced by one manufacturer earns $10,000 worth of credits that the manufacture doesn't have to buy. Tesla only makes EVs so the only use Tesla has for the credits is to sell them, except that other manufacturers know this and want a deal only buying the credits at 50 cents on the dollar. Tesla therefore sells it's $10,000 worth of credits for only $5,000. Additionally, Tesla can't afford to sell EVs at or near production cost since it doesn't have ICE vehicles to turn profit as others manufacturers can do just to meet their EV quotas. In this way, Tesla benefits less from the State EV credit subsidies per vehicle than GM does for example."
Definitely. Though I don't really see how it matters. They still benefit.
Just look at his post history. Reeks of anti American and is constantly resorting to name calling like a teenager.
No. What I said is I hate the circlejerkers. 
"Gotcha. Thank you for being real with me. I do kind of agree with companies like TSLA having more opportunity at subsidies. They are innovating in an industry that has been stuck in cruise control for a century. I'm a big fan of competition. Especially where Energy is concerned. Without a big helping hand from the government, they wouldn't even be able to get their foot in the door. 

Also, if they were taking substantially more than other automakers, I would be more suspicious, but the subsidies seem reasonable for the industry. 

My red flag is how dependent they are, as a private company, on subsidies. I do not really believe the last part of this article where it says that Elon Musk would rather not have any subsidies for any company at all. I would think they needed it more than anyone else on the industry. I would have to hear a great counterpoint to change my mind on that one. 

I still support his cause of disrupting the fossil fuel and automotive industries though. "
You might find better ways of communicating your feelings then.
Who the fuck cares what you hate? Stop being so self-important.
"What bugs me about it is that they're selling luxury cars. Someone who is willing to spend $80,000 on a car shouldn't be getting a subsidy."
"That's very true! 

They have had a long-term plan to create the affordable model, 3 right? I am pretty positive I read that on Reddit. Lol 

That's a great point though. I am in no position whatsoever to buy any current model, and they have been getting my tax dollars for a few years now. 

I could actually afford the Model 3, but it's not even out yet. 

Thank you for helping me to empathize with the counterpoint of Tesla being subsidized. That makes so much since. "
Say that to Bush and the rest of people that created the federal incentives. USA republicans seems to love giving rich people tax breaks. This is just another example of that.
"The long-term plan is to make each generation significantly less expensive than the last. The Model 3 will be the 3rd generation (following Roadster and Model S/X), but it'll still be an expensive car."
"Yes the model 3 is slated to come out in less than a year and will have a  $35k base price.  A huge percentage of the Tesla subsidies surround the production facilities to build that car at volume and are tied to delivering on job creation benchmarks.  

The argument about an $80k car not needing subsidies isn't really valid here particularly because Tesla is scaling up every generation into lower cost/higher volume.  Part of the rabid fan base and support for Tesla is exactly because of this.  There are a lot of people that buy a Tesla at that price point that would never have previously considered spending that much on a car because of what supporting the company means for the future.  To a person stretching their finances to reach that price bracket the subsidies can be what makes it possible. Tesla is a very unusual business case because of all these dynamics.  


I'm glad there have been some healthy counter arguments in this thread.  It really depends on how you count and compare subsidies.  

What I do consider important is that the narrative that Tesla exists by being propped up by the government as a special case gets beaten back.  That idea is false.  Each subsidy returns some value to the government.  California and Nevada are paying for jobs, EV subsidies are paying to accelerate a technology so that American businesses are leaders in an industry that is expected to explode in the future.  

Elon and Tesla have also openly invited a zero subsidies level playing field.  They know this isn't going to happen anytime soon but it has served to point out how subsidized the entire automotive and energy industries are."
I definitely agree. Though in this particular case it's clearly the Democrats.

Hot damn 85% + sure is a big vote of confidence. It also heavily weakens the handful of lawsuits aimed at stopping this merger. Very excited to see what this means for the future of Tesla Energy; over time this capability will become a plug-&-play power plant that scales from individual consumption up to nation-state levels. 
What day will SCTY stock officially become TSLA stock?
"> more than 85% of shares voted were cast in favor of the acquisition

Amazing!"
Yay! At least my vote counted in this election.

Great news! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HBdRCroks
Nice! Way to step it up guys!
Very exciting news! Let the future begin. 
Let the solar roof live long amd prosper!!! :)
"Well, now we get to find out how much those roofs will actually cost..."
could someone explain the US ev-incentives Elon is referring to that only have a 50 cent value on the dollar for Tesla? Thanks!
"And the news about the cost is tremendous!!!  Everyone has been waiting for the other shoe to drop on this.  ""Sure it's a great idea, but it sounds like it's going to be a long payback period""..., but then Elon comes out with ""We think it's going to about the same as a non-solar roof.""  

Holy crap!

However, I think he must be talking about a comparison to higher-end roofs made of concrete or ceramics, like he mentioned in the his supply-chain cost remarks.  There's no way it's going to be cost competitive with traditional asphalt shingles."
Taking a -40% loss on SCTY. Whatever long term --for the future. 
elon musk wanted it? Good enough for me to vote for it.
"""These things are puzzling."" LOL. I love you Elon"
Doesn't Elon Musk's cousin own SolarCity?
I had forgotten today was the closing day... It was a nice surprise to check on my trading account :)
so would this be the best time to buy TSLA? or should I still wait after merge
The mix of storage plus generation will be great combined. That being said how do they make the solar city division cash flow positive when they were having issues before?
Awwwwwwww yis!

That new SOLR roof + battery pack demo sealed the deal!
This does nothing but put the vehicle side at risk.  I don't see how you see this as something to celebrate. 
"It's likely that those most opposed to the merger already sold off their stock, which explains why the stock is where it's at. "
"I agree.

Those who invested in Tesla in the first place most likely also trust Elon, and they understand the benefit of acquiring SolarCity. Those who appose the merger are mainly two groups of people: the people who shorted Tesla and SolarCity, and the bashers. I talk to lots of Tesla investors, I have never seen one guy said ""I sold my Tesla shares because I don't like the merger with SCTY"".

It's the bashers who created this false impression that shareholders don't like the merger. Elon from very beginning said based on his discussion with institutional shareholders, it will likely be approved by super majority. Once again, Elon has been telling the truth. Bashers, shorts (disguised as analysts) have been lying. This has been typical for the past 6~7 years. 

Remember bashers said these things thousands of times?

Model S will never be built - wrong

All Tesla cars will burn in fire - wrong

Batteries will degrade 50% in 2 years - wrong (only degrade 6% after 200k miles.)

Tesla will never build superchargers - wrong

Gigafactory is a gimmick to push up stocks  -wrong

Tesla will not be able to drop battery cost - wrong

New battery tech will bankrupt Tesla - wrong

Autopilot will never work - wrong

At best Tesla is just a niche car maker - wrong 

Model X can never be built - wrong

Tesla loses money on every car - wrong

The list goes very long.

I have never seen one thing that turned out bashers were right. But they will keep bashing anyway. I know they are just paid liars.

Edit: format"
If this goes through and no issues it's usually the date of closure of the deal.
It looks like investors are very excited about the acquisition! 
this is why i didn't vote on the merger lol
Not including Elon's voting power too. Did he technicalpy need to sit it out?
Exactly how I feel!
"Well you can either listen to the billionaire who got rich with paypal, build up the first new independent car company in the west in decades and also builts rockets that go to space and come back to land.

"George Carlin said it best when it came to Sun worshipping:


“I've begun worshipping the sun for a number of reasons. First of all, unlike some other gods I could mention, I can see the sun. It's there for me every day. And the things it brings me are quite apparent all the time: heat, light, food, and a lovely day. There's no mystery, no one asks for money, I don't have to dress up, and there's no boring pageantry. And interestingly enough, I have found that the prayers I offer to the sun and the prayers I formerly offered to 'God' are all answered at about the same 50% rate.”
― George Carlin, Brain Droppings"
Praise the sun! \o/
"Actually, the whole idea that Jesus is the Son (Sun) of God (or son of man) takes on a whole new meaning if you read [The Jesus Mysteries: Was the ""Original Jesus"" a Pagan God?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_Mysteries)

The book is an extraordinary read that can at the same time strengthen and diminish a person's faith depending on how open minded you may be."

The future is always beginning...
"My best guess, from my memory of previous quarterly calls where Elon mentioned it: 

States have rules that car manufacturers (OEMs) must produce a certain number of EVs (a minimum percentage of their total production). Most OEMs do not meet this quota, so a secondary market has been created where companies like Tesla (who produce way more EVs than the law requires), can sell their extra credits to the other OEMs who are falling short. However, Tesla being cash starved has a greater desire to sell these credits than the OEMs have a desire to buy them, so the OEMs wait and wait until Tesla offers a big discount (50 cents on the dollar), and then buy them up like that."
"Brit here, I had never heard of asphalt shingles until these const comparison. Much less of a thing here. It's ceramics and slate all the way, for better or worse"
"Asphalt shingles have similar supply chain issues, I imagine. I was quoted by 2 companies over $15k for my roof (and then they said I was lucky I wasn't paying $20k). Ended up with a local company and paying less than $8k.

It is all a matter of the comparisons, and there's a lot of slop that can probably be taken out of the industry as he claims."
About the same as a traditional roof *after you factor in 50 years of savings on your power bill*.
"Maybe, maybe not. It's not a loss until you actually sell it. If those TSLA stocks you get from it go up, your position improves."
"I'm sort of in the same boat, but how does that actually work? I mean you haven't ""lost"" anything until you sell.  If your shares drop 40% then convert to Tesla and rise a bunch, isn't that just as good?
"
Just sold a good chunk of other stocks and bought solar city hoping this pay off 
Elon is the largest shareholder and is chairman. His cousin is ceo. 
"Depends on what you're trying to achieve. If you're looking to hold long-term, it won't matter all that much. 
Plus, the share price has already adjusted to the merger anyways. GL"
Just use the money you would spend on the roof towards a Model S instead and then you could get it really quick.
"Tesla isn't a car company anymore, they're an energy company that sells cars"
"And then there's people like me who opposed the merger, but voted for the merger anyway.  Because I recognize Elon knows better than I do what the future looks like.

I'm the guy who thinks Tesla should have purchased Solar City after bankruptcy at pennies on the dollar in a few years, rather than now at a premium above where the shares were traded.  But that couldn't happen because of Elon's intertwined baskets of companies (lots of SpaceX money tied up in SCTY bonds).

Then I watched to the solar roof dog and pony show, and decided I don't know what I'm talking about.

Then I thought about the solar roof unveil, and I thought, that really was a dog and pony show on a lot of levels.

And then I still voted for the merger.  Because it's amazing to watch what Tesla is doing, and I'd never want to be responsible for limiting it in any way."
Don't forget stockholder living outside the US. Didn't get any info on voting in Germany here.
"hahahaha!  Nice. XD.  I'd be mildly interested in a compiled list of the doom-and-gloom predictions or perhaps a wall of shame esp. for semi-major public figures emphatic yet failed assertions of such just for giggles because sometimes I feel as if I'm in the Twilight Zone when carrying on in person discussions with particularly overly-cynical-toward-Tesla folks.  Although, to be fair, folks generally are much more up-beat about Tesla nowadays."
"Tesla is still so far a niche car maker, but I'm feeling optimistic"
WHEN WILL THEN BE NOW? Can't wait to unload this SCTY stock.
"When I first heard about merger when it was announced, I was a bit unsure. I thought that between ramping up the production if the Model 3 and the Gigafactory that merging with another company was a bit much for Tesla to deal with. 

However, after the Solar Roof reveal, I was giddy with excitement. The merger totally clicked for me. 

I bet a lot of minds were convinced after the reveal.  ""No brainer"" said analyst. "
"speaking personally, I just have faith in his vision."
This is why I voted - to show the strong support. I knew it would pass by super majority.
"Technically not, but it vastly weakens any lawsuits against it."
I like the rocket guy more
"I have heard announcements where people say ""an historic"" while pronouncing the ""h"".  Usually it is only done when it sounds like a vowel at the front of the word, but historic must be some strange quirk where people pronounce the ""h"" and still say ""an""."
French accent does a silent h. 
"It could be something about not being a native speaker. I wouldn't be surprised if I did plenty of mistakes like that (and in the past, it's been pointed that I do indeed)."
"Do you drink an herbal tea or a herbal tea?

I think an historic is becoming accepted in the US nowadays.  The usage is such that both are considered ""correct"" now."
And that's why Carlin was a genius. 
Your prayers must be really tame if 50% of them come true...

"No, he specifically said that the near cost equivalency was WITHOUT the energy savings. "
It would need to rise ~60% for me to break even
"You will get whatever ratio of Tesla stock that you would have gotten had you sold your shares at the acquisition price and bought Tesla shares.

I can't say exactly, because I don't know how the merger is structured. If you want to own Tesla stock anyways, I would just sell the Solar City at a loss and carry the capital losses. You can buy Tesla, let it rise a little, and then sell it and offset the gains hit with your carried losses.

That is, if taxes are a big consideration for you. Otherwise just let it turn into Tesla."
"True I haven't ""lost"" anything but I am still doing the calculations for break even."
"adjusted down, TSLA is about 30-40 bucks below where it was when the merger was announced and never hit that high point since."
yes for long term investment. 
"And being a car company 'on the side' is a very good way to no longer be a car company.  They are badly, BADLY underestimating the effort it will take to grow as an automaker

"I think SCTY was about assuring/maintaining control of joint strategies & minimizing Tesla/SCTY/SpaceX disruption (SpaceX had incidentally invested in SCTY bonds).  It's also buying it at a point when the market is (momentarily IMO) undervaluing solar.  Picking it up after any bankruptcy would have been an unacceptable disruption is my WAG.

_____

Random though on Paypal.  Elon wanted to take it all the way in replacing banking system, but his employees insisted on selling out to Ebay (and all revolted in a way.)  Now it's $50B and too big for Elon to trivially buy out.  If perception of solar company was elevated, Tesla would risk being in bidding war with another company and combined w/ cost of disruption of plans and share price depression from TSLA-story negative impact (all of which are signficiant IMO); e.g. It'd possibly disrupt Buffalo PV plant deal and cause doubts in partner (Panasonic.)  [Getting SCTY] assured synergies remained not only active, but very likely enhanced."
"That is the issue.  Elon is moving at the speed of light to stay ahead of anyone else.  Waiting a year or two to buy solar city in bankruptcy is a huge amount of time wasted that you can't get back.

That is why buying it before bankruptcy makes sense, it is worth the money to be 1-2 years ahead of where you otherwise would be.  It also guarantees you get solar city.  Waiting for bankruptcy means anyone could try to pick off assets and there would be no guarantee tesla got the pieces it wants."
Musk said that debt's have to be honored. It is likely that doing it this way is saving himself a bit in the public eye while making sure the transition is as smooth as possible.
"There is no reason to believe that solarcity would have gone bankrupt in lieu of Tesla. Their debt is mostly non-recourse, which means its backed by assets (in this case solar panels- like a mortgage backed by a person's house). Plus to get a solar power purchase agreement or lease-to-own from solarcity a person's credit score has to be above 650. So its debt backed by credit-worthy people and physical assets. That all said the liquidity problem must be what you're alluding to, which was improving independent of Tesla with more direct sales of solar panels and monetization of power purchase agreements. Money people owe on their future utility bills can be securitized same as money people owe on their future mortgage payments (""mortgage-backed"" securities), so even in a worst case cash-flow scenario they could bring future earnings forward to the present at the cost of a few percentage points lost in the securitization."
I'm out of the loop and just checked this subreddit because I saw the news of the merger. What 'solar roof dog and pony show'?
"Same here, i *think* that means the bank holding our share cast the vote."
"Heard they sell more high end cars than bmw these days, thats one hell of a niche. Not to mention getting 400k preorders for a car not even in production..."

"The strange quirk is that people think it's cool or somehow more correct to do it, even though it isn't. It's like people replacing the word ""who"" with ""whom"" everywhere instead of realizing they're two different words.

"My understanding is the rule is it's based on pronunciation rather than spelling necessarily (e.g., 'herbal' has silent 'h').[1]

Google's N-gram viewer chart of Brit vs US Engl. both show heavy trends toward ""a"" vs 'an'. (http://www.betterwritingskills.com/tip-w005.html) over last century.

Random aside: 

But I'm not a total grammarian/grammar-Nazi (http://www.iflscience.com/brain/being-grammar-nazi-might-reveal-something-about-your-personality/); it brings me great pleasure to know that language is living and changes over time (e.g., if enough of the public mistakenly or willfully uses a term different than some prescriptive form, it can (\*LoL\* non-figurative) literally change official prescriptive acceptance[2].  And I didn't downvote you.

The only thing that's worthy of respect! 
That's what I get for posting before watching the entire Q&A video.
On the other hand having another leg to stand on would be good if the automotive industry gets into trouble.
"Yeah Elon has no business experience, they should have hired you instead for sure."
your comment reminded me of how nice paypal was way back in the day. Long live Elon.
"Well, this is making a lot of assumptions.  He owned something like 26% of Solar City already -- so it wasn't like he was sitting back and  wasting time with it.

And given that Dow and Certainteed and basically everyone in the solar shingle game is going/went in the opposite direction, there wasn't a big competitive problem either.

The only reason I can see for the timing was to prevent his 26% of SCTY and the SpaceX money from going up in the ether of bankruptcy.

But Elon definitely sees things differently than I do.

For example, I would say something like, ""it is impossible to make a $140,000 car accelerate more quickly in a eighth mile than a $1 million dollar car.""  And Elon would come along and prove me wrong."
"It's cos he's a fucking Lannister - ""A Musk always pays his debts"""
">  So its debt backed by credit-worthy people and physical assets. 

It's almost like 2006-2008 never happened?  The last thing the world  needs are CDSes created out of solar power futures.

It's not just a liquidity problem Solar City was faced with.  It was a liquidity problem combined with the participation in a market that is basically a commodity market (more like wheat, corn, soy than it is like cars, airplanes, or even soda).  At least the differentiation problem existed prior to the solar roof.  The solar roof might change things.

No, the bigger problem is that we may have reached peak solar so quickly that there's [not as much growth left as most people assume.](http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN12Q0C1)  

The nice thing about the solar roof is that it really is a game changer to the extent that it could radically expand the market to applications where traditional panels were not appropriate.

But that still begs the question why there needed to be a merger to accomplish bringing the solar roofs to market.  "
He's talking about the fancy solar roof unveil that was done in hollywood at the set of the desperate housewives houses where they put solar roofs on all the houses there.

"While that website looks convincing, it is location specific. If historic is pronounced with a vowel sound at the start of the word, use 'an'"
"If you're implying he's an expert at every industry, before he enters it,  that's foolish."
"It's quite the nightmare now, isn't it? Especially now that eBay is always screwing with the requirements, and how PayPal handles buyer/seller disputes digitally, and behind a curtain of web forms."
"I made no assumption.  If they buy it now, they get it all now. If they wait a year or two, they lose 1-2 years of time.  No amount of money can get time back.  Plus 1 year would be fast for a company to go bankrupt, liquidate, and complete any sales of assets.  You are looking more like 2 - 3 years for tesla to get assets.  And heaven forbid solar city has a patent portfolio that is pieced out and bought by someone other than tesla."

""No sir, we call it: Mr. Coffee""

""Now that I have my coffee, I'm ready to watch my stocks.""

*[turns to Mr. Ticker]*"
"Yup. I agree. The standard American pronunciation includes the 'h' sound and therefore is preceded by ""a"". Regional variations exist, so if you pronounce ""historic"" without an 'h' sound then it is preceded by ""an""."
What industry are you an expert at? 
I'm sure Musk has the foresight to talk with people of the industry to help him find a good direction.  Someone like him wouldn't blindly stumble around until his way works out.
"Paypal was spun off in a separate company from eBay in 2014. By eBay screwing with requirements, are you talking about something other than buying stuff on eBay?"
"But there is no ""they lose time.""  That would only be true if Elon Musk wasn't on the board of directors and didn't already own more than a quarter of the company.

And in order to sell that patent portfolio, Musk, who owns directly a quarter of the company and probably could influence a majority of shares, would have to consent.

I don't think you understand the preexisting relationship between Musk as CHAIRMAN and a co-founder of Solar City and his cousin Lyndon Rive, CEO and also a co-founder  of Solar City.  [Do you really not know this history?](http://investors.solarcity.com/directors.cfm)

"
That's a 'nteresting way to explain it.
What's important here is you're clearly an expert at Childish Non-Relevant Rhetorical Questions
"You would think that.  But he doesn't like to listen, he instead fires those that disagree with him.  You think anyone thought Model X was a good idea? "
Selling is a nightmare. Customer services are a nightmare.
"You seem confused.  There is no special way for tesla to get at solar city assets or resources just because elon owns a part of both companies.

Buying SS was the only way to not waste 2 years.

Plus any crooked attempt to transfer assets before bankruptcy would most like result in a bunch of lawsuits from creditors and shareholders and make the bankruptcy last 5 years with tesla ultimately paying damages.

That is also a conspiracy theory for people like you, maybe tesla and ss already comingled assets in a way that would have caused serious problems if ss went through bankruptcy.  If anyone felt joint ventures between the two were delivering IP to tesla and leaving SS with nothing but a bill, that would be more lawsuits."
"I'd say the solar roofs are a bit of a distraction in your more narrow view of this deal. Musk is on record saying the biggest issue is trying to do joint deals for solar plus batteries.

If they aspire to do GW of these projects and don't really want to be doing a competitive selection process (ie they want to integrate their products exclusively) it was too much headache.

If this is true, with the merger closing, we should see a ton of new utility and commercial integrated solar+batrery deals announced next year"
"1) By being one company, they can make decisions that would otherwise being detrimental to one or the other and no longer need to exert undue effort on keeping arms length.  Being separate is akin to trying to play chess w/o sacrificing pieces; now they'll theoretically be more able to to the long term benefit of the combined entity (e.g. random hypothetical: Tesla can focus on designing inverters knowing that they'll have internal buyer rather than getting into bidding war with low-cost leader 3rd party of undetermined [good or bad] quality and thus theoretically reduce some uncertainties.)

2) In bankruptcy you'd have win-win situation for a 3rd party competitive/anti-[Tesla/SCTY] bidder (they either bid up the price, thus padding it and adding cost to TSLA, or deny TSLA some SCTY patents (the inexpensive panel manufacturing patents for example which may be well undervalued in light of future (unfamiliarly ubiquitious) global solar demand.)

3) Non-closely-allied holders may be more interested in short term cash-out and not have qualms to selling patents and/or patent veto rights to companies un-interested in utilizing the technology to its fullest (and perhaps even more interested in sitting-idle on it.  e.g. Cobysis(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobasys) (GM sold 60% share to oil co --LoL?--, w/ Panasonic ultimately fined and Toyota's NiMH use restricted IIRC)).  It can also result in bankruptcy sale to companies that are unconcerned w/ the long term health of Tesla and/or Solarcity.  Minority shareholder lawsuits can still go forth if they feel it's been sold at more loss than necessary (esp. if more generous/disruptive bidder is engaged.)[2]

If I were a opportunistic (perhaps Machiavellian/amoral) CEO of a Tesla competitor or industry that would get negatively impacted by Tesla, it'd make perfect strategic sense to bid in order to disrupt if the zero-sum cost/benefit(inc. disruption) was managable/worthwhile.  See indirectly related Blue Origin + ULA bidding on 39A launch complex (https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/1sqrl5/blue_origins_protest_regarding_lc_39a_denied/) --Elon's throwing shade (""unicorn"" in exhaust port references) and Nasa's smackdown (""flux capacitors"" & ""warp drives"" of) BO's request at the time were very surprising/amusing.

Spending a fraction of your market cap to ward off existential threat (.e.g, threat to Tesla's story, and access to funding, momentum, allied negotiation positions, government subsidies for plants) and esp. if the price for goods obtained is below market, could be considered prescient if not at least rational in some perspectives.
_____

[2] The most amusing, probably unlikely, scenario would be folks short selling Tesla while simultaneously choosing to outbid Tesla for SCTY plans to (A) delay SCTY plans and depress it's value & (B) steer a bear position to their advantage.  I'd hope anti-trust would protect from that, but I've lost much of my faith in the rigorousness of regulatory bodies and consider them partially captured by entrenched interests (basically setting expectations really low so I stop getting repeatedly disappointed =p.)

MS/Apple/Ericcson/Nokia collaborating/colluding to outbid Google(+ later Intel) for Nortel patents and layer troll Google hard with them via Rockstar-BidCo also comes to mind.  So, stranger things have happened.  $2B is cheap insurance.  Just like $12B was cheap (yes; cheap, esp. when considered in perspective of market cap and existential threat enabler) insurance for Facebook to deny competitor (Google) ownership and access to Whatsapp's userbase. (https://www.wired.com/2012/05/rockstar/)"
I'm pretty sure any place in America that drops that 'i' would also drop the 'g'. ;)
"You're claiming a business man worth 12 billion dollars is making bad decisions in the automotive industry where, time and time again, people say he's making a mistake and it turns out that he knew what he was doing. It's completely relevant to ask what your expertise it and what gives you the qualifications to seriously question him. Also you might want to Google what a rhetorical question is. "
"Are you talking Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy?  

I promise you, I am not confused.  "
"All of this might (MIGHT) make sense if Elon Musk wasn't ALREADY Chairman of Solar City, and his cousin wasn't ALREADY CEO of Solar City.

If Tesla had an inverter it wanted to sell, in your first example, it'd be no different than Solar City selling Tesla Powerwalls.  You know, something that has already (in theory) already happened.  (Though the number of first gen powerwalls delivered is debatable, it seems).
  
Who's the Chairman of the Solar City Board?

Even steering its way through bankruptcy, that would make a huge difference.  Why would Musk allow his own company that he co-founded to sell patents he thinks he needs?  He'd have to be removed as chairman of the board by the shareholders he doesn't already control first, before something like that could happen.

The necessity of integration seems borne from the fact that Solar City is sinking, and Musk thinks combining it with Tesla makes it too big to fail.  "
"A rhetorical question is one where the party asking doesn't care what the answer is - and no matter what my expertise is, you're going to discount it and ""praise Elon always right"" anyway.  If it wasn't rhetorical in theory, it certainly was in practice.

If the best automotive manufacturing mind in the world said tomorrow ""fuck it, I'm going to start a competitor to PayPal"", would you say ""well, he's really good at *business* so I'm sure it'll work""?? No, you would say success in one industry means dick-all in another, and he will either fail or have a long road of learning.

So why is the converse not true with Elon?  The model X was a terrible idea - he even admitted as such after the fact.  He's opened an assembly plant in one of the highest cost areas in the world - when trying to make money on a $40k car, that's going to look not very bright.  When you're selling $125,000 cars based on branding, you can get away with a lot of poor decisions.  When you try to enter the mainstream market, that margin of error goes away - and he hasn't shown he has a plan to avoid those errors.  Where does the workforce come from?  Where are you going to buy outsourced components cheaper than your competition?  How will you service 500,000 cars two years from now? Silence...instead he's going on about semi trucks and Mars and solar shingles.

He's ballsy and innovative, for sure.  That's great.  But he's also going in with zero experience to a bitterly competitive industry with low profit margins."
"Who knows how it would go down.  A chapter 7 if assets are sold piece by piece, an 11 if tesla or someone else bought the company as a whole.

It all depends on the potential buyers really."
"Yes, I'm aware of their positions.  

I considered it worthwhile because on surface at least Tesla could not have to sell at some margin or other to Solarcity, they can sell at cost but still consider Solarcity's sales' margin as theirs since they're a subsidiary now if the name is not retired.

Any risk of complains for special treatment is non-issue because it's expected a company would defer to its own product if it chose to.

No, once it's in bankruptcy the rules change.  They're responsible to creditors in addition to shareholders.  If SCTY turns down a higher bid from a competitor, they risk investor+creditor lawsuit (including from minority holders).  Even if creditor (minority or majority) shareholder lawsuits don't win, it can be considered an unacceptable risk to Elon's plans.  Dealing with bankruptcy, the legal overhead, misc. fiduciary duties, and avoiding random related landmines was just a non-starter.

No disagreement on the ""too big to fail""; (only harder to fail IMO, which I assume is what you meant.)  It's ultimately an interesting leveraging of Tesla's resources (financial/sales/engineering).  I'm very much looking forward to reading stories (both good and bad) of how it develops (ideally minimally the later of course... =}.)

I would have been interested in seeing if it was even possibel to add any poison pills if opting for bankruptcy to ward off unwaned parties or at least steer/funnel purchasers to specific behavior.  But that's a non-issue now."
"I totally share your concerns, I think that servicing the huge amounts of cars could be an issue, but I have faith that they know what they're doing. But my question was genuinely not rhetorical. If an automotive maker started a paypal competitor and surrounded himself with experts and has, for the past few years, managed the paypal competitor successfully I'd feel like I need to be in the field of online payment be able to reasonably critique what they're doing, especially if most experts and people involved think that what they're doing is the right choice.

My main point is that, so far, there isn't much to be concerned about. The shareholders support this idea. Musk supports this idea, and he has for the most part ran a solid automotive company. I don't see what the point is in claiming that it's not going to go well when the people with the most invested in it, and who most likely know more about what's going on than you and I, think this is a great thing to do. "
"I know how it would have gone down.  It would go down like (for example) the GM bankruptcy or the American Airlines bankruptcy.

Except in the reorganization, it would have been absorbed into Tesla as the guarantor of the portion of the debts not written off.
